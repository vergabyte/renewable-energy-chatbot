t e Renewable energy also called green energy is energy made from renewable natural resources that are replenished on a human timescale The most widely used renewable energy types are solar energy wind power and hydropower Bioenergy and geothermal power are also significant in some countries Some also consider nuclear power a renewable power source although this is controversial as nuclear energy requires mining uranium a nonrenewable resource Renewable energy installations can be large or small and are suited for both urban and rural areas Renewable energy is often deployed together with further electrification This has several benefits electricity can move heat and vehicles efficiently and is clean at the point of consumption Variable renewable energy sources are those that have a fluctuating nature such as wind power and solar power In contrast controllable renewable energy sources include dammed hydroelectricity bioenergy or geothermal power Percentages of various types of sources in the top renewable energy-producing countries across each geographical region in Renewable energy systems have rapidly become more efficient and cheaper over the past years A large majority of worldwide newly installed worldwide electricity capacity is now renewable Renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power have seen significant cost reductions over the past decade making them more competitive with traditional fossil fuels In some geographic localities photovoltaic solar or onshore wind is the cheapest new-build electricity From to renewable energy grew from to of the global electricity supply Power from the sun and wind accounted for most of this increase growing from a combined to Use of fossil energy shrank from to In renewables accounted for over of global electricity generation and are projected to reach over by Many countries already have renewables contributing more than of their total energy supply with some generating over half or even all their electricity from renewable sources The main motivation to use renewable energy instead of fossil fuels is to slow and eventually stop climate change which is mostly caused by their greenhouse gas emissions In general renewable energy sources pollute much less than fossil fuels The International Energy Agency estimates that to achieve net zero emissions by of global electricity will need to be generated by renewables Renewables also cause much less air pollution than fossil fuels improving public health and are less noisy The deployment of renewable energy still faces obstacles especially fossil fuel subsidies lobbying by incumbent power providers and local opposition to the use of land for renewable installations Like all mining the extraction of minerals required for many renewable energy technologies also results in environmental damage In addition although most renewable energy sources are sustainable some are not Overview edit Renewable energy sources especially solar photovoltaic and wind are generating an increasing share of electricity Coal oil and natural gas remain the primary global energy sources even as renewables have begun rapidly increasing See also Lists of renewable energy topics Definition edit Renewable energy is usually understood as energy harnessed from continuously occurring natural phenomena The International Energy Agency defines it as energy derived from natural processes that are replenished at a faster rate than they are consumed Solar power wind power hydroelectricity geothermal energy and biomass are widely agreed to be the main types of renewable energy Renewable energy often displaces conventional fuels in four areas electricity generation hot water space heating transportation and rural off-grid energy services Although almost all forms of renewable energy cause much fewer carbon emissions than fossil fuels the term is not synonymous with low-carbon energy Some non-renewable sources of energy such as nuclear power contradictory generate almost no emissions while some renewable energy sources can be very carbon-intensive such as the burning of biomass if it is not offset by planting new plants Renewable energy is also distinct from sustainable energy a more abstract concept that seeks to group energy sources based on their overall permanent impact on future generations of humans For example biomass is often associated with unsustainable deforestation Role in addressing climate change edit As part of the global effort to limit climate change most countries have committed to net zero greenhouse gas emissions In practice this means phasing out fossil fuels and replacing them with low-emissions energy sources This much needed process coined as low-carbon substitutions in contrast to other transition processes including energy additions needs to be accelerated multiple times in order to successfully mitigate climate change At the United Nations Climate Change Conference around three-quarters of the world s countries set a goal of tripling renewable energy capacity by The European Union aims to generate of its electricity from renewables by the same year Other benefits edit Main article Climate change mitigation Co-benefits Renewable energy is more evenly distributed around the world than fossil fuels which are concentrated in a limited number of countries It also brings health benefits by reducing air pollution caused by the burning of fossil fuels The potential worldwide savings in health care costs have been estimated at trillions of dollars annually Intermittency edit Main article Variable renewable energy Energy from sunlight or other renewable energy is converted to potential energy for storage in devices such as electric batteries The stored potential energy is later converted to electricity that is added to the power grid even when the original energy source is not available Estimated power demand over a week in May and May Germany showing the variability in solar and wind power both day-to-day and month-to-month The two most important forms of renewable energy solar and wind are intermittent energy sources they are not available constantly resulting in lower capacity factors In contrast fossil fuel power plants nuclear power plants and hydropower are usually able to produce precisely the amount of energy an electricity grid requires at a given time Solar energy can only be captured during the day and ideally in cloudless conditions Wind power generation can vary significantly not only day-to-day but even month-to-month This poses a challenge when transitioning away from fossil fuels energy demand will often be higher or lower than what renewables can provide In the medium-term this variability may require keeping some gas-fired power plants or other dispatchable generation on standby until there is enough energy storage demand response grid improvement or base load power from non-intermittent sources In the long-term energy storage is an important way of dealing with intermittency Using diversified renewable energy sources and smart grids can also help flatten supply and demand Sector coupling of the power generation sector with other sectors may increase flexibility for example the transport sector can be coupled by charging electric vehicles and sending electricity from vehicle to grid Similarly the industry sector can be coupled by hydrogen produced by electrolysis and the buildings sector by thermal energy storage for space heating and cooling Building overcapacity for wind and solar generation can help ensure sufficient electricity production even during poor weather In optimal weather it may be necessary to curtail energy generation if it is not possible to use or store excess electricity Electrical energy storage edit Main articles Energy storage and Grid energy storage Electrical energy storage is a collection of methods used to store electrical energy Electrical energy is stored during times when production especially from intermittent sources such as wind power tidal power solar power exceeds consumption and returned to the grid when production falls below consumption Pumped-storage hydroelectricity accounts for more than of all grid power storage Batteries are increasingly being deployed for storage and grid ancillary services and for domestic storage Green hydrogen is a more economical means of long-term renewable energy storage in terms of capital expenditures compared to pumped hydroelectric or batteries Energy supply security edit Two main renewable energy sources - solar power and wind power - are usually deployed in distributed generation architecture which offers specific benefits and comes with specific risks Notable risks are associated with centralisation of of the supply chains in a single country China in the photovoltaic sector Mass-scale installation of photovoltaic power inverters with remote control security vulnerabilities and backdoors results in cyberattacks that can disable generation from millions of physically decentralised panels resulting in disappearance of hundreds of gigawatts of installed power from the grid in one moment Similar attacks have targeted wind power farms through vulnerabilities in their remote control and monitoring systems The European NIS directive partially responds to these challenges by extending the scope of cybersecurity regulations to the energy generation market Recent analyses indicate that global solar photovoltaic capacity surpassed terawatt in providing about of global electricity supply Renewable energy infrastructure is also increasingly vulnerable to extreme weather events linked to climate change such as heat waves wildfires severe storms and flooding Solar farms can experience reduced output during prolonged heat or smoke conditions while wind turbines may require shutdowns during high-wind events or face damage from icing or wave action These climate-related stresses can threaten the continuity of electricity supply in regions with high shares of variable renewables As a result governments and grid operators are adopting climate-resilience standards hardening infrastructure and developing emergency-response protocols to maintain energy security under more frequent and severe weather conditions Mainstream technologies edit Renewable energy capacity has steadily grown led by solar photovoltaic power Solar energy edit Main articles Solar energy Solar power and Outline of solar energy Installed capacity and other key design parameters Value and year Global electricity power generation capacity GW Global electricity power generation capacity annual growth rate - Share of global electricity generation Levelized cost per

conditioning HVAC A small rooftop PV system in Bonn Germany Komekurayama photovoltaic power station in Kofu Japan Solar power produced around terrawatt-hours TWh worldwide in representing of the world s electricity Almost all of this growth has happened since Solar energy can be harnessed anywhere that receives sunlight however the amount of solar energy that can be harnessed for electricity generation is influenced by weather conditions geographic location and time of day There are two mainstream ways of harnessing solar energy solar thermal which converts solar energy into heat and photovoltaics PV which converts it into electricity PV is far more widespread accounting for around two thirds of the global solar energy capacity as of It is also growing at a much faster rate with GW newly installed capacity in compared to GW of solar thermal Passive solar refers to a range of construction strategies and technologies that aim to optimize the distribution of solar heat in a building Examples include solar chimneys orienting a building to the sun using construction materials that can store heat and designing spaces that naturally circulate air From to solar technology investments almost doubled from USD billion to USD billion driven by the sector s increasing maturity and cost reductions particularly in solar photovoltaic PV which accounted for of total investments China and the United States were the main recipients collectively making up about half of all solar investments since Despite reductions in Japan and India due to policy changes and COVID- growth in China the United States and a significant increase from Vietnam s feed-in tariff program offset these declines Globally the solar sector added gigawatts GW of solar PV and concentrated solar power CSP capacity between and with a notable rise in large-scale solar heating installations in especially in China Europe Turkey and Mexico In global solar power capacity grew by nearly driven by falling panel prices and expanded government incentives worldwide Photovoltaics edit Main articles Growth of photovoltaics Solar power by country and List of photovoltaic power stations Swanson s law stating that solar module prices have dropped about for each doubling of installed capacity defines the learning rate of solar photovoltaics A photovoltaic system consisting of solar cells assembled into panels converts light into electrical direct current via the photoelectric effect PV has several advantages that make it by far the fastest-growing renewable energy technology It is cheap low-maintenance and scalable adding to an existing PV installation as demanded arises is simple Its main disadvantage is its poor performance in cloudy weather PV systems range from small residential and commercial rooftop or building integrated installations to large utility-scale photovoltaic power station A household s solar panels can either be used for just that household or if connected to an electrical grid can be aggregated with millions of others The first utility-scale solar power plant was built in in Hesperia California by ARCO The plant was not profitable and was sold eight years later However over the following decades PV cells became significantly more efficient and cheaper As a result PV adoption has grown exponentially since Global capacity increased from GW at the end of to GW in PV grew fastest in China between and adding GW more than all advanced economies combined Four of the ten biggest solar power stations are in China including the biggest Golmud Solar Park in China Solar panels are recycled to reduce electronic waste and create a source for materials that would otherwise need to be mined but such business is still small and work is ongoing to improve and scale-up the process Solar thermal edit Main article Solar thermal energy Unlike photovoltaic cells that convert sunlight directly into electricity solar thermal systems convert it into heat They use mirrors or lenses to concentrate sunlight onto a receiver which in turn heats a water reservoir The heated water can then be used in homes The advantage of solar thermal is that the heated water can be stored until it is needed eliminating the need for a separate energy storage system Solar thermal power can also be converted to electricity by using the steam generated from the heated water to drive a turbine connected to a generator However because generating electricity this way is much more expensive than photovoltaic power plants there are very few in use today Floatovoltaics edit Main article Floating solar Floatovoltiacs or floating solar panels are solar panels floating on bodies of water There are both positive and negative points to this Some positive points are increased efficiency and price decrease of water space compared to land space A negative point is that making floating solar panels could be more expensive Agrivoltaics edit Main article Agrivoltaics Agrivoltaics is where there is simultaneous use of land for energy production and agriculture There are again both positive and negative points A positive viewpoint is there is a better use of land which leads to lower land costs A negative viewpoint is it the plants grown underneath would have to be plants that can grow well under shade such as Polka Dot Plant Pineapple Sage and Begonia Agrivoltaics not only optimizes land use and reduces costs by enabling dual revenue streams from both energy production and agriculture but it can also help moderate temperatures beneath the panels potentially reducing water loss and improving microclimates for crop growth However careful design and crop selection are crucial as the shading effect may limit the types of plants that can thrive necessitating the use of shade-tolerant species and innovative management practices Wind power edit Main articles Wind power and Wind power by country Wind energy generation by region over time Burbo NW-England Sunrise at the Fenton Wind Farm in Minnesota United States Installed capacity and other key design parameters Value and year Global electricity power generation capacity GW Global

applications Electricity pumping water windpump Humans have harnessed wind energy since at least BC Until the th century it was primarily used to power ships windmills and water pumps Today the vast majority of wind power is used to generate electricity using wind turbines Modern utility-scale wind turbines range from around kW to MW of rated power The power available from the wind is a function of the cube of the wind speed so as wind speed increases power output increases up to the maximum output for the particular turbine Areas where winds are stronger and more constant such as offshore and high-altitude sites are preferred locations for wind farms Wind-generated electricity met nearly of global electricity demand in with nearly GW of new wind power capacity installed Wind energy was the leading source of new capacity in Europe the US and Canada and the second largest in China In Denmark wind energy met more than of its electricity demand while Ireland Portugal and Spain each met nearly Globally the long-term technical potential of wind energy is believed to be five times total current global energy production or times current electricity demand assuming all practical barriers needed were overcome This would require wind turbines to be installed over large areas particularly in areas of higher wind resources such as offshore and likely also industrial use of new types of VAWT turbines in addition to the horizontal axis units currently in use As offshore wind speeds average greater than that of land offshore resources can contribute substantially more energy than land-stationed turbines Investments in wind technologies reached USD billion in with onshore wind dominating at of total investments from to Offshore wind investments nearly doubled to USD billion between and primarily due to policy incentives in China and expansion in Europe Global wind capacity increased by GW between and with capacity additions increasing by an average of each year Hydropower edit Main articles Hydroelectricity and Hydropower The Three Gorges Dam for hydropower on the Yangtze River in China Three Gorges Dam and Gezhouba Dam China Installed capacity and other key design parameters Value and year Global electricity power generation capacity GW Global electricity power generation capacity annual growth rate - Share of global electricity generation Levelized cost per megawatt hour USD Primary technology Dam Main applications Electricity pumped storage mechanical power Since water is about times denser than air even a slow flowing stream of water or moderate sea swell can yield considerable amounts of energy Water can generate electricity with a conversion efficiency of about which is the highest rate in renewable energy There are many forms of water energy Historically hydroelectric power came from constructing large hydroelectric dams and reservoirs which are still popular in developing countries The largest of them are the Three Gorges Dam in China and the Itaipu Dam built by Brazil and Paraguay Small hydro systems are hydroelectric power installations that typically produce up to MW of power They are often used on small rivers or as a low-impact development on larger rivers China is the largest producer of hydroelectricity in the world and has more than small hydro installations Run-of-the-river hydroelectricity plants derive energy from rivers without the creation of a large reservoir The water is typically conveyed along the side of the river valley using channels pipes or tunnels until it is high above the valley floor whereupon it can be allowed to fall through a penstock to drive a turbine A run-of-river plant may still produce a large amount of electricity such as the Chief Joseph Dam on the Columbia River in the United States However many run-of-the-river hydro power plants are micro hydro or pico hydro plants Much hydropower is flexible thus complementing wind and solar as it not intermittent In the world renewable hydropower capacity was GW Only a third of the world s estimated hydroelectric potential of TWh year has been developed New hydropower projects face opposition from local communities due to their large impact including relocation of communities and flooding of wildlife habitats and farming land High cost and lead times from permission process including environmental and risk assessments with lack of environmental and social acceptance are therefore the primary challenges for new developments It is popular to repower old dams thereby increasing their efficiency and capacity as well as quicker responsiveness on the grid Where circumstances permit existing dams such as the Russell Dam built in may be updated with pump back facilities for pumped-storage which is useful for peak loads or to support intermittent wind and solar power Because dispatchable power is more valuable than VRE countries with large hydroelectric developments such as Canada and Norway are spending billions to expand their grids to trade with neighboring countries having limited hydro Bioenergy edit Main article Bioenergy Further information Biomass energy Environmental impacts Installed capacity and other key design parameters Value and year Global electricity generation capacity GW Global electricity generation capacity annual growth rate - Share of global electricity generation Levelized cost per megawatt hour USD Primary technologies Biomass biofuel Main applications Electricity heating cooking transportation fuels Biomass is biological material derived from living or recently living organisms Most commonly it refers to plants or plant-derived materials As an energy source biomass can either be used directly via combustion to produce heat or converted to a more energy-dense biofuel like ethanol Wood is the most significant biomass energy source as of and is usually sourced from a trees cleared for silvicultural reasons or fire prevention Municipal wood waste for instance construction materials or sawdust is also often burned for energy The biggest per-capita producers of wood-based bioenergy are heavily forested countries like Finland Sweden Estonia Austria and Denmark Bioenergy can be environmentally destructive if old-growth forests are cleared to make way for crop production In particular demand for palm oil to produce biodiesel has contributed to the deforestation of tropical rainforests in Brazil and Indonesia In addition burning biomass still produces carbon emissions although much less than fossil fuels grams of CO per megajoule of energy compared to g MJ for fossil fuels Some biomass sources are unsustainable at current rates of exploitation as of A CHP power station using wood to supply households in France Biofuel edit Main article Biofuel See also Ethanol fuel Sustainable biofuel and Issues relating to biofuels Biofuels are primarily used in transportation providing of the world s transport energy demand in up from in Biojet is expected to be important for short-term reduction of carbon dioxide emissions from long-haul flights Aside from wood the major sources of bioenergy are bioethanol and biodiesel Bioethanol is usually produced by fermenting the sugar components of crops like sugarcane and maize while biodiesel is mostly made from oils extracted from plants such as soybean oil and corn oil Most of the crops used to produce bioethanol and biodiesel are grown specifically for this purpose although used cooking oil accounted for of the oil used to produce biodiesel as of The biomass used to produce biofuels varies by region Maize is the major feedstock in the United States while sugarcane dominates in Brazil In the European Union where biodiesel is more common than bioethanol rapeseed oil and palm oil are the main feedstocks China although it produces comparatively much less biofuel uses mostly corn and wheat In many countries biofuels are either subsidized or mandated to be included in fuel mixtures Sugarcane plantation to produce ethanol in Brazil There are many other sources of bioenergy that are more niche or not yet viable at large scales For instance bioethanol could be produced from the cellulosic parts of crops rather than only the seed as is common today Sweet sorghum may be a promising alternative source of bioethanol due to its tolerance of a wide range of climates Cow dung can be converted into methane There is also a great deal of research involving algal fuel which is attractive because algae is a non-food resource grows around times faster than most food crops and can be grown almost anywhere A bus fueled by biodiesel Geothermal energy edit Main articles Geothermal energy Geothermal power Renewable thermal energy and Geothermal energy in the United States Steam rising

Value and year Global electricity power generation capacity GW Global electricity power generation capacity annual growth rate - Share of global electricity generation Levelized cost per megawatt hour USD Primary technologies Dry steam flash steam and binary cycle power stations Main applications Electricity heating Geothermal energy is thermal energy heat extracted from the Earth s crust It originates from several different sources of which the most significant is slow radioactive decay of minerals contained in the Earth s interior as well as some leftover heat from the formation of the Earth Some of the heat is generated near the Earth s surface in the crust but some also flows from deep within the Earth from the mantle and core Geothermal energy extraction is viable mostly in countries located on tectonic plate edges where the Earth s hot mantle is more exposed As of the United States has by far the most geothermal capacity GW or less than of the country s total energy capacity followed by Indonesia and the Philippines Global capacity in was GW Geothermal energy can be either used directly to heat homes as is common in Iceland where almost all of its energy is renewable or to generate electricity Iceland is a global leader in renewable energy relying almost entirely on its abundant geothermal and hydroelectric resources derived from volcanic activity and glaciers At smaller scales geothermal power can be generated with geothermal heat pumps which can extract heat from ground temperatures of under C F allowing them to be used at relatively shallow depths of a few meters Electricity generation requires large plants and ground temperatures of at least C F In some countries electricity produced from geothermal energy accounts for a large portion of the total such as Kenya and Indonesia Technical advances may eventually make geothermal power more widely available For example enhanced geothermal systems involve drilling around kilometres mi into the Earth breaking apart hot rocks and extracting the heat using water In theory this type of geothermal energy extraction could be done anywhere on Earth Emerging technologies edit There are also other renewable energy technologies that are still under development including enhanced geothermal systems concentrated solar power cellulosic ethanol piezoelectricity and marine energy These technologies are not yet widely demonstrated or have limited commercialization Some may have potential comparable to other renewable energy technologies but still depend on further breakthroughs from research development and engineering Enhanced geothermal systems edit Main article Enhanced geothermal systems Enhanced geothermal systems EGS are a new type of geothermal power which does not require natural hot water reservoirs or steam to generate power Most of the underground heat within drilling reach is trapped in solid rocks not in water EGS technologies use hydraulic fracturing to break apart these rocks and release the heat they contain which is then harvested by pumping water into the ground The process is sometimes known as hot dry rock HDR Unlike conventional geothermal energy extraction EGS may be feasible anywhere in the world depending on the cost of drilling EGS projects have so far primarily been limited to demonstration plants as the technology is capital-intensive due to the high cost of drilling Sand battery edit Sand batteries are large tanks filled with soapstone that absorb heat Excess heat energy from renewable energy is piped into the tank and then energy is discharged as boiling water steam or heated air Finland is using this technology in Pornainen as Polar Night Energy built a MW sand battery that can store up to MWh that went online in Piezoelectricity edit Piezoelectricity is the conversion of existing mechanical stress or vibration classical mechanics into an electrical charge without consuming or depleting a fuel source Piezotronics enables the interaction of piezoelectric and semiconducting behaviors to modulate energy barriers at contact surface thereby controlling charge carrier transport Since the introduction of nanogenerators the efficiency of microscale energy harvesting has improved For instance nanogenerators typically consist of piezoelectric nanowires as these wires bend or compress the applied mechanical stress causes the ions within the material s crystal lattice to shift their positions This shift disrupts the nanowire s charge symmetry which causes an instantaneous charge polarization separation of positive and negative charges across the nanowire s ends Once polarized electrons are freed from the attached electrode which generates usable alternating current AC electricity that can energize low-power sensors Piezoelectric microelectromechanical systems piezoMEMS such as actuators for artificial organs and pacemakers or micropumps for drug delivery and reagent transfers are vital for medical purposes and energy harvesting Furthermore specialized components like piezoelectric resonators and quartz crystal oscillators are used to regulate electrical circuit frequencies Marine energy edit Main article Marine energy Aerial view of Sihwa Tidal Power Station in South Korea Marine energy also sometimes referred to as ocean energy is the energy carried by ocean waves tides salinity and ocean temperature differences Technologies to harness the energy of moving water include wave power marine current power and tidal power Reverse electrodialysis RED is a technology for generating electricity by mixing fresh water and salty sea water in large power cells Most marine energy harvesting technologies are still at low technology readiness levels and not used at large scales Tidal energy is generally considered the most mature but has not seen wide deployment The world s largest tidal power station is on Sihwa Lake South Korea which produces around gigawatt-hours of electricity per year Earth infrared thermal radiation edit Earth emits roughly W of infrared thermal radiation that flows toward the cold outer space Solar energy hits the surface and atmosphere of the earth and produces heat Using various theorized devices like emissive energy harvester EEH or thermoradiative diode this energy flow can be converted into electricity In theory this technology can be used during nighttime Others edit Algae fuels edit Main article Algae fuels Producing liquid fuels from oil-rich fat-rich varieties of algae is an ongoing research topic Various microalgae grown in open or closed systems are being tried including some systems that can be set up in brownfield and desert lands Space-based solar power edit Main article Space-based solar power There have been numerous proposals for space-based solar power in which very large satellites with photovoltaic panels would be equipped with microwave transmitters to beam power back to terrestrial receivers A study by the NASA Office of Science and Technology Policy examined the concept and concluded that with current and near-future technologies it would be economically uncompetitive Water vapor edit Collection of static electricity charges from water droplets on metal surfaces is an experimental technology that would be especially useful in low-income countries with relative air humidity over Nuclear energy edit Breeder reactors could in principle depending on the fuel cycle employed extract almost all of the energy contained in uranium or thorium decreasing fuel requirements by a factor of compared to widely used once-through light water reactors which extract less than of the energy in the actinide metal uranium or thorium mined from the earth The high fuel-efficiency of breeder reactors could greatly reduce concerns about fuel supply energy used in mining and storage of radioactive waste With seawater uranium extraction currently too expensive to be economical there is enough fuel for breeder reactors to satisfy the world s energy needs for billion years at s total energy consumption rate thus making nuclear energy effectively a renewable energy In addition to seawater the average crustal granite rocks contain significant quantities of uranium and thorium with which breeder reactors can supply abundant energy for the remaining lifespan of the sun on the main sequence of stellar evolution Artificial photosynthesis edit Main article Artificial photosynthesis Artificial photosynthesis uses techniques including nanotechnology to store solar electromagnetic energy in chemical bonds by splitting water to produce hydrogen and then using carbon dioxide to make methanol Researchers in this field strived to design molecular mimics of photosynthesis that use a wider region of the solar spectrum employ catalytic systems made from abundant inexpensive materials that are robust readily repaired non-toxic stable in a variety of environmental conditions and perform more efficiently allowing a greater proportion of photon energy to end up in the storage compounds i e carbohydrates rather than building and sustaining living cells However prominent research faces hurdles Sun Catalytix a MIT spin-off stopped scaling up their prototype fuel-cell in because it offers few savings over other ways to make hydrogen from sunlight Recent research emphasizes that while artificial photosynthesis shows promise in splitting water to generate hydrogen its broader significance lies in the ability to produce dense carbon-based solar fuels suitable for transport applications such as aviation and long-haul shipping These fuels if derived from carbon dioxide and water using sunlight could close the carbon loop and reduce reliance on fossil-based hydrocarbons However realizing this potential requires overcoming major technical hurdles including the development of efficient durable catalysts for water oxidation and CO reduction and careful attention to land use and public perception Comparison of the theoretical and practical potentials of different renewable energy technologies edit Global energy consumption in was approximately petawatt-hours PWh per

including all renewable energy sources the global technical potential ranges from to PWh year which is to times the electricity consumption of PWh year Economic Potential edit The literature assessing the global economic potential of renewables shows that the economic potential is higher than current and near-future electricity demand More specifically Around of the world s solar resource and of its wind resource is already economically competitive compared with local fossil fuel generation Market and industry trends edit Main article Renewable energy commercialization Most new renewables are solar followed by wind then hydro then bioenergy Investment in renewables especially solar tends to be more effective in creating jobs than coal gas or oil Worldwide renewables employ about million people as of with solar PV being the technology employing the most at almost million However as of February the world s supply of workforce for solar energy is lagging greatly behind demand as universities worldwide still produce more workforce for fossil fuels than for renewable energy industries In China accounted for almost half of the global increase in renewable electricity There are gigawatts installed in countries while countries have laws regulating the renewable energy sector Globally in there are over million jobs associated with the renewable energy industries with solar photovoltaics being the largest renewable employer The clean energy sectors added about million jobs globally between and totaling million jobs by Usage by sector or application edit Some studies say that a global transition to renewable energy across all sectors power heat transport and industry is feasible and economically viable One of the efforts to decarbonize transportation is the increased use of electric vehicles EVs Despite that and the use of biofuels such as biojet less than of transport energy is from renewables Occasionally hydrogen fuel cells are used for heavy transport Meanwhile in the future electrofuels may also play a greater role in decarbonizing hard-to-abate sectors like aviation and maritime shipping Solar water heating makes an important contribution to renewable heat in many countries most notably in China which now has of the global total GWth Most of these systems are installed on multi-family apartment buildings and meet a portion of the hot water needs of an estimated million households in China Worldwide total installed solar water heating systems meet a portion of the water heating needs of over million households Heat pumps provide both heating and cooling and also flatten the electric demand curve and are thus an increasing priority Renewable thermal energy is also growing rapidly About of heating and cooling energy is from renewables Cost comparison edit The International Renewable Energy Agency IRENA stated that GW of renewable capacity added in had lower costs than electricity generated from fossil fuels IRENA also stated that capacity added since reduced electricity bills in by at least billion and that in non-OECD countries the lifetime savings of capacity additions will reduce costs by up to billion Installed

Bioenergy Geothermal All other values for Growth of renewables edit Investment and sources Investment Companies governments and households have committed increasing amounts to decarbonization including renewable energy solar wind electric vehicles and associated charging infrastructure energy storage energy-efficient heating systems carbon capture and storage and hydrogen By investment in the energy transition had grown to about twice that for fossil fuels oil natural gas and coal The countries most reliant on fossil fuels for electricity vary widely on how great a portion of that electricity is generated from renewables leaving wide variation in renewables growth potential Costs Levelized cost With increasingly widespread implementation of renewable energy sources costs have declined most notably for energy generated by solar panels Levelized cost of energy LCOE is a measure of the average net present cost of electricity generation for a generating plant over its lifetime Past costs of producing renewable energy declined significantly with of total renewable power generation added in having lower costs than the cheapest new fossil fuel option Learning curves Trend of costs and deployment over time with steeper lines showing greater cost reductions as deployment progresses With increased deployment renewables benefit from learning curves and economies of scale The results of a recent review of the literature concluded that as greenhouse gas GHG emitters begin to be held liable for damages resulting from GHG emissions resulting in climate change a high value for liability mitigation would provide powerful incentives for deployment of renewable energy technologies In the decade of worldwide investment in renewable energy capacity excluding large hydropower amounted to US trillion of which the top countries China contributed US billion the United States contributed US billion Japan contributed US billion Germany contributed US billion and the United Kingdom contributed US billion This was an increase of over three and possibly four times the equivalent amount invested in the decade of no data is available for As of an estimated of the world s

growing by almost GW in its main forecast equal to the entire installed power capacity of China in This is an acceleration from the previous five years and almost higher than what the IEA forecast in its report making its largest ever upward revision Renewables are set to account for over of global electricity capacity expansion over the forecast period To achieve net zero emissions by IEA believes that of global electricity generation will need to be produced from renewable sources In June IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol said that countries should invest more in renewables to ease the pressure on consumers from high fossil fuel prices make our energy systems more secure and get the world on track to reach our climate goals China s five year plan to includes increasing direct heating by renewables such as geothermal and solar thermal REPowerEU the EU plan to escape dependence on fossil Russian gas is expected to call for much more green hydrogen After a transitional period renewable energy production is expected to make up most of the world s energy production In the risk management firm DNV GL forecasts that the world s primary energy mix will be split equally between fossil and non-fossil sources by Middle eastern nations are also planning on reducing their reliance fossil fuel Many planned green projects will contribute in of energy supply for the region by

Province Saudi Arabia NEOM Green Hydrogen Project in NEOM Saudi Arabia Gulf of Suez Wind Power Project in Suez Egypt Al-Ajban Solar Park in Abu Dhabi UAE Demand edit In July WWF and the World Resources Institute convened a discussion among a number of major US companies who had declared their intention to increase their use of renewable energy These discussions identified a number of principles which companies seeking greater access to renewable energy considered important market deliverables These principles included choice between suppliers and between products cost competitiveness longer term fixed price supplies access to third-party financing vehicles and collaboration UK statistics released in September noted that the proportion of demand met from renewables varies from a low of per cent for transport mainly from biofuels to highs of over per cent for other final users which is largely the service and commercial sectors that consume relatively large quantities of electricity and industry In some locations individual households can opt to purchase renewable energy through a consumer green energy program Developing countries edit This section is an excerpt from Renewable energy in developing countries edit Renewable energy in developing countries is an increasingly used alternative to fossil fuel energy as these countries scale up their energy supplies and address energy poverty Renewable energy technology was once seen as unaffordable for developing countries However since investment in non-hydro renewable energy has been higher in developing countries than in developed countries and comprised of global renewable energy investment in The International Energy Agency forecasts that renewable energy will provide the majority of energy supply growth through in Africa and Central and South America and of supply growth in China Most developing countries have abundant renewable energy resources including solar energy wind power geothermal energy and biomass as well as the ability to manufacture the relatively labor-intensive systems that harness these By developing such energy sources developing countries can reduce their dependence on oil and natural gas creating energy portfolios that are less vulnerable to price rises In many circumstances these investments can be less expensive than fossil fuel energy systems In Kenya the Olkaria V Geothermal Power Station is one of the largest in the world The Grand Ethiopia Renaissance Dam project incorporates wind turbines Once completed Morocco s Ouarzazate Solar Power Station is projected to provide power to over a million people Policy edit Deaths caused as a result of fossil fuel use areas of rectangles in chart greatly exceed those resulting from production of renewable energy rectangles barely visible in chart Policies to support renewable energy have been vital in their expansion Where Europe dominated in establishing energy policy in the early s most countries around the world now have some form of energy policy The International Renewable Energy Agency IRENA is an intergovernmental organization for promoting the adoption of renewable energy worldwide It aims to provide concrete policy advice and facilitate capacity building and technology transfer IRENA was formed in with countries signing the charter of IRENA As of April IRENA has member states The then United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has said that renewable energy can lift the poorest nations to new levels of prosperity and in September he launched the UN Sustainable Energy for All initiative to improve energy access efficiency and the deployment of renewable energy The Paris Agreement on climate change motivated many countries to develop or improve renewable energy policies In a total of countries adopted some form of renewable energy policy National targets that year existed in countries In addition there is also a wide range of policies at the state provincial and local levels Some public utilities help plan or install residential energy upgrades Many national state and local governments have created green banks A green bank is a quasi-public financial institution that uses public capital to leverage private investment in clean energy technologies Green banks use a variety of financial tools to bridge market gaps that hinder the deployment of clean energy Global and national policies related to renewable energy can be divided based on sectors such as agriculture transport buildings industry Climate neutrality net zero emissions by the year is the main goal of the European Green Deal For the European Union to reach their target of climate neutrality one goal is to decarbonise its energy system by aiming to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by Finance edit Electrified transport and renewable energy are key areas of investment for climate change mitigation via an energy transition China s count of multi-country patent filings has surged since the mid- s leading in batteries and solar though Europe still dominates in wind energy and smart grids China also leads in highly cited publications in global peer-reviewed journals The International Renewable Energy Agency s IRENA report on renewable energy finance highlights steady investment growth since USD billion in a increase from USD billion in up from and USD billion in higher This trend is driven by increasing recognition of renewable energy s role in mitigating climate change and enhancing energy security along with investor interest in alternatives to fossil fuels Policies such as feed-in tariffs in China and Vietnam have significantly increased renewable adoption Furthermore from to installation costs for solar photovoltaic PV onshore wind and offshore wind fell by and respectively making renewables more cost-effective Between and the renewable energy sector underwent a significant realignment of investment priorities Investment in solar and wind energy technologies markedly increased In contrast other renewable technologies such as hydropower including pumped storage hydropower biomass biofuels geothermal and marine energy experienced a substantial decrease in financial investment Notably from to investment in these alternative renewable technologies declined by falling from USD billion to USD billion In the renewable energy sector experienced a significant surge in investments particularly in solar and wind technologies totaling approximately USD billion a increase from the previous year The increased investments in contributed between and to the GDP in key regions including the United States China the European Union and India The energy sector receives investments of approximately USD trillion each year with USD trillion directed towards clean energy technologies and infrastructure To meet the targets set in the Net Zero Emissions NZE Scenario by this investment must increase to USD trillion per year Debates edit Main articles Renewable energy debate Green job and Intermittent power source Further information Climate change mitigation Overviews strategies and comparisons of measures Nuclear power proposed as renewable energy edit The Leibstadt Nuclear Power Plant in Switzerland This section is an excerpt from Nuclear power proposed as renewable energy edit Whether nuclear power should be considered a form of renewable energy is an ongoing subject of debate Statutory definitions of renewable energy usually exclude many present nuclear energy technologies with the notable exception of the U S state of Utah Dictionary-sourced definitions of renewable energy technologies often omit or explicitly exclude mention of nuclear energy sources with an exception made for the natural nuclear decay heat generated within the Earth The most common fuel used in conventional nuclear fission power stations uranium- is non-renewable according to the United States Energy Information Administration the organization however is silent on the recycled MOX fuel The National Renewable Energy Laboratory does not mention nuclear power in its energy basics definition In the Brundtland Commission WCED classified fission reactors that produce more fissile nuclear fuel than they consume breeder reactors and if developed fusion power among conventional renewable energy sources such as solar power and hydropower The monitoring and storage of radioactive waste products is also required upon the use of other renewable energy sources such as geothermal energy Geopolitics edit See also Russia in the European energy sector A concept of a super grid The geopolitical impact of the growing use of renewable energy is a subject of ongoing debate and research Many fossil-fuel producing countries such as Qatar Russia Saudi Arabia and Norway are currently able to exert diplomatic or geopolitical influence as a result of their oil wealth Most of these countries are expected to be among the geopolitical losers of the energy transition although some like Norway are also significant producers and exporters of renewable energy Fossil fuels and the infrastructure to extract them may in the long term become stranded assets It has been speculated that countries dependent on fossil fuel revenue may one day find it in their interests to quickly sell off their remaining fossil fuels Conversely nations abundant in renewable resources and the minerals required for renewables technology are expected to gain influence In particular China has become the world s dominant manufacturer of the technology needed to produce or store renewable energy especially solar panels wind turbines and lithium-ion batteries Nations rich in solar and wind energy could become major energy exporters Some may produce and export green hydrogen although electricity is projected to be the dominant energy carrier in accounting for almost of total energy consumption up from in Countries with large uninhabited areas such as Australia China and many African and Middle Eastern countries have a potential for huge installations of renewable energy The production of renewable energy technologies requires rare-earth elements with new supply chains Countries with already weak governments that rely on fossil fuel revenue may face even higher political instability or popular unrest Analysts consider Nigeria Angola Chad Gabon and Sudan all countries with a history of military coups to be at risk of instability due to dwindling oil income A study found that transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy systems reduces risks from mining trade and political dependence because renewable energy systems don t need fuel they depend on trade only for the acquisition of materials and components during construction In October European Commissioner for Climate Action Frans Timmermans suggested the best answer to the global energy crisis is to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels He said those blaming the European Green Deal were doing so for perhaps ideological reasons or sometimes economic reasons in protecting their vested interests Some critics blamed the European Union Emissions Trading System EU ETS and closure of nuclear plants for contributing to the energy crisis European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said that Europe is too reliant on natural gas and too dependent on natural gas imports According to Von der Leyen The answer has to do with diversifying our suppliers and crucially with speeding up the transition to clean energy Metal and mineral extraction edit See also Environmental footprint of electric cars and Rare-earth element Environmental considerations The transition to renewable energy requires increased extraction of certain metals and minerals Like all mining this impacts the environment and can lead to environmental conflict For example lithium mining uses around of the water in the Salar de Atamaca desert forcing farmers and llama herders to abandon their ancestral settlements and creating environment degradation in several African countries the green energy transition has created a mining boom causing deforestation and threatening already endangered species Wind power requires large amounts of copper and zinc as well as smaller amounts of the rarer metal neodymium Solar power is less resource-intensive but still requires significant amounts of aluminum The expansion of electrical grids requires both copper and aluminum Batteries which are critical to enable storage of renewable energy use large quantities of copper nickel aluminum and graphite Demand for lithium is expected to grow -fold from to Demand for nickel cobalt and graphite is expected to grow by a factor of about For each of the most relevant minerals and metals its mining is dominated by a single country copper in Chile nickel in Indonesia rare earths in China cobalt in the Democratic Republic of the Congo DRC and lithium in Australia China dominates processing of all of these Recycling these metals after the devices they are embedded in are spent is essential to create a circular economy and ensure renewable energy is sustainable By recycled copper lithium cobalt and nickel from spent batteries could reduce combined primary supply requirements for these minerals by around A controversial approach is deep sea mining Minerals can be collected from new sources like polymetallic nodules lying on the seabed This would damage local biodiversity but proponents point out that biomass on resource-rich seabeds is much scarcer than in the mining regions on land which are often found in vulnerable habitats like rainforests Due to co-occurrence of rare-earth and radioactive elements thorium uranium and radium rare-earth mining results in production of low-level radioactive waste Conservation areas edit Installations used to produce wind solar and hydropower are an increasing threat to key conservation areas with facilities built in areas set aside for nature conservation and other environmentally sensitive areas They are often much larger than fossil fuel power plants needing areas of land up to times greater than coal or gas to produce equivalent energy amounts More than renewable energy facilities are built and more are under construction in areas of environmental importance and threaten the habitats of plant and animal species across the globe The authors team emphasized that their work should not be interpreted as anti-renewables because renewable energy is crucial for reducing carbon emissions The key is ensuring that renewable energy facilities are built in places where they do not damage biodiversity In scientists published a world map of areas that contain renewable energy materials as well as estimations of their overlaps with Key Biodiversity Areas Remaining Wilderness and Protected Areas The authors assessed that careful strategic planning is needed Impact of climate change on renewable energy production edit Climate change is making weather patterns less predictable This can seriously hamper the use of renewable energy For example in the year in Sudan and Namibia hydropower production dropped by more than half due to drastic reduction in rainfall in China India and some regions in Africa unusual weather phenomena reduced the amount of produced wind energy heatwaves and clouds reduce the effectiveness of solar panels melting glaciers create problems to hydropower Nuclear energy is also affected as drought creates water shortage so nuclear power plants sometimes do not have enough water for cooling Society and culture edit Public support edit Most respondents to a climate survey conducted in - by the European Investment Bank say countries should back renewable energy to fight climate change The same survey a year later shows that renewable energy is considered an investment priority in the European Union China and the United States Acceptance of wind and solar facilities in one s community is stronger among U S Democrats blue while acceptance of nuclear power plants is stronger among U S Republicans red Solar power plants may compete with arable land while on-shore wind farms often face opposition due to aesthetic concerns and noise Such opponents are often described as NIMBYs not in my back yard Some environmentalists are concerned about fatal collisions of birds and bats with wind turbines Although protests against new wind farms occasionally occur around the world regional and national surveys generally find broad support for both solar and wind power Community-owned wind energy is sometimes proposed as a way to increase local support for wind farms A UK Government document stated that projects are generally more likely to succeed if they have broad public support and the consent of local communities This means giving communities both a say and a stake In the s and early s many renewable projects in Germany Sweden and Denmark were owned by local communities particularly through cooperative structures In the years since more installations in Germany have been undertaken by large companies but community ownership remains strong in Denmark History edit See also History of climate change policy and politics Prior to the development of coal in the mid th century nearly all energy used was renewable The oldest known use of renewable energy in the form of traditional biomass to fuel fires dates from more than a million years ago The use of biomass for fire did not become commonplace until many hundreds of thousands of years later The second oldest usage of renewable energy was probably harnessing the wind in order to drive ships over water This practice can be traced back some years to ships in the Persian Gulf and on the Nile Geothermal energy from hot springs has been used for bathing since Paleolithic times and space heating since ancient Roman times Moving into the time of recorded history the primary sources of traditional renewable energy were human labor animal power water power wind in grain crushing windmills and firewood a traditional biomass In Werner Siemens commenting on the discovery of the photovoltaic effect in the solid state wrote In conclusion I would say that however great the scientific importance of this discovery may be its practical value will be no less obvious when we reflect that the supply of solar energy is both without limit and without cost and that it will continue to pour down upon us for countless ages after all the coal deposits of the earth have been exhausted and forgotten Max Weber mentioned the end of fossil fuel in the concluding paragraphs of his Die protestantische Ethik und der Geist des Kapitalismus The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism published in Development of solar engines continued until the outbreak of World War I The importance of solar energy was recognized in a Scientific American article in the far distant future natural fuels having been exhausted solar power will remain as the only means of existence of the human race The theory of peak oil was published in In the s environmentalists promoted the development of renewable energy both as a replacement for the eventual depletion of oil as well as for an escape from dependence on oil and the first electricity-generating wind turbines appeared Solar had long been used for heating and cooling but solar panels were too costly to build solar farms until New government spending regulation and policies helped the renewables industry weather the financial crisis and the Great Recession better than many other sectors In renewables accounted for of global electricity generation up from in Ancient Historical Examples edit Among the most notable historical uses of renewable energy in the form of ancient and traditional methods the following examples can be highlighted Windmills in Europe and Asia such as the windmills of the Netherlands and Nashtifan in Iran The earliest discovered verified designs of windmills date back to Iran between and CE Water mills Ancient China and Ancient Persia Archimedes burning lens Traditional cooling and ventilation systems based on windcatchers and Solar updraft tower or Solar chimney Traditional architecture aware of natural heat transfer and natural energy transformation processes Gravity-based fountains Using animal biomass in ancient fuel bricks Solar ovens and furnaces in ancient China India Egypt and Persia Solar energy applications

million sq ft km The three towers of the Ivanpah Solar Power Facility Part of the MW SEGS solar complex in northern San Bernardino County California Bird s eye view of Khi Solar One South Africa Concentrated solar power CSP also known as concentrating solar power concentrated solar thermal systems generate solar power by using mirrors or lenses to concentrate a large area of sunlight into a receiver Electricity is generated when the concentrated light is converted to heat solar thermal energy which drives a heat engine usually a steam turbine connected to an electrical power generator or powers a thermochemical reaction As of global installed capacity of concentrated solar power stood at GW As of the total was GW with the inclusion of three new CSP projects in construction in China and in Dubai in the UAE The U S -based National Renewable Energy Laboratory NREL which maintains a global database of CSP plants counts GW of operational capacity and another GW under construction By comparison solar power reached TW of global capacity in of which the overwhelming majority was photovoltaic Comparison between CSP and other electricity sources edit As a thermal energy generating power station CSP has more in common with thermal power stations such as coal gas or geothermal A CSP plant can incorporate thermal energy storage which stores energy either in the form of sensible heat or as latent heat for example using molten salt which enables these plants to continue supplying electricity whenever it is needed day or night This makes CSP a dispatchable form of solar Dispatchable renewable energy is particularly valuable in places where there is already a high penetration of photovoltaics PV such as California because demand for electric power peaks near sunset just as PV capacity ramps down a phenomenon referred to as duck curve CSP is often compared to photovoltaic solar PV since they both use solar energy While solar PV experienced huge growth during the s due to falling prices solar CSP growth has been slow due to technical difficulties and high prices In CSP represented less than of worldwide installed capacity of solar electricity plants However CSP can more easily store energy during the night making it more competitive with dispatchable generators and baseload plants The DEWA project in Dubai under construction in held the world record for lowest CSP price in at US per MWh for its MW combined trough and tower project MW of trough MW of tower with hours of thermal energy storage daily Base-load CSP tariff in the extremely dry Atacama region of Chile reached below MWh in auctions History edit Solar steam engine for water pumping near Los Angeles circa A legend has it that Archimedes used a burning glass to concentrate sunlight on the invading Roman fleet and repel them from Syracuse In a Greek scientist Dr Ioannis Sakkas curious about whether Archimedes could really have destroyed the Roman fleet in BC lined up nearly Greek sailors each holding an oblong mirror tipped to catch the sun s rays and direct them at a tar-covered plywood silhouette m ft away The ship caught fire after a few minutes however historians continue to doubt the Archimedes story In Auguste Mouchout used a parabolic trough to produce steam for the first solar steam engine The first patent for a solar collector was obtained by the Italian Alessandro Battaglia in Genoa Italy in Over the following years inv ntors such as John Ericsson and Frank Shuman developed concentrating solar-powered d vices for irrigation refrig ration and locom tion In Shuman finished a horsepower kW parabolic solar thermal energy station in Maadi Egypt for irrigation The first solar-power system using a mirror dish was built by Dr R H Goddard who was already well known for his research on liquid-fueled rockets and wrote an article in in which he asserted that all the previous obstacles had been addressed Professor Giovanni Francia designed and built the first concentrated-solar plant which entered into operation in Sant Ilario near Genoa Italy in This plant had the architecture of today s power tower plants with a solar receiver in the center of a field of solar collectors The plant was able to produce MW with superheated steam at bar and C The MW Solar One power tower was developed in Southern California in Solar One was converted into Solar Two in implementing a new design with a molten salt mixture sodium nitrate potassium nitrate as the receiver working fluid and as a storage medium The molten salt approach proved effective and Solar Two operated successfully until it was decommissioned in The parabolic-trough technology of the nearby Solar Energy Generating Systems SEGS begun in was more workable The MW SEGS was the largest solar power plant in the world until No commercial concentrated solar was constructed from when SEGS was completed until when the Compact linear Fresnel reflector system at Liddell Power Station in Australia was built Few other plants were built with this design although the MW Kimberlina Solar Thermal Energy Plant opened in In MW Nevada Solar One was built a trough design and the first large plant since SEGS Between and Spain built over parabolic trough systems size constrained at no more than MW by the support scheme Where not bound in other countries the manufacturers have adopted up to MW size for a single unit with a cost soft point around MW for a single unit Due to the success of Solar Two a commercial power plant called Solar Tres Power Tower was built in Spain in later renamed Gemasolar Thermosolar Plant Gemasolar s results paved the way for further plants of its type Ivanpah Solar Power Facility was constructed at the same time but without thermal storage using natural gas to preheat water each morning Most concentrated solar power plants use the parabolic trough design instead of the power tower or Fresnel systems There have also been variations of parabolic trough systems like the integrated solar combined cycle ISCC which combines troughs and conventional fossil fuel heat systems CSP was originally treated as a competitor to photovoltaics and Ivanpah was built without energy storage although Solar Two included several hours of thermal storage By prices for photovoltaic plants had fallen and PV commercial power was selling for of contemporary CSP contracts However increasingly CSP was being bid with to hours of thermal energy storage making CSP a dispatchable form of solar energy As such it is increasingly seen as competing with natural gas and PV with batteries for flexible dispatchable power Current technology edit CSP is used to produce electricity sometimes called solar thermoelectricity usually generated through steam Concentrated solar technology systems use mirrors or lenses with tracking systems to focus a large area of sunlight onto a small area The concentrated light is then used as heat or as a heat source for a conventional power plant solar thermoelectricity The solar concentrators used in CSP systems can often also be used to provide industrial process heating or cooling such as in solar air conditioning Concentrating technologies exist in four optical types namely parabolic trough dish concentrating linear Fresnel reflector and solar power tower Parabolic trough and concentrating linear Fresnel reflectors are classified as linear focus collector types while dish and solar tower are point focus types Linear focus collectors achieve medium concentration factors suns and over and point focus collectors achieve high concentration factors over suns Although simple these solar concentrators are quite far from the theoretical maximum concentration For example the parabolic-trough concentration gives about of the theoretical maximum for the design acceptance angle that is for the same overall tolerances for the system Approaching the theoretical maximum may be achieved by using more elaborate concentrators based on nonimaging optics Different types of concentrators produce different peak temperatures and correspondingly varying thermodynamic efficiencies due to differences in the way that they track the sun and focus light New innovations in CSP technology are leading systems to become more and more cost-effective In Australia s national science agency CSIRO tested a CSP arrangement in which tiny ceramic particles fall through the beam of concentrated solar energy the ceramic particles capable of storing a greater amount of heat than molten salt while not requiring a container that would diminish heat transfer Parabolic trough edit Main article Parabolic trough Parabolic trough at a plant near Harper Lake California Diagram of linear parabolic reflector concentrating sun rays to heat working fluid A parabolic trough consists of a linear parabolic reflector that concentrates light onto a receiver positioned along the reflector s focal line The receiver is a tube positioned at the longitudinal focal line of the parabolic mirror and filled with a working fluid The reflector follows the sun during the daylight hours by tracking along a single axis A working fluid e g molten salt is heated to C F as it flows through the receiver and is then used as a heat source for a power generation system Trough systems are the most developed CSP technology The Solar Energy Generating Systems SEGS plants in California some of the longest-running in the world until their closure Acciona s Nevada Solar One near Boulder City Nevada and Andasol Europe s first commercial parabolic trough plant are representative along with Plataforma Solar de Almer a s SSPS-DCS test facilities in Spain Enclosed trough edit The design encapsulates the solar thermal system within a greenhouse-like glasshouse The glasshouse creates a protected environment to withstand the elements that can negatively impact reliability and efficiency of the solar thermal system Lightweight curved solar-reflecting mirrors are suspended from the ceiling of the glasshouse by wires A single-axis tracking system positions the mirrors to retrieve the optimal amount of sunlight The mirrors concentrate the sunlight and focus it on a network of stationary steel pipes also suspended from the glasshouse structure Water is carried throughout the length of the pipe which is boiled to generate steam when intense solar radiation is applied Sheltering the mirrors from the wind allows them to achieve higher temperature rates and prevents dust from building up on the mirrors GlassPoint Solar the company that created the Enclosed Trough design states its technology can produce heat for Enhanced Oil Recovery EOR for about per kWh BTU in sunny regions compared to between and for other conventional solar thermal technologies Solar power tower edit Main articles Solar power tower and Solar furnace Ashalim Power Station Israel on its completion the tallest solar tower in the world It concentrates light from over heliostats The PS solar power plant in Andalusia Spain concentrates sunlight from a field of heliostats onto a central solar power tower A solar power tower consists of an array of dual-axis tracking reflectors heliostats that concentrate sunlight on a central receiver atop a tower the receiver contains a heat-transfer fluid which can consist of water-steam or molten salt Optically a solar power tower is the same as a circular Fresnel reflector The working fluid in the receiver is heated to C K or F and then used as a heat source for a power generation or energy storage system An advantage of the solar tower is the reflectors can be adjusted instead of the whole tower Power-tower development is less advanced than trough systems but they offer higher efficiency and better energy storage capability Beam down tower application is also feasible with heliostats to heat the working fluid CSP with dual towers are also used to enhance the conversion efficiency by nearly The Solar Two in Daggett California and the CESA- in Plataforma Solar de Almeria Almeria Spain are the most representative demonstration plants The Planta Solar PS in Sanlucar la Mayor Spain is the first commercial utility-scale solar power tower in the world The MW Ivanpah Solar Power Facility located in the Mojave Desert was the largest CSP facility in the world and uses three power towers Ivanpah generated only TWh of its energy from solar means and the other TWh was generated by burning natural gas Supercritical carbon dioxide can be used instead of steam as heat-transfer fluid for increased electricity production efficiency However because of the high temperatures in arid areas where solar power is usually located it is impossible to cool down carbon dioxide below its critical temperature in the compressor inlet Therefore supercritical carbon dioxide blends with higher critical temperatures are currently in development Fresnel reflectors edit Main article Compact linear Fresnel reflector Fresnel reflectors are made of many thin flat mirror strips to concentrate sunlight onto tubes through which working fluid is pumped Flat mirrors allow more reflective surface in the same amount of space than a parabolic reflector thus capturing more of the available sunlight and they are much cheaper than parabolic reflectors Fresnel reflectors can be used in various size CSPs Fresnel reflectors are sometimes regarded as a technology with a worse output than other methods The cost efficiency of this model is what causes some to use this instead of others with higher output ratings Some new models of Fresnel reflectors with Ray Tracing capabilities have begun to be tested and have initially proved to yield higher output than the standard version Dish Stirling edit See also Solar thermal energy Dish designs A dish Stirling A dish Stirling or dish engine system consists of a stand-alone parabolic reflector that concentrates light onto a receiver positioned at the reflector s focal point The reflector tracks the Sun along two axes The working fluid in the receiver is heated to C F and then used by a Stirling engine to generate power Parabolic-dish systems provide high solar-to-electric efficiency between and and their modular nature provides scalability The Stirling Energy Systems SES United Sun Systems USS and Science Applications International Corporation SAIC dishes at UNLV and Australian National University s Big Dish in Canberra Australia are representative of this technology A world record for solar to electric efficiency was set at by SES dishes at the National Solar Thermal Test Facility NSTTF in New Mexico on January a cold bright day According to its developer Ripasso Energy a Swedish firm in its dish Stirling system tested in the Kalahari Desert in South Africa showed efficiency The SES installation in Maricopa Phoenix was the largest Stirling Dish power installation in the world until it was sold to United Sun Systems Subsequently larger parts of the installation have been moved to China to satisfy part of the large energy demand CSP with thermal energy storage edit See also Thermal energy storage and Solar thermal energy In a CSP plant that includes storage the solar energy is first used to heat molten salt or synthetic oil which is stored providing thermal heat energy at high temperature in insulated tanks Later the hot molten salt or oil is used in a steam generator to produce steam to generate electricity by steam turbo generator as required Thus solar energy which is available in daylight only is used to generate electricity round the clock on demand as a load following power plant or solar peaker plant The thermal storage capacity is indicated in hours of power generation at nameplate capacity Unlike solar PV or CSP without storage the power generation from solar thermal storage plants is dispatchable and self-sustainable similar to coal gas-fired power plants but without the pollution CSP with thermal energy storage plants can also be used as cogeneration plants to supply both electricity and process steam round the clock As of December CSP with thermal energy storage plants generation costs have ranged between c kWh and c kWh depending on good to medium solar radiation received at a location Unlike solar PV plants CSP with thermal energy storage can also be used economically around the clock to produce process steam replacing polluting fossil fuels CSP plants can also be integrated with solar PV for better synergy CSP with thermal storage systems are also available using Brayton cycle generators with air instead of steam for generating electricity and or steam round the clock These CSP plants are equipped with gas turbines to generate electricity These are also small in capacity MW with flexibility to install in few acres area Waste heat from the power plant can also be used for process steam generation and HVAC needs In case land availability is not a limitation any number of these modules can be installed up to MW with RAMS and cost advantages since the per MW costs of these units are lower than those of larger size solar thermal stations Centralized district heating round the clock is also feasible with concentrated solar thermal storage plants Deployment around the world edit Main articles List of solar thermal power stations and Solar power by country Worldwide CSP capacity since in MW p National CSP capacities in MW p Country Total Added Spain United States South Africa Morocco India China United Arab Emirates Saudi Arabia Algeria Egypt Italy Australia Thailand Source REN Global Status Report and An early plant operated in Sicily at Adrano The US deployment of CSP plants started by with the SEGS plants The last SEGS plant was completed in From to no CSP plants were built anywhere in the world Global installed CSP-capacity increased nearly tenfold between and and grew at an average of percent per year during the last five of those years as the number of countries with installed CSP was growing In worldwide installed capacity increased by or nearly gigawatt GW to more than GW The record for capacity installed was reached in corresponding to MW however it was followed by a decline caused by policy changes the financial crisis and the rapid decrease in price of the photovoltaic cells Nevertheless total capacity reached MW in Spain accounted for almost one third of the world s capacity at MW despite no new capacity entering commercial operation in the country since The United States follows with MW Interest is also notable in North Africa and the Middle East as well as China and India There is a notable trend towards developing countries and regions with high solar radiation with several large plants under construction in Worldwide Concentrated Solar Power MW p Year - Installed - Cumulative Sources REN CSP-world com IRENA HeliosCSP The global market was initially dominated by parabolic-trough plants which accounted for of CSP plants at one point Since about central power tower CSP has been favored in new plants due to its higher temperature operation up to C F vs trough s maximum of C F which promises greater efficiency Among the larger CSP projects are the Ivanpah Solar Power Facility MW in the United States which uses solar power tower technology without thermal energy storage and the Ouarzazate Solar Power Station in Morocco which combines trough and tower technologies for a total of MW with several hours of energy storage Cost edit As early as the rapid decline of the price of photovoltaic systems led to projections that CSP would no longer be economically viable As of the least expensive utility-scale concentrated solar power stations in the United States and worldwide were five times more expensive than utility-scale photovoltaic power stations with a projected minimum price of cents per kilowatt-hour for the most advanced CSP stations against record lows of cents per kWh for utility-scale PV This five-fold price difference has been maintained since Some hybrid PV-CSP plants in China have sought to operate profitably on the regional coal tariff of US cents per kWh in Even though overall deployment of CSP remains limited in the early s the levelized cost of power from commercial scale plants has decreased since the s With a learning rate estimated at around cost reduction of every doubling in capacity the costs were approaching the upper end of the fossil fuel cost range at the beginning of the s driven by support schemes in several countries including Spain the US Morocco South Africa China and the UAE LCOE of Concentrating Solar Power from to Energy storage edit Some researchers expect CSP in combination with Thermal Energy Storage TES to become cheaper than PV with lithium batteries for storage durations above hours per day while others such as NREL expects that by PV with -hour storage lithium batteries will cost the same as PV with -hour storage used to cost in leaving CSP no cost advantage when it comes to energy storage Regardless of these cost projections energy storage solutions remain essential as they improve stability and reliability by reducing the impact of renewable intermittency and power factor mismatch Efficiency edit The efficiency of a concentrating solar power system depends on the technology used to convert the solar power to electrical energy the operating temperature of the receiver and the heat rejection thermal losses in the system and the presence or absence of other system losses in addition to the conversion efficiency the optical system which concentrates the sunlight will also add additional losses Real-world systems claim a maximum thermal to electrical conversion efficiency of - for power tower type systems operating at temperatures from to C with the higher efficiency number assuming a combined cycle turbine Dish Stirling systems operating at temperatures of - C claim an efficiency of about with the record solar-to-grid conversion efficiency of the highest recorded efficiency for any field solar technology set by Sandia in and a slightly slightly higher record of solar-to-electric system efficiency reported by the U S Department of Energy Due to variation in sun incidence during the day the average conversion efficiency achieved is not equal to these maximum efficiencies and the net annual solar-to-electricity efficiencies are - for pilot power tower systems and - for demonstration-scale Stirling dish systems Theory edit The solar energy to electrical power conversion efficiency is the product of several factors the fraction of solar energy captured accounting for optical losses in the solar concentration system the heating efficiency accounting for thermal losses in the element receiving the solar energy and the thermal conversion efficiency the efficiency of converting heat energy to electrical power The maximum conversion efficiency of any thermal to electrical energy system is given by the Carnot efficiency which represents a theoretical limit to the efficiency that can be achieved by any system set by the laws of thermodynamics Real-world systems do not achieve the Carnot efficiency The conversion efficiency displaystyle eta of the incident solar radiation into

practical Carnot cycle losses not included in the above analysis Incentives and markets edit Spain edit Andasol Solar Power Station in Spain In Spain launched the first commercial scale CSP market in Europe Until solar-thermal electricity generation was initially eligible for feed-in tariff payments art RD leading to the creation of the largest CSP fleet in the world which at GW of installed capacity contributes about TWh of power to the Spanish grid every year The initial requirements for plants in the FiT were Systems registered in the register of systems prior to September MW for solar-thermal systems Systems registered after September PV only The capacity limits for the different system types were re-defined during the review of the application conditions every quarter art RD Annex III RD Prior to the end of an application period the market caps specified for each system type are published on the website of the Ministry of Industry Tourism and Trade art RD Because of cost concerns Spain has halted acceptance of new projects for the feed-in-tariff on January Already accepted projects were affected by a solar-tax on feed-in-tariffs effectively reducing the feed-in-tariff In this context the Spanish Government enacted the Royal Decree-Law in aimed at the adoption of urgent measures to guarantee the economic and financial stability of the electric system laying the foundations of the new Law of the Spanish electricity sector This new retroactive legal-economic framework applied to all the renewable energy systems was developed in by the RD which abolished the former regulatory frameworks set by the RD and the RD and defined a new remuneration scheme for these assets After a lost decade for CSP in Europe Spain announced in its National Energy and Climate Plan with the intention of adding GW of CSP capacity between and Towards this end bi-annual auctions of MW of CSP capacity starting in October are expected but details are not yet known Australia edit Main article Solar power in Australia Several CSP dishes have been set up in remote Aboriginal settlements in the Northern Territory Hermannsburg Yuendumu and Lajamanu So far no commercial scale CSP project has been commissioned in Australia but several projects have been suggested In now-bankrupt American CSP developer SolarReserve was awarded a PPA to realize the MW Aurora Solar Thermal Power Project in South Australia at a record low rate of just AUD kWh or close to USD kWh However the company failed to secure financing and the project was cancelled Another application for CSP in Australia are mines that need electricity but often have no grid connection Vast Solar a startup company aiming to commercialize a novel modular third generation CSP design was looking to start construction of a MW combined CSP and PV facility in Mt Isa of North-West Queensland by and a MW CSP system with multiple smaller solar towers near Port Augusta with million Australian Renewable Energy Agency grant plus up to million of other funding after At the federal level under the Large-scale Renewable Energy Target LRET in operation under the Renewable Energy Electricity Act large-scale solar thermal electricity generation from accredited RET power stations may be entitled to create large-scale generation certificates LGCs These certificates can then be sold and transferred to liable entities usually electricity retailers to meet their obligations under this tradeable certificates scheme However as this legislation is technology neutral in its operation it tends to favour more established RE technologies with a lower levelised cost of generation such as large-scale onshore wind rather than solar thermal and CSP At state level renewable energy feed-in laws typically are capped by maximum generation capacity in kWp and are open only to micro or medium scale generation and in a number of instances are only open to solar photovoltaic PV generation This means that larger scale CSP projects would not be eligible for payment for feed-in incentives in many of the State and Territory jurisdictions China edit The China Energy Engineering Corporation MW Hami power tower has hours of molten-salt storage Main article Solar power in China Concentrated solar power In China is offering second generation CSP technology to compete with other on-demand electricity generation methods based on renewable or non-renewable fossil fuels without any direct or indirect subsidies In the current th five-year plan CSP projects are developed in several provinces alongside large GW sized solar PV and wind projects In China announced its intention to build a batch of technologically diverse CSP demonstration projects in the context of the th five-year plan with the intention of building up an internationally competitive CSP industry Since the first plants were completed in the generated electricity from the plants with thermal storage is supported with an administratively set FiT of RMB per kWh At the end of China operated a total of MW in CSP plants seven plants MW are molten-salt towers another two plants MW use the proven Eurotrough parabolic trough design and three plants MW use linear Fresnel collectors Plans to build a second batch of demonstration projects were never enacted and further technology specific support for CSP in the upcoming th five-year plan is unknown Federal support projects from the demonstration batch ran out at the end of India edit In March SECI announced that a RfQ for MW would be called in the year Solar thermal reactors edit CSP has other uses than electricity Researchers are investigating solar thermal reactors for the production of solar fuels making solar a fully transportable form of energy in the future These researchers use the solar heat of CSP as a catalyst for thermochemistry to break apart molecules of H O to create hydrogen H from solar energy with no carbon emissions By splitting both H O and CO other much-used hydrocarbons for example the jet fuel used to fly commercial airplanes could also be created with solar energy rather than from fossil fuels Heat from the sun can be used to provide steam used to make heavy oil less viscous and easier to pump This process is called solar thermal enhanced oil recovery Solar power towers and parabolic troughs can be used to provide the steam which is used directly so no generators are required and no electricity is produced Solar thermal enhanced oil recovery can extend the life of oilfields with very thick oil which would not otherwise be economical to pump Carbon neutral synthetic fuel production using concentrated solar thermal energy at nearly C temperature is technically feasible and will be commercially viable in the future if the costs of CSP plants decline Also carbon-neutral hydrogen can be produced with solar thermal energy CSP using the sulfur iodine cycle hybrid sulfur cycle iron oxide cycle copper chlorine cycle zinc zinc oxide cycle cerium IV oxide cerium III oxide cycle or an alternative Gigawatt-scale solar power plants edit Around the turn of the millennium up to about there have been several proposals for gigawatt-size very-large-scale solar power plants using CSP They include the Euro-Mediterranean Desertec proposal and Project Helios in Greece GW both now canceled A study concluded that the world could generate TWh each year from very large-scale solar power plants using of each of the world s deserts Total consumption worldwide was TWh year in The gigawatt size projects would have been arrays of standard-sized single plants In the BLM made available acres hectares of land in the southwestern United States for solar projects enough for between and GW The largest single plant in operation is the MW Noor Solar Power Station In the MW CSP th phase of the GW Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park in Dubai will become the largest solar complex featuring CSP Suitable sites edit The locations with highest direct irradiance are dry at high altitude and located in the tropics These locations have a higher potential for CSP than areas with less sun Abandoned opencast mines moderate hill slopes and crater depressions may be advantageous in the case of power tower CSP as the power tower can be located on the ground integral with the molten salt storage tank Environmental effects edit CSP has a number of environmental impacts particularly by the use of water and land Water is generally used for cooling and to clean mirrors Some projects are looking into various approaches to reduce the water and cleaning agents used including the use of barriers non-stick coatings on mirrors water misting systems and others Water use edit Concentrating solar power plants with wet-cooling systems have the highest water-consumption intensities of any conventional type of electric power plant only fossil-fuel plants with carbon-capture and storage may have higher water intensities A study comparing various sources of electricity found that the median water consumption during operations of concentrating solar power plants with wet cooling was cubic metres per megawatt-hour US gal MWh for power tower plants and m MWh US gal MWh for trough plants This was higher than the operational water consumption with cooling towers for nuclear at m MWh US gal MWh coal at m MWh US gal MWh or natural gas at m MWh US gal MWh A study by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory came to similar conclusions for power plants with cooling towers water consumption during operations was m MWh US gal MWh for CSP trough m MWh US gal MWh for CSP tower m MWh US gal MWh for coal m MWh US gal MWh for nuclear and m MWh US gal MWh for natural gas The Solar Energy Industries Association noted that the Nevada Solar One trough CSP plant consumes m MWh US gal MWh The issue of water consumption is heightened because CSP plants are often located in arid environments where water is scarce In the US Congress directed the Department of Energy to report on ways to reduce water consumption by CSP The subsequent report noted that dry cooling technology was available that although more expensive to build and operate could reduce water consumption by CSP by to percent A hybrid wet dry cooling system could reduce water consumption by to percent A report by NREL noted that of the operating CSP power plants in the US used dry cooling systems The four dry-cooled systems were the three power plants at the Ivanpah Solar Power Facility near Barstow California and the Genesis Solar Energy Project in Riverside County California Of CSP projects under construction or development in the US as of March were wet systems were dry systems hybrid and unspecified Although many older thermoelectric power plants with once-through cooling or cooling ponds use more water than CSP meaning that more water passes through their systems most of the cooling water returns to the water body available for other uses and they consume less water by evaporation For instance the median coal power plant in the US with once-through cooling uses m MWh US gal MWh but only m MWh US gal MWh less than one percent is lost through evaporation Effects on wildlife edit Dead warbler burned in mid-air by solar thermal power plant Insects can be attracted to the bright light caused by concentrated solar technology and as a result birds that hunt them can be killed by being burned if they fly near the point where light is being focused This can also affect raptors that hunt the birds Federal wildlife officials were quoted by opponents as calling the Ivanpah power towers mega traps for wildlife Some media sources have reported that concentrated solar power plants have injured or killed large numbers of birds due to intense heat from the concentrated sunrays Some of the claims may have been overstated or exaggerated According to rigorous reporting in over six months of its first year of operation bird fatalities were counted at Ivanpah of which were related to sunlight being reflected onto the boilers Over a year this figure rose to a total count of bird fatalities from known causes and from unknown causes Taking into account the search efficiency of the dead bird carcasses the total avian mortality for the first year was estimated at for known causes and from unknown causes Of the bird deaths due to known causes were burned died of collision effects and died from other causes Mitigations actions can be taken to reduce these numbers such as focusing no more than four mirrors on any one place in the air during standby as was done at Crescent Dunes Solar Energy Project Over the - period bird fatalities were directly accounted for at Ivanpah a figure consistent with the ranges found in previous annual assessments In more general terms a preliminary study assessed that the annual bird mortality per MW of installed power was similar between U S

capacity of GWh Thermal energy storage tower inaugurated in in Bozen-Bolzano South Tyrol Italy Construction of the salt tanks at the Solana Generating Station which provide thermal energy storage to allow generation during night or peak demand The MW plant is designed to provide six hours of energy storage This allows the plant to generate about percent of its rated capacity over the course of a year Thermal energy storage TES is the storage of thermal energy for later reuse Employing widely different technologies it allows thermal energy to be stored for hours days or months Scale both of storage and use vary from small to large from individual processes to district town or region Usage examples are the balancing of energy demand between daytime and nighttime storing summer heat for winter heating or winter cold for summer cooling Seasonal thermal energy storage Storage media include water or ice-slush tanks masses of native earth or bedrock accessed with heat exchangers by means of boreholes deep aquifers contained between impermeable strata shallow lined pits filled with gravel and water and insulated at the top as well as eutectic solutions and phase-change materials Other sources of thermal energy for storage include heat or cold produced with heat pumps from off-peak lower cost electric power a practice called peak shaving heat from combined heat and power CHP power plants heat produced by renewable electrical energy that exceeds grid demand and waste heat from industrial processes Heat storage both seasonal and short term is considered an important means for cheaply balancing high shares of variable renewable electricity production and integration of electricity and heating sectors in energy systems almost or completely fed by renewable energy Categories edit The kinds of thermal energy storage can be divided into three separate categories sensible heat latent heat and thermo-chemical heat storage Each of these has different advantages and disadvantages that determine their applications Sensible heat storage edit Sensible heat storage SHS is the most straightforward method It simply means the temperature of some medium is either increased or decreased This type of storage is the most commercially available out of the three other techniques are less developed The materials are generally inexpensive and safe One of the cheapest most commonly used options is a water tank but materials such as molten salts or metals can be heated to higher temperatures and therefore offer a higher storage capacity Energy can also be stored underground UTES either in an underground tank or in some kind of heat-transfer fluid HTF flowing through a system of pipes either placed vertically in U-shapes boreholes or horizontally in trenches Yet another system is known as a packed-bed or pebble-bed storage unit in which some fluid usually air flows through a bed of loosely packed material usually rock pebbles or ceramic brick to add or extract heat A disadvantage of SHS is its dependence on the properties of the storage medium Storage capacities are limited by the specific heat capacity of the storage material and the system needs to be properly designed to ensure energy extraction at a constant temperature Sensible heat storages normally have a low energy density which means that they require large volumes and space for storage tanks and a slow loss of thermal energy over time even with the installations alongside the sensible heat storage Heat storage in tanks ponds or rock caverns edit See also Steam accumulator A steam accumulator consists of an insulated steel pressure tank containing hot water and steam under pressure As a heat storage device it is used to mediate heat production by a variable or steady source from a variable demand for heat Steam accumulators may take on a significance for energy storage in solar thermal energy projects Heat storage tanks are being used globally primarily in regions with established district heating networks and in sunny areas for a use of concentrated solar power These tanks serve in residential commercial and industrial purposes ranging from seasonal heating to balancing renewable energy grids This is an example of a sensible heat storage device that has both its benefits and disadvantages See also Hot water storage tank Water has one of the highest thermal capacities at kJ kg K Large stores mostly hot water storage tanks are widely used in Nordic countries to store heat for several days to decouple heat and power production and to help meet peak demands Some towns use insulated ponds heated by solar power as a heat source for district heating pumps Intersessional storage in caverns has been investigated and appears to be economical and plays a significant role in heating in Finland Energy producer Helen Oy estimates an GWh capacity and MW thermal output for its m water cistern under Mustikkamaa fully charged or discharged in days at capacity operating from to offset days of peak production demand while the m rock caverns m under sea level in Kruunuvuorenranta near Laajasalo were designated in to store heat in summer from warm seawater and release it in winter for district heating In it was announced that the municipal energy supplier of Vantaa had commissioned an underground heat storage facility of over cubic metres cu ft in size and GWh in capacity to be built expected to be operational in Molten salt technology edit Main article Molten-salt battery The sensible heat of molten salt is also used for storing solar energy at a high temperature termed molten-salt technology or molten salt energy storage MSES Molten salts can be employed as a thermal energy storage method to retain thermal energy Presently this is a commercially used technology to store the heat collected by concentrated solar power e g from a solar power tower or solar trough The heat can later be converted into superheated steam to power conventional steam turbines and generate electricity at a later time It was demonstrated in the Solar Two project from to Estimates in predicted an annual efficiency of a reference to the energy retained by storing heat before turning it into electricity versus converting heat directly into electricity Various eutectic mixtures of different salts are used e g sodium nitrate potassium nitrate and calcium nitrate Experience with such systems exists in non-solar applications in the chemical and metals industries as a heat-transport fluid The salt melts at C F It is kept liquid at C F in an insulated cold storage tank The liquid salt is pumped through panels in a solar collector where the focused sun heats it to C F It is then sent to a hot storage tank With proper insulation of the tank the thermal energy can be usefully stored for up to a week When electricity is needed the hot molten salt is pumped to a conventional steam-generator to produce superheated steam for driving a conventional turbine generator set as used in a coal oil or nuclear power plant A -megawatt turbine would need a tank of about metres ft tall and metres ft in diameter to drive it for four hours by

transporter Rail transport Tram Rapid transit Personal rapid transit Category Renewable energy portal v t e A single tank with a divider plate to separate cold and hot molten salt is under development It is more economical by achieving more heat storage per unit volume over the dual tanks system as the molten-salt storage tank is costly due to its complicated construction phase-change material PCMs are also used in molten-salt energy storage while research on obtaining shape-stabilized PCMs using high porosity matrices is ongoing Most solar thermal power plants use this thermal energy storage concept The Solana Generating Station in the U S can store hours worth of generating capacity in molten salt During the summer of the Gemasolar Thermosolar solar power-tower molten-salt plant in Spain achieved a first by continuously producing electricity hours per day for days The Cerro Dominador Solar Thermal Plant inaugurated in June has hours of heat storage Silicon edit Solid or molten silicon offers much higher storage temperatures than salts with consequent greater capacity and efficiency It is being researched as a possible more energy efficient storage technology Silicon is able to store more than MWh of energy per cubic meter at C An additional advantage is the relative abundance of silicon when compared to the salts used for the same purpose Hot silicon thermal energy storing technology would be able to store significant thermal energy at extremely high temperatures around - C This would be utilized by using the white hot molten silicon to store excess electricity generated from surrounding renewable sources like solar energy and wind power This system would enable efficient lower costing and a longer duration of energy storage compared to other sensible heat storage options Aluminum edit Another medium that can store thermal energy is molten recycled aluminum This technology was developed by the Swedish company Azelio The material is heated to C When needed the energy is transported to a Stirling engine using a heat-transfer fluid Molten aluminum is not widely used for energy storage due to some disadvantages that have yet to be overcome This includes molten aluminum s reactivity and the challenges that come along with handling the solidification of the aluminum However research is being continued on how aluminum thermal storage could be used due to its high energy density These aluminum based storage technologies have the potential to grow and to integrate renewable energy sources like solar and wind into the grid These energy storage technologies are promising candidates for long term storage with minimal loss Rock sand concrete edit Rock sand and concrete has a heat capacity about one third of water s On the other hand concrete can be heated to much higher temperatures C by for example electrical heating and therefore has a much higher overall volumetric capacity Thus in the example below an insulated cube of about m would appear to provide sufficient storage for a single house to meet of heating demand This could in principle be used to store surplus wind or solar heat due to the ability of electrical heating to reach high temperatures At the neighborhood level the Wiggenhausen-S d solar development at Friedrichshafen in southern Germany has received international attention This features a m cu ft reinforced concrete thermal store linked to m sq ft of solar collectors which will supply the houses with around of their heating and hot water Siemens-Gamesa built a MWh thermal storage near Hamburg with C in basalt and MW electric output A similar system was scheduled for Sor Denmark with of the stored MWh heat returned for the town s district heating and returned as electricity but not retained Disadvantages to the use of hot rocks and concrete involve both of their heat capacity compared to water about one third meaning that much larger volumes of solid materials are required to store the same amount of energy making it less suitable for storage areas with limited amount of space Their challenges also relate to their implementations and maintenance Over time with these materials heat loss is inevitable the degradation of the materials and their high initial costs all bring up contemplation of use Relating to the integration difficulties they require a challenging design to connect the storage and heat source to a distribution system Brick toaster is a recently August announced innovative heat reservoir operating at up to C F Polar Night Energy installed a thermal battery in Finland that stores heat in a mass of sand It was expected to reduce carbon emissions from the local heating network by as much as It is about ft m tall and ft m wide It can store MWh with a round trip efficiency of Temperatures reach F C The heat transfer medium is air which can reach temperatures of F C can produce steam for industrial processes or it can supply district heating using a heat exchanger Research is evaluating sintered bauxite proppants as the thermal store heating them up to C This material was tested against plasma-sprayed alumina and mullite alumina fiber reinforced alumina matrix and mullite fiber reinforced mullite ceramic matrix composites These four materials were considered because of their usefulness as solar receivers transport tubes and storage tanks Latent heat storage edit Because latent heat storage LHS is associated with a phase transition the general term for the associated media is phase-change material PCM During these transitions heat can be added or extracted without affecting the material s temperature giving it an advantage over SHS-technologies Storage capacities are often higher as well There are a multitude of PCMs available including but not limited to salts polymers gels paraffin waxes metal alloys and semiconductor-metal alloys each with different properties This allows for a more target-oriented system design As the process is isothermal at the PCM s melting point the material can be picked to have the desired temperature range Desirable qualities include high latent heat and thermal conductivity Furthermore the storage unit can be more compact if volume changes during the phase transition are small PCMs are further subdivided into organic inorganic and eutectic materials Compared to organic PCMs inorganic materials are less flammable cheaper and more widely available They also have higher storage capacity and thermal conductivity Organic PCMs on the other hand are less corrosive and not as prone to phase-separation Eutectic materials as they are mixtures are more easily adjusted to obtain specific properties but have low latent and specific heat capacities Another important factor in LHS is the encapsulation of the PCM Some materials are more prone to erosion and leakage than others The system must be carefully designed in order to avoid unnecessary loss of heat Miscibility gap alloy technology edit Miscibility gap alloys rely on the phase change of a metallic material see latent heat to store thermal energy Rather than pumping the liquid metal between tanks as in a molten-salt system the metal is encapsulated in another metallic material that it cannot alloy with immiscible Depending on the two materials selected the phase changing material and the encapsulating material storage densities can be between and MJ L A working fluid typically water or steam is used to transfer the heat into and out of the system Thermal conductivity of miscibility gap alloys is often higher up to W m K than competing technologies which means quicker charge and discharge of the thermal storage is possible The technology has not yet been implemented on a large scale However The miscibility Gap Alloy technology is being primarily implemented in Australia this is where it was developed by the University of Newcastle researchers and is being brought to the market by the company MGA thermal Applications of this are slowly popping up around other parts of the world such as a planned demonstration plant in Europe with a Swiss commercial partner to store renewable energy and provide clean power Ice-based technology edit Main article Ice storage air conditioning Several applications are being developed where ice is produced during off-peak periods and used for cooling at a later time For example air conditioning can be provided more economically by using low-cost electricity at night to freeze water into ice then using the cooling capacity of ice in the afternoon to reduce the electricity needed to handle air conditioning demands Thermal energy storage using ice makes use of the large heat of fusion of water Historically ice was transported from mountains to cities for use as a coolant One metric ton of water one cubic meter can store million joules MJ or BTUs kWh A relatively small storage facility can hold enough ice to cool a large building for a day or a week Currently ice storage air conditioning is being used globally with there being significant use in the United States in mostly hotels commercial buildings and universities Its other place of use is in China specifically in public utilities in Shenzhen Other places where it is being used but less notable would be in Japan Turkey and Malaysia Song et al This technology is effective in areas with high cooling demand and areas with a distinguishable time of lower electricity rates this is what the lower pricing is reliant upon This allows for the storage of cold energy to be mainly produced during low-cost hours for use during high demand periods Disadvantages that this form of cold energy storing technology come with include high initial costs and the need for significant physical space of the large storage tanks There may also be lower energy efficiency due to the chillers performing at lower temperatures in order to make ice In addition to using ice in direct cooling applications it is also being used in heat pump-based heating systems In these applications the phase change energy provides a very significant layer of thermal capacity that is near the bottom range of temperature that water source heat pumps can operate in This allows the system to ride out the heaviest heating load conditions and extends the timeframe by which the source energy elements can contribute heat back into the system Cryogenic energy storage edit Main article Cryogenic energy storage Cryogenic energy storage uses liquification of air or nitrogen as an energy store A pilot cryogenic energy system that uses liquid air as the energy store and low-grade waste heat to drive the thermal re-expansion of the air operated at a power station in Slough UK in Cryogenic Energy storage is a good option for energy use since it is able to be location independent As long as there is the space needed for the storage of these containers it would be possible to build This energy storage is also known to have the ability for long storage duration although it does have high costs for standalone systems This makes sense because there is an essential high energy input needed for the liquefaction process of non-toxic materials Thermo-chemical heat storage edit Thermo-chemical heat storage TCS involves some kind of reversible exotherm endotherm chemical reaction with thermo-chemical materials TCM Depending on the reactants this method can allow for an even higher storage capacity than LHS In one type of TCS heat is applied to decompose certain molecules The reaction products are then separated and mixed again when required resulting in a release of energy Some examples are the decomposition of potassium oxide over a range of C with a heat decomposition of MJ kg lead oxide C MJ kg and calcium hydroxide above C where the reaction rates can be increased by adding zinc or aluminum The photochemical decomposition of nitrosyl chloride can also be used and since it needs photons to occur works especially well when paired with solar energy Adsorption or Sorption solar heating and storage edit Adsorption processes also fall into this category It can be used to not only store thermal energy but also control air humidity Zeolites microporous crystalline alumina-silicates and silica gels are well suited for this purpose In hot humid environments this technology is often used in combination with lithium chloride to cool water The low cost ton and high cycle rate of synthetic zeolites such as Linde X with water adsorbate has garnered much academic and commercial interest recently for use for thermal energy storage TES specifically of low-grade solar and waste heat Several pilot projects have been funded in the EU from to the present The basic concept is to store solar thermal energy as chemical latent energy in the zeolite Typically hot dry air from flat plate solar collectors is made to flow through a bed of zeolite such that any water adsorbate present is driven off Storage can be diurnal weekly monthly or even seasonal depending on the volume of the zeolite and the area of the solar thermal panels When heat is called for during the night or sunless hours or winter humidified air flows through the zeolite As the humidity is adsorbed by the zeolite heat is released to the air and subsequently to the building space This form of TES with specific use of zeolites was first taught by Guerra in Advantages over molten salts and other high temperature TES include that the temperature required is only the stagnation temperature typical of a solar flat plate thermal collector and as long as the zeolite is kept dry the energy is stored indefinitely Because of the low temperature and because the energy is stored as latent heat of adsorption thus eliminating the insulation requirements of a molten salt storage system costs are significantly lower Disadvantages of solar heating and storage include their lower energy density compared to other thermal energy systems and also how relatively slow the energy transfer process is in the system known as the absorption bed In addition in order to keep maximum performance up the system requires tedious maintenance of the controls These controls manage factors such as humidity temperature and airflow which can alter operating conditions Salt hydrate technology edit One example of an experimental storage system based on chemical reaction energy is the salt hydrate technology The system uses the reaction energy created when salts are hydrated or dehydrated It works by storing heat in a container containing sodium hydroxide NaOH solution Heat e g from using a solar collector is stored by evaporating the water in an endothermic reaction When water is added again heat is released in an exothermic reaction at C F Current systems operate at efficiency The system is especially advantageous for seasonal thermal energy storage because the dried salt can be stored at room temperature for prolonged times without energy loss The containers with the dehydrated salt can even be transported to a different location The system has a higher energy density than heat stored in water and the capacity of the system can be designed to store energy from a few months to years In the Dutch technology developer TNO presented the results of the MERITS project to store heat in a salt container The heat which can be derived from a solar collector on a rooftop expels the water contained in the salt When the water is added again the heat is released with almost no energy losses A container with a few cubic meters of salt could store enough of this thermochemical energy to heat a house throughout the winter In a temperate climate like that of the Netherlands an average low-energy household requires about GJ winter To store this energy in water at a temperature difference of C m insulated water storage would be needed exceeding the storage abilities of most households Using salt hydrate technology with a storage density of about GJ m m could be sufficient As of researchers in several countries are conducting experiments to determine the best type of salt or salt mixture Low pressure within the container seems favorable for the energy transport Especially promising are organic salts so called ionic liquids Compared to lithium halide-based sorbents they are less problematic in terms of limited global resources and compared to most other halides and sodium hydroxide NaOH they are less corrosive and not negatively affected by CO contaminations Even though salts have several benefits salt hydrate technology also has many downsides This is because even though the use of organic salts and ionic liquids show potential in long term stability and cost effectiveness in large scale applications the corrosive nature of the salts used like potassium chloride demand the use of specific and costly corrosion resistant materials Salts also crystallize during the hydration and dehydration phases which reduces their reactivity and eventually the entire system this is yet another disadvantage of theirs This technology is still undergoing further evaluation in order to be used more widely Molecular bonds edit Storing energy in molecular bonds is being investigated Energy densities equivalent to lithium-ion batteries have been achieved This has been done by a DSPEC dys-sensitized photoelectrosythesis cell This is a cell that can store energy that has been acquired by solar panels during the day for night-time or even later use It is designed by taking an indication from well known natural photosynthesis The DSPEC generates hydrogen fuel by making use of the acquired solar energy to split water molecules into its elements As the result of this split the hydrogen is isolated and the oxygen is released into the air This sounds easier than it actually is Four electrons of the water molecules need to be separated and transported elsewhere Another difficult part is the process of merging the two separate hydrogen molecules The DSPEC consists of two components a molecule and a nanoparticle The molecule is called a chromophore-catalyst assembly which absorbs sunlight and kick starts the catalyst This catalyst separates the electrons and the water molecules The nanoparticles are assembled into a thin layer and a single nanoparticle has many chromophore-catalyst on it The function of this thin layer of nanoparticles is to transfer away the electrons which are separated from the water This thin layer of nanoparticles is coated by a layer of titanium dioxide With this coating the electrons that come free can be transferred more quickly so that hydrogen could be made This coating is again coated with a protective coating that strengthens the connection between the chromophore-catalyst and the nanoparticle Using this method the solar energy acquired from the solar panels is converted into fuel hydrogen without releasing the so-called greenhouse gasses This fuel can be stored into a fuel cell and at a later time used to generate electricity Molecular Solar Thermal System MOST edit Another promising way to store solar energy for electricity and heat production is a so-called molecular solar thermal system MOST With this approach a molecule is converted by photoisomerization into a higher-energy isomer Photoisomerization is a process in which one cis trans isomer is converted into another by light solar energy This isomer is capable of storing the solar energy until the energy is released by a heat trigger or catalyst then the isomer is converted into its original isomer A promising candidate for such a MOST is Norbornadiene NBD This is because there is a high energy difference between the NBD and the quadricyclane QC photoisomer This energy difference is approximately kJ mol It is also known that for such systems the donor-acceptor substitutions provide an effective means for red shifting the longest-wavelength absorption This improves the solar spectrum match A crucial challenge for a useful MOST system is to acquire a satisfactory high energy storage density if possible higher than kJ kg Another challenge of a MOST system is that light can be harvested in the visible region The functionalization of the NBD with the donor and acceptor units is used to adjust this absorption maxima However this positive effect on the solar absorption is compensated by a higher molecular weight This implies a lower energy density This positive effect on the solar absorption has another downside Namely that the energy storage time is lowered when the absorption is redshifted A possible solution to overcome this anti-correlation between the energy density and the red shifting is to couple one chromophore unit to several photo switches In this case it is advantageous to form so called dimers or trimers The NBD share a common donor or acceptor Kasper Moth-Poulsen and his team tried to engineer the stability of the high energy photo isomer by having two electronically coupled photo switches with separate barriers for thermal conversion By doing so a blue shift occurred after the first isomerization NBD-NBD to QC-NBD This led to a higher energy of isomerization of the second switching event QC-NBD to QC-QC Another advantage of this system by sharing a donor is that the molecular weight per norbornadiene unit is reduced This leads to an increase of the energy density Eventually this system could reach a quantum yield of photoconversion up per NBD unit A quantum yield is a measure of the efficiency of photon emission With this system the measured energy densities reached up to kJ kg exceeding the target of kJ kg So the potential of the molecular photo switches is enormous not only for solar thermal energy storage but for other applications as well In researchers reported combining the MOST with a chip-sized thermoelectric generator to generate electricity from it The system can reportedly store solar energy for up to years and may be an option for renewable energy storage Thermal battery edit A thermal energy battery is a physical structure used for the purpose of storing and releasing thermal energy Such a thermal battery a k a TBat allows energy available at one time to be temporarily stored and then released at another time The basic principles involved in a thermal battery occur at the atomic level of matter with energy being added to or taken from either a solid mass or a liquid volume which causes the substance s temperature to change Some thermal batteries also involve causing a substance to transition thermally through a phase transition which causes even more energy to be stored and released due to the delta enthalpy of fusion or delta enthalpy of vaporization Thermal batteries are very common and include such familiar items as a hot water bottle Early examples of thermal batteries include stone and mud cooking stoves rocks placed in fires and kilns While stoves and kilns are ovens they are also thermal storage systems that depend on heat being retained for an extended period of time Thermal energy storage systems can also be installed in domestic situations with heat batteries and thermal stores being amongst the most common types of energy storage systems installed at homes in the UK Types of thermal batteries edit Thermal batteries generally fall into categories with different forms and applications although fundamentally all are for the storage and retrieval of thermal energy They also differ in method and density of heat storage citation needed Phase change thermal battery edit Phase change materials used for thermal storage are capable of storing and releasing significant thermal capacity at the temperature that they change phase These materials are chosen based on specific applications because there is a wide range of temperatures that may be useful in different applications and a wide range of materials that change phase at different temperatures These materials include salts and waxes that are specifically engineered for the applications they serve In addition to manufactured materials water is a phase change material The latent heat of water is joules gram The phase change of water occurs at C F Some applications use the thermal capacity of water or ice as cold storage others use it as heat storage It can serve either application ice can be melted to store heat then refrozen to warm an environment The advantage of using a phase change in this way is that a given mass of material can absorb a large quantity of energy without its temperature changing Hence a thermal battery that uses a phase change can be made lighter or more energy can be put into it without raising the internal temperature unacceptably citation needed Common limitations that phase change batteries tend to have are their low thermal conductivity which limits the rate of heat charging and discharging However the most recent advances in this technology is that these batteries have been altered to focus on improving their energy density abilities and cycle stability in order to improve their applications This is being done by integrating phase change materials into the supporting structures of the batteries system Phase change thermal batteries represent a promising and adaptable technology for efficient thermal energy management in multiple uses Encapsulated thermal battery edit An encapsulated thermal battery is physically similar to a phase change thermal battery in that it is a confined amount of physical material which is thermally heated or cooled to store or extract energy However in a non-phase change encapsulated thermal battery the temperature of the substance is changed without inducing a phase change Since a phase change is not needed many more materials are available for use in an encapsulated thermal battery One of the key properties of an encapsulated thermal battery is its volumetric heat capacity VHC also termed volume-specific heat capacity Several substances are used for these thermal batteries for example water concrete and wet or dry sand An example of an encapsulated thermal battery is a residential water heater with a storage tank This thermal battery is usually slowly charged over a period of about minutes for rapid use when needed e g minutes Many utilities understanding the thermal battery nature of water heaters have begun using them to absorb excess renewable energy power when available for later use by the homeowner According to the above-cited article net savings to the electricity system as a whole could be per year per heater some of which may be passed on to its owner A district heating storage using sand or stone operates in Pornainen in Finland where a MW MWh heat storage using tons of soapstone waste is charged by surplus electricity and can serve the area s heating demand for a week It follows research with a prototype MW MWh sand battery that was built in to store renewable solar and wind power as heat for later use as district heating and possible later power generation In Canada single building thermal storage also stores renewable solar and wind power as heat for later use as space or water heating for the building in which it is installed It differs from the system in Finland by being compact using low pressure pumped fluids and can only heat one building rather than several It can take in waste heat from alternate sources such as computer server rooms or compost heaps and store it for later distribution Ground heat exchange thermal battery edit Main article Ground-coupled heat exchanger Thermal battery Component type Energy Working principle Thermodynamics Inventor Heat pumps as used by the GHEX depicted above were invented in the s by Robert C Webber First produced Heat pumps were first produced in the s A ground heat exchanger GHEX is an area of the earth that is utilized as a seasonal annual cycle thermal battery These thermal batteries are areas of the earth into which pipes have been placed in order to transfer thermal energy Energy is added to the GHEX by running a higher temperature fluid through the pipes and thus raising the temperature of the local earth Energy can also be taken from the GHEX by running a lower-temperature fluid through those same pipes GHEX are usually implemented in two forms The picture above depicts what is known as a horizontal GHEX where trenching is used to place an amount of pipe in a closed loop in the ground They are also formed by drilling boreholes into the ground either vertically or horizontally and then the pipes are inserted in the form of a closed-loop with a u-bend fitting on the far end of the loop Heat energy can be added to or removed from a GHEX at any point in time However they are most often used as a Seasonal thermal energy storage operating on an annual cycle where energy is extracted from a building during the summer season to cool a building and added to the GHEX Then that same energy is later extracted from the GHEX in the winter season to heat the building This annual cycle of energy addition and subtraction is highly predictable based on energy modelling of the building served A thermal battery used in this mode is a renewable energy source as the energy extracted in the winter will be restored to the GHEX the next summer in a continually repeating cycle This type is solar powered because it is the heat from the sun in the summer that is removed from a building and stored in the ground for use in the next winter season for heating There are two main methods of Thermal Response Testing that are used to characterize the thermal conductivity and Thermal Capacity Diffusivity of GHEX Thermal Batteries Log-Time -Dimensional Curve Fit and newly released Advanced Thermal Response Testing A good example of the Annual Cycle nature of a GHEX Thermal Battery can be seen in the ASHRAE Building study As seen there in the Ground Loop and Ambient Air temperatures by date graphic Figure one can easily see the annual cycle sinusoidal shape of the ground temperature as heat is seasonally extracted from the ground in winter and rejected to the ground in summer creating a ground thermal charge in one season that is not uncharged and driven the other direction from neutral until a later season Other more advanced examples of Ground-based Thermal Batteries utilizing intentional well-bore thermal patterns are currently in research and early use citation needed Molten-salt batteries edit Main article Molten-salt battery In the defense industry primary molten-salt batteries are termed thermal batteries They are non-rechargeable electrical batteries using a low-melting eutectic mixture of ionic metal salts sodium potassium and lithium chlorides bromides etc as the electrolyte manufactured with the salts in solid form As long as the salts remain solid the battery has a long shelf life of up to years Once activated usually by a pyrotechnic heat source and the electrolyte melts it is very reliable with a high energy and power density They are extensively used for military applications such as small to large guided missiles and nuclear weapons citation needed Other thermal batteries edit There are other items that have historically been termed thermal batteries such as energy-storage heat packs that skiers use for keeping hands and feet warm see hand warmer These contain iron powder moist with oxygen-free salt water which rapidly corrodes over a period of hours releasing heat when exposed to air Instant cold packs absorb heat by a non-chemical phase-change such as by absorbing the endothermic heat of solution of certain compounds The one common principle of these other thermal batteries is that the reaction involved is not reversible Thus these batteries are not used for storing and retrieving heat energy Electric thermal storage edit Main article Storage heater Storage heaters are commonplace in European homes with time-of-use metering traditionally using cheaper electricity at nighttime They consist of high-density ceramic bricks or feolite blocks heated to a high temperature with electricity and may or may not have good insulation and controls to release heat over a number of hours Some advice not to use them in areas with young children or where there is an increased risk of fires due to poor housekeeping both due to the high temperatures involved With the rise of wind and solar power and other renewable energies providing an ever increasing share of energy input into the electricity grids in some countries the use of larger scale electric energy storage is being explored by several commercial companies Ideally the utilisation of surplus renewable energy is transformed into high temperature high grade heat in highly insulated heat stores for release later when needed An emerging technology is the use of vacuum super insulated VSI heat stores The use of electricity to generate heat and not say direct heat from solar thermal collectors means that very high temperatures can be realised potentially allowing for inter seasonal heat transfer storing high grade heat in summer from surplus photovoltaics generation into heat stored for the following winter with relatively minimal standing losses Solar energy storage edit Main articles Solar hot water storage tank and Seasonal thermal energy storage Solar energy is an application of thermal energy storage Most practical solar thermal storage systems provide storage from a few hours to a day s worth of energy However a growing number of facilities use seasonal thermal energy storage STES enabling solar energy to be stored in summer to heat space during winter In Drake Landing Solar Community in Alberta Canada achieved a year-round solar heating fraction a world record made possible by incorporating STES The combined use of latent heat and sensible heat are possible with high temperature solar thermal input Various eutectic metal mixtures such as aluminum and silicon AlSi offer a high melting point suited to efficient steam generation while high alumina cement-based materials offer good storage capabilities Pumped-heat electricity storage edit In pumped-heat electricity storage PHES a reversible heat-pump system is used to store energy as a temperature difference between two heat stores Isentropic edit Isentropic systems involve two insulated containers filled for example with crushed rock or gravel a hot vessel storing thermal energy at high temperature pressure and a cold vessel storing thermal energy at low temperature pressure The vessels are connected at top and bottom by pipes and the whole system is filled with an inert gas such as argon While charging the system can use off-peak electricity to work as a heat pump One prototype used argon at ambient temperature and pressure from the top of the cold store is compressed adiabatically to a pressure of for example bar heating it to around C F The compressed gas is transferred to the top of the hot vessel where it percolates down through the gravel transferring heat to the rock and cooling to ambient temperature The cooled but still pressurized gas emerging at the bottom of the vessel is then adiabatically expanded to bar which lowers its temperature to C The cold gas is then passed up through the cold vessel where it cools the rock while warming to its initial condition The energy is recovered as electricity by reversing the cycle The hot gas from the hot vessel is expanded to drive a generator and then supplied to the cold store The cooled gas retrieved from the bottom of the cold store is compressed which heats the gas to ambient temperature The gas is then transferred to the bottom of the hot vessel to be reheated The compression and expansion processes are provided by a specially designed reciprocating machine using sliding valves Surplus heat generated by inefficiencies in the process is shed to the environment through heat exchangers during the discharging cycle The developer claimed that a round trip efficiency of was achievable This compares to achievable with pumped hydro energy storage Another proposed system uses turbomachinery and is capable of operating at much higher power levels Use of phase change material

t e Wind power is the use of wind energy to generate useful work Historically wind power was used by sails windmills and windpumps but today it is mostly used to generate electricity This article deals only with wind power for electricity generation Today wind power is generated almost completely using wind turbines generally grouped into wind farms and connected to the electrical grid In wind supplied about TWh of electricity which was over of world electricity With about GW added during mostly in China and the United States global installed wind power capacity exceeded GW countries generated more than a tenth of their electricity from wind power in and wind generation has nearly tripled since To help meet the Paris Agreement goals to limit climate change analysts say it should expand much faster by over of electricity generation per year Wind power is a sustainable renewable energy source and has a much smaller impact on the environment than burning fossil fuels Wind power is variable so it needs energy storage or other dispatchable generation energy sources to attain a reliable supply of electricity Land-based onshore wind farms have a greater visual impact on the landscape than most other power stations per energy produced Wind farms sited offshore have less visual impact and have higher capacity factors although they are generally more expensive Offshore wind power currently has a share of about of new installations Wind power is one of the lowest-cost electricity sources per unit of energy produced In many locations new onshore wind farms are cheaper than new coal or gas plants Regions in the higher northern and southern latitudes have the highest potential for wind power In most regions wind power generation is higher in nighttime and in winter when solar power output is low So combinations of wind and solar power are suitable in many countries Wind energy resources Global map of wind speed at meters on land and around coasts Distribution of wind speed red and energy blue for all of at the Lee Ranch facility in Colorado The histogram shows measured data while the curve is the Rayleigh model distribution for the same average wind speed Global map of wind power density potential Wind is air movement in the Earth s atmosphere In a unit of time say second the volume of air that had passed an area A displaystyle A is A v displaystyle Av If the air density is displaystyle rho the flow rate of this volume of air is M t A v displaystyle tfrac M Delta t rho Av and the power transfer or energy transfer per second is P M t v A v displaystyle P tfrac tfrac M Delta t v tfrac rho Av Wind power is thus proportional to the third power of the wind speed the available power increases eightfold when the wind speed doubles Change of wind speed by a factor of increases the wind power by one order of magnitude multiply by The global wind kinetic energy averaged approximately MJ m over the period from to MJ m in the Northern Hemisphere with MJ m in the Southern Hemisphere The atmosphere acts as a thermal engine absorbing heat at higher temperatures releasing heat at lower temperatures The process is responsible for the production of wind kinetic energy at a rate of W m thus sustaining the circulation of the atmosphere against friction Through wind resource assessment it is possible to estimate wind power potential globally by country or region or for a specific site The Global Wind Atlas provided by the Technical University of Denmark in partnership with the World Bank provides a global assessment of wind power potential Unlike static wind resource atlases which average estimates of wind speed and power density across multiple years tools such as Renewables ninja provide time-varying simulations of wind speed and power output from different wind turbine models at an hourly resolution More detailed site-specific assessments of wind resource potential can be obtained from specialist commercial providers and many of the larger wind developers have in-house modeling capabilities The total amount of economically extractable power available from the wind is considerably more than present human power use from all sources The strength of wind varies and an average value for a given location does not alone indicate the amount of energy a wind turbine could produce there To assess prospective wind power sites a probability distribution function is often fit to the observed wind speed data Different locations will have different wind speed distributions The Weibull model closely mirrors the actual distribution of hourly ten-minute wind speeds at many locations The Weibull factor is often close to and therefore a Rayleigh distribution can be used as a less accurate but simpler model Wind farms Main articles Wind farm and List of onshore wind farms Large onshore wind farms Wind farm Capacity MW Country Refs Gansu Wind Farm China Muppandal Wind Farm India Alta Oak Creek-Mojave United States Jaisalmer Wind Park India A wind farm is a group of wind turbines in the same location A large wind farm may consist of several hundred individual wind turbines distributed over an extended area The land between the turbines may be used for agricultural or other purposes A wind farm may also be located offshore Almost all large wind turbines have the same design a horizontal axis wind turbine having an upwind rotor with blades attached to a nacelle on top of a tall tubular tower In a wind farm individual turbines are interconnected with a medium voltage often kV power collection system and communications network In general a distance of D times the rotor diameter of the wind turbine is set between each turbine in a fully developed wind farm At a substation this medium-voltage electric current is increased in voltage with a transformer for connection to the high voltage electric power transmission system Generator characteristics and stability Most modern turbines use variable speed generators combined with either a partial or full-scale power converter between the turbine generator and the collector system which generally have more desirable properties for grid interconnection and have low voltage ride through -capabilities Modern turbines use either doubly fed electric machines with partial-scale converters or squirrel-cage induction generators or synchronous generators both permanently and electrically excited with full-scale converters Black start is possible and is being further developed for places such as Iowa which generate most of their electricity from wind Transmission system operators will supply a wind farm developer with a grid code to specify the requirements for interconnection to the transmission grid This will include the power factor the constancy of frequency and the dynamic behaviour of the wind farm turbines during a system fault Offshore wind power The world s second full-scale floating wind turbine and first to be installed without the use of heavy-lift vessels WindFloat operating at rated capacity MW approximately km offshore of P voa de Varzim Portugal Offshore windfarms including floating windfarms provide a small but growing fraction of total windfarm power generation Such power generation capacity must grow substantially to help meet the IEA s Net Zero by pathway to combat climate change Main articles Offshore wind power and List of offshore wind farms Offshore wind power is wind farms in large bodies of water usually the sea These installations can use the more frequent and powerful winds that are available in these locations and have less visual impact on the landscape than land-based projects However the construction and maintenance costs are considerably higher As of November the Hornsea Wind Farm in the United Kingdom is the largest offshore wind farm in the world at MW Collection and transmission network Near offshore wind farms may be connected by AC and far offshore by HVDC Wind power resources are not always located near areas with a high population density As transmission lines become longer the losses associated with power transmission increase as modes of losses at lower lengths are exacerbated and new modes of losses are no longer negligible as the length is increased making it harder to transport large loads over large distances When the transmission capacity does not meet the generation capacity wind farms are forced to produce below their full potential or stop running altogether in a process known as curtailment While this leads to potential renewable generation left untapped it prevents possible grid overload or risk to reliable service One of the biggest current challenges to wind power grid integration in some countries is the necessity of developing new transmission lines to carry power from wind farms usually in remote lowly populated areas due to availability of wind to high load locations usually on the coasts where population density is higher Any existing transmission lines in remote locations may not have been designed for the transport of large amounts of energy In particular geographic regions peak wind speeds may not coincide with peak demand for electrical power whether offshore or onshore A possible future option may be to interconnect widely dispersed geographic areas with an HVDC super grid Wind power capacity and production Main articles Wind power by country and Wind power industry In wind supplied over TWh of electricity which was of world electricity Growth trends Renewable energy sources especially solar photovoltaic and wind power are providing an increasing share of power capacity Wind energy generation by region Wind generation by country Number of countries with wind capacities in the gigawatt-scale by year Growing number of wind gigawatt-markets Above -GW mark Above -GW mark Above -GW mark To help meet the Paris Agreement s goals to limit climate change analysts say it should expand much faster than it currently is by over of electricity generation per year Expansion of wind power is being hindered by fossil fuel subsidies The actual amount of electric power that wind can generate is calculated by multiplying the nameplate capacity by the capacity factor which varies according to equipment and location Estimates of the capacity factors for wind installations are in the range of to Capacity factor Since wind speed is not constant a wind farm s annual energy production is never as much as the sum of the generator nameplate ratings multiplied by the total hours in a year The ratio of actual productivity in a year to this theoretical maximum is called the capacity factor Online data is available for some locations and the capacity factor can be calculated from the yearly output Penetration Wind energy penetration is the fraction of energy produced by wind compared with the total generation Wind power s share of worldwide electricity usage in was almost up from in There is no generally accepted maximum level of wind penetration The limit for a particular grid will depend on the existing generating plants pricing mechanisms capacity for energy storage demand management and other factors An interconnected electric power grid will already include reserve generating and transmission capacity to allow for equipment failures This reserve capacity can also serve to compensate for the varying power generation produced by wind stations Studies have indicated that of the total annual electrical energy consumption may be incorporated with minimal difficulty These studies have been for locations with geographically dispersed wind farms some degree of dispatchable energy or hydropower with storage capacity demand management and interconnected to a large grid area enabling the export of electric power when needed Electrical utilities continue to study the effects of large-scale penetration of wind generation on system stability A wind energy penetration figure can be specified for different duration of time but is often quoted annually To generate almost all electricity from wind annually requires substantial interconnection to other systems for example some wind power in Scotland is sent to the rest of the British grid On a monthly weekly daily or hourly basis or less wind might supply as much as or more than of current use with the rest stored exported or curtailed The seasonal industry might then take advantage of high wind and low usage times such as at night when wind output can exceed normal demand Such industry might include the production of silicon aluminum steel or natural gas and hydrogen and using future long-term storage to facilitate energy from variable renewable energy better source needed Homes and businesses can also be programmed to vary electricity demand for example by remotely turning up water heater thermostats Variability Main article Variable renewable energy Further information Grid balancing Wind turbines are typically installed in windy locations In the image wind power generators in Spain near an Osborne bull Roscoe Wind Farm an onshore wind farm in West Texas near Roscoe Wind power is variable and during low wind periods it may need to be replaced by other power sources Transmission networks presently cope with outages of other generation plants and daily changes in electrical demand but the variability of intermittent power sources such as wind power is more frequent than those of conventional power generation plants which when scheduled to be operating may be able to deliver their nameplate capacity around of the time Electric power generated from wind power can be highly variable at several different timescales hourly daily or seasonally Annual variation also exists but is not as significant citation needed Because instantaneous electrical generation and consumption must remain in balance to maintain grid stability this variability can present substantial challenges to incorporating large amounts of wind power into a grid system Intermittency and the non- dispatchable nature of wind energy production can raise costs for regulation incremental operating reserve and at high penetration levels could require an increase in the already existing energy demand management load shedding storage solutions or system interconnection with HVDC cables Fluctuations in load and allowance for the failure of large fossil-fuel generating units require operating reserve capacity which can be increased to compensate for the variability of wind generation Utility-scale batteries are often used to balance hourly and shorter timescale variation but car batteries may gain ground from the mid- s Wind power advocates argue that periods of low wind can be dealt with by simply restarting existing power stations that have been held in readiness or interlinking with HVDC The combination of diversifying variable renewables by type and location forecasting their variation and integrating them with dispatchable renewables flexible fueled generators and demand response can create a power system that has the potential to meet power supply needs reliably Integrating ever-higher levels of renewables is being successfully demonstrated in the real world Seasonal cycle of capacity factors for wind and photovoltaics in Europe under idealized assumptions The figure illustrates the balancing effects of wind and solar energy at the seasonal scale Kaspar et al Solar power tends to be complementary to wind On daily to weekly timescales high-pressure areas tend to bring clear skies and low surface winds whereas low-pressure areas tend to be windier and cloudier On seasonal timescales solar energy peaks in summer whereas in many areas wind energy is lower in summer and higher in winter A Thus the seasonal variation of wind and solar power tend to cancel each other somewhat Wind hybrid power systems are becoming more popular Predictability Main article Wind power forecasting For any particular generator there is an chance that wind output will change less than in an hour and a chance that it will change or more in hours In summer wind power in the United Kingdom fell due to the lowest winds in seventy years In the future smoothing peaks by producing green hydrogen may help when wind has a larger share of generation While the output from a single turbine can vary greatly and rapidly as local wind speeds vary as more turbines are connected over larger and larger areas the average power output becomes less variable and more predictable Weather forecasting permits the electric-power network to be readied for the predictable variations in production that occur It is thought that the most reliable low-carbon electricity systems will include a large share of wind power Energy storage Main article Grid energy storage See also List of energy storage projects Energy from wind sunlight or other renewable energy is converted to potential energy for storage in devices such as electric batteries or higher-elevation water reservoirs The stored potential energy is later converted to electricity that is added to the power grid even when the original energy source is not available Typically conventional hydroelectricity complements wind power very well When the wind is blowing strongly nearby hydroelectric stations can temporarily hold back their water When the wind drops they can provided they have the generation capacity rapidly increase production to compensate This gives a very even overall power supply and virtually no loss of energy and uses no more water Alternatively where a suitable head of water is not available pumped-storage hydroelectricity or other forms of grid energy storage such as compressed air energy storage and thermal energy storage can store energy developed by high-wind periods and release it when needed The type of storage needed depends on the wind penetration level low penetration requires daily storage and high penetration requires both short- and long-term storage as long as a month or more citation needed Stored energy increases the economic value of wind energy since it can be shifted to displace higher-cost generation during peak demand periods The potential revenue from this arbitrage can offset the cost and losses of storage Although pumped-storage power systems are only about efficient and have high installation costs their low running costs and ability to reduce the required electrical base-load can save both fuel and total electrical generation costs Energy payback The energy needed to build a wind farm divided into the total output over its life Energy Return on Energy Invested of wind power varies but averages about Thus the energy payback time is typically around a year Economics Onshore wind cost per kilowatt-hour between and Onshore wind is an inexpensive source of electric power cheaper than coal plants and new gas plants According to BusinessGreen wind turbines reached grid parity the point at which the cost of wind power matches traditional sources in some areas of Europe in the mid- s and in the US around the same time Falling prices continue to drive the Levelized cost down and it has been suggested that it has reached general grid parity in Europe in and will reach the same point in the US around due to an expected reduction in capital costs of about needs update In the CEO of Siemens Gamesa warned that increased demand for low-cost wind turbines combined with high input costs and high costs of steel result in increased pressure on the manufacturers and decreasing profit margins Northern Eurasia Canada some parts of the United States and Patagonia in Argentina are the best areas for onshore wind whereas in other parts of the world solar power or a combination of wind and solar tend to be cheaper Electric power cost and trends A turbine blade convoy passing through Edenfield in the U K Even longer -piece blades are now manufactured and then assembled on-site to reduce difficulties in transportation See also Cost of electricity by source Wind power is capital intensive but has no fuel costs The price of wind power is therefore much more stable than the volatile prices of fossil fuel sources However the estimated average cost per unit of electric power must incorporate the cost of construction of the turbine and transmission facilities borrowed funds return to investors including the cost of risk estimated annual production and other components averaged over the projected useful life of the equipment which may be more than years Energy cost estimates are highly dependent on these assumptions so published cost figures can differ substantially The presence of wind energy even when subsidized can reduce costs for consumers billion yr in Germany by reducing the marginal price and by minimizing the use of expensive peaking power plants The cost has decreased as wind turbine technology has improved There are now longer and lighter wind turbine blades improvements in turbine performance and increased power generation efficiency Also wind project capital expenditure costs and maintenance costs have continued to decline In a Lazard study of unsubsidized electricity said that wind power levelized cost of electricity continues to fall but more slowly than before The study estimated new wind-generated electricity cost from to MWh compared to new gas power from to MWh The median cost of fully deprecated existing coal power was MWh nuclear MWh and gas MWh The study estimated offshore wind at around MWh Compound annual growth rate was per year from to compared to per year from to The value of wind power While the levelised costs of wind power may have reached that of traditional combustion based power technologies the market value of the generated power is also lower due to the merit order effect which implies that electricity market prices are lower in hours with substantial generation of variable renewable energy due to the low marginal costs of this technology The effect has been identified in several European markets For wind power plants exposed to electricity market pricing in markets with high penetration of variable renewable energy sources profitability can be challenged Incentives and community benefits Turbine prices have fallen significantly in recent years due to tougher competitive conditions such as the increased use of energy auctions and the elimination of subsidies in many markets As of subsidies are still often given to offshore wind However they are generally no longer necessary for onshore wind in countries with even a very low carbon price such as China provided there are no competing fossil fuel subsidies Secondary market forces provide incentives for businesses to use wind-generated power even if there is a premium price for the electricity For example socially responsible manufacturers pay utility companies a premium that goes to subsidize and build new wind power infrastructure Companies use wind-generated power and in return they can claim that they are undertaking strong green efforts Wind projects provide local taxes or payments in place of taxes and strengthen the economy of rural communities by providing income to farmers with wind turbines on their land The wind energy sector can also produce jobs during the construction and operating phase Jobs include the manufacturing of wind turbines and the construction process which includes transporting installing and then maintaining the turbines An estimated million people were employed in wind power in Small-scale wind power Main article Small wind turbine Further information Microgeneration A small Quietrevolution QR Gorlov type vertical axis wind turbine on the roof of Bristol Beacon in Bristol England Measuring m in diameter and m high it has a nameplate rating of kW Small-scale wind power is the name given to wind generation systems with the capacity to produce up to kW of electrical power Isolated communities that may otherwise rely on diesel generators may use wind turbines as an alternative Individuals may purchase these systems to reduce or eliminate their dependence on grid electric power for economic reasons or to reduce their carbon footprint Wind turbines have been used for household electric power generation in conjunction with battery storage over many decades in remote areas Examples of small-scale wind power projects in an urban setting can be found in New York City where since several building projects have capped their roofs with Gorlov-type helical wind turbines Although the energy they generate is small compared to the buildings overall consumption they help to reinforce the building s green credentials in ways that showing people your high-tech boiler cannot with some of the projects also receiving the direct support of the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority Grid-connected domestic wind turbines may use grid energy storage thus replacing purchased electric power with locally produced power when available The surplus power produced by domestic microgenerators can in some jurisdictions be fed into the network and sold to the utility company producing a retail credit for the microgenerators owners to offset their energy costs Off-grid system users can either adapt to intermittent power or use batteries photovoltaic or diesel systems to supplement the wind turbine Equipment such as parking meters traffic warning signs street lighting or wireless Internet gateways may be powered by a small wind turbine possibly combined with a photovoltaic system that charges a small battery replacing the need for a connection to the power grid Airborne wind turbines such as kites can be used in places at risk of hurricanes as they can be taken down in advance Impact on environment and landscape Main article Environmental impact of wind power Greenhouse gas emissions per energy source Wind energy is one of the sources with the least greenhouse gas emissions Collisions with wind turbines are a minor source of bird mortality compared to other human causes The environmental impact of electricity generation from wind power is minor when compared to that of fossil fuel power Wind turbines have some of the lowest life-cycle greenhouse-gas emissions of energy sources far less greenhouse gas is emitted than for the average unit of electricity so wind power helps limit climate change Use of engineered wood may allow carbon negative wind power Wind power consumes no fuel and emits no local air pollution unlike fossil fuel power sources Onshore wind farms can have a significant visual impact Due to a very low surface power density and spacing requirements wind farms typically need to be spread over more land than other power stations Their network of turbines access roads transmission lines and substations can result in energy sprawl although land between the turbines and roads can still be used for agriculture Some wind farms are opposed for potentially spoiling protected scenic areas archaeological landscapes and heritage sites A report by the Mountaineering Council of Scotland concluded that wind farms harmed tourism in areas known for natural landscapes and panoramic views Habitat loss and fragmentation are the greatest potential impacts on wildlife of onshore wind farms but the worldwide ecological impact is minimal Thousands of birds and bats including rare species have been killed by wind turbine blades though wind turbines are responsible for far fewer bird deaths than fossil-fueled power stations when climate change effects are included The effects of wind turbines on birds can be mitigated with proper wildlife monitoring Many wind turbine blades are made of fiberglass and have a lifetime of years Blades are hollow some blades are crushed to reduce their volume and then landfilled However as they can take a lot of weight they can be made into long lasting small bridges for walkers or cyclists Blade end-of-life is complicated and blades manufactured in the s are more likely to be designed to be completely recyclable Wind turbines also generate noise At a distance of metres ft this may be around dB which is slightly louder than a refrigerator At km mi they become inaudible There are anecdotal reports of negative health effects on people who live very close to wind turbines Peer-reviewed research has generally not supported these claims Politics Central government Although wind turbines with fixed bases are a mature technology and new installations are generally no longer subsidized floating wind turbines are a relatively new technology so some governments subsidize them for example to use deeper waters Fossil fuel subsidies by some governments are slowing the growth of renewables Permitting of wind farms can take years and some governments are trying to speed up the wind industry says this will help limit climate change and increase energy security sometimes groups such as fishers resist this but governments say that rules protecting biodiversity will still be followed Public opinion Acceptance of wind and solar facilities in one s community is stronger among U S Democrats blue while acceptance of nuclear power plants is stronger among U S Republicans red Surveys of public attitudes across Europe and in many other countries show strong public support for wind power Bakker et al found in their study that residents who did not want turbines built near them suffered significantly more stress than those who benefited economically from wind turbines Although wind power is a popular form of energy generation onshore or near offshore wind farms are sometimes opposed for their impact on the landscape especially scenic areas heritage areas and archaeological landscapes as well as noise and impact on tourism In other cases there is direct community ownership of wind farms The hundreds of thousands of people who have become involved in Germany s small and medium-sized wind farms demonstrate such support there A Harris Poll found strong support for wind power in Germany other European countries and the United States Public support in the United States has decreased from in to in with the Democratic Party supporting the use of wind energy twice as much as the Republican Party President Biden has signed an executive order to begin building large scale wind farms In China Shen et al found that Chinese city-dwellers may be resistant to building wind turbines in urban areas with a surprisingly high proportion of people citing an unfounded fear of radiation as driving their concerns Also the study finds that like their counterparts in OECD countries urban Chinese respondents are sensitive to direct costs and wildlife externalities Distributing relevant information about turbines to the public may alleviate resistance Community See also Community debate about wind farms Wind turbines such as these in Cumbria England have been opposed for a number of reasons including aesthetics by some sectors of the population Many wind power companies work with local communities to reduce environmental and other concerns associated with particular wind farms In other cases there is direct community ownership of wind farm projects Appropriate government consultation planning and approval procedures also help to minimize environmental risks Some may still object to wind farms but many say their concerns should be weighed against the need to address the threats posed by air pollution climate change and the opinions of the broader community In the US wind power projects are reported to boost local tax bases helping to pay for schools roads and hospitals and to revitalize the economies of rural communities by providing steady income to farmers and other landowners In the UK both the National Trust and the Campaign to Protect Rural England have expressed concerns about the effects on the rural landscape caused by inappropriately sited wind turbines and wind farms A panoramic view of the United Kingdom s Whitelee Wind Farm with Lochgoin Reservoir in the foreground Some wind farms have become tourist attractions The Whitelee Wind Farm Visitor Centre has an exhibition room a learning hub a caf with a viewing deck and also a shop It is run by the Glasgow Science Centre In Denmark a loss-of-value scheme gives people the right to claim compensation for loss of value of their property if it is caused by proximity to a wind turbine The loss must be at least of the property s value Despite this general support for the concept of wind power in the public at large local opposition often exists and has delayed or aborted a number of projects As well as concerns about the landscape there are concerns that some installations can produce excessive sound and vibration levels leading to a decrease in property values A study of home sales near wind turbines found no statistical evidence that prices were affected While aesthetic issues are subjective and some find wind farms pleasant and optimistic or symbols of energy independence and local prosperity protest groups are often formed to attempt to block some wind power stations for various reasons Some opposition to wind farms is dismissed as NIMBYism but research carried out in found that there is little evidence to support the belief that residents only object to wind farms because of a Not in my Back Yard attitude Geopolitics Wind

control Rotor hub Typical components of a wind turbine gearbox rotor shaft and brake assembly being lifted into position Wind turbines are devices that convert the wind s kinetic energy into electrical power The result of over a millennium of windmill development and modern engineering today s wind turbines are manufactured in a wide range of horizontal axis and vertical axis types The smallest turbines are used for applications such as battery charging for auxiliary power Slightly larger turbines can be used for making small contributions to a domestic power supply while selling unused power back to the utility supplier via the electrical grid Arrays of large turbines known as wind farms have become an increasingly important source of renewable energy and are used by many countries to reduce their reliance on fossil fuels Wind turbine design is the process of defining the form and specifications of a wind turbine to extract energy from the wind A wind turbine installation consists of the necessary systems needed to capture the wind s energy point the turbine into the wind convert mechanical rotation into electrical power and other systems to start stop and control the turbine In the German physicist Albert Betz showed that for a hypothetical ideal wind-energy extraction machine the fundamental laws of conservation of mass and energy allowed no more than of the kinetic energy of the wind to be captured This Betz limit can be approached in modern turbine designs which may reach to of the theoretical Betz limit The aerodynamics of a wind turbine are not straightforward The airflow at the blades is not the same as the airflow far away from the turbine The very nature of how energy is extracted from the air also causes air to be deflected by the turbine This affects the objects or other turbines downstream which is known as wake effect Also the aerodynamics of a wind turbine at the rotor surface exhibit phenomena that are rarely seen in other aerodynamic fields The shape and dimensions of the blades of the wind turbine are determined by the aerodynamic performance required to efficiently extract energy from the wind and by the strength required to resist the forces on the blade In addition to the aerodynamic design of the blades the design of a complete wind power system must also address the design of the installation s rotor hub nacelle tower structure generator controls and foundation History Main article History of wind power Charles F Brush s wind turbine of used for generating electric power See also Renewable energy commercialization Wind power Wind power has been used as long as humans have put sails into the wind Wind-powered machines used to grind grain and pump water the windmill and wind pump were developed in what is now Iran Afghanistan and Pakistan by the th century Wind power was widely available and not confined to the banks of fast-flowing streams or later requiring sources of fuel Wind-powered pumps drained the polders of the Netherlands and in arid regions such as the American mid-west or the Australian outback wind pumps provided water for livestock and steam engines The first wind turbine used for the production of electric power was built in Scotland in July by Prof James Blyth of Anderson s College Glasgow the precursor of Strathclyde University Blyth s metres ft high cloth-sailed wind turbine was installed in the garden of his holiday cottage at Marykirk in Kincardineshire and was used to charge accumulators developed by the Frenchman Camille Alphonse Faure to power the lighting in the cottage thus making it the first house in the world to have its electric power supplied by wind power Blyth offered the surplus electric power to the people of Marykirk for lighting the main street however they turned down the offer as they thought electric power was the work of the devil Although he later built a wind turbine to supply emergency power to the local Lunatic Asylum Infirmary and Dispensary of Montrose the invention never really caught on as the technology was not considered to be economically viable Across the Atlantic in Cleveland Ohio a larger and heavily engineered machine was designed and constructed in the winter of by Charles F Brush This was built by his engineering company at his home and operated from until The Brush wind turbine had a rotor metres ft in diameter and was mounted on an -metre ft tall tower Although large by today s standards the machine was only rated at kW The connected dynamo was used either to charge a bank of batteries or to operate up to incandescent light bulbs three arc lamps and various motors in Brush s laboratory With the development of electric power wind power found new applications in lighting buildings remote from centrally generated power Throughout the th century parallel paths developed small wind stations suitable for farms or residences From many isolated properties in Australia ran their lighting and electric fans from batteries charged by a Freelite wind-driven generator producing watts of electrical power from as little wind speed as miles per hour km h The oil crisis triggered the investigation in Denmark and the United States that led to larger utility-scale wind generators that could be connected to electric power grids for remote use of power By the U S installed capacity had reached gigawatts and by the installed capacity was gigawatts Today wind-powered generators operate in every size range from tiny stations for battery charging at isolated residences up to gigawatt-sized offshore wind farms that provide electric power to national electrical networks The European Union is working to augment these prospects In the global wind power sector experienced significant growth with gigawatts GW of new capacity added to the power grid representing a increase over the amount added in This surge in capacity brought the total installed wind power

Annual generation TWh PJ The Three Gorges Dam a officially known as Yangtze River Three Gorges Water Conservancy Project b is a hydroelectric gravity dam that spans the Yangtze River near Sandouping in Yiling District Yichang Hubei province central China downstream of the Three Gorges The world s largest power station by installed capacity MW the Three Gorges Dam generates TWh of electricity per year on average depending on the amount of precipitation in the river basin After the monsoons of the dam produced nearly TWh in a year breaking the record of TWh set by the Itaipu Dam in The dam s body meters high and meters wide was completed in The power plant became fully operational in when the last of the main water turbines in the underground plant began production The last major component of the project the ship lift was completed in Each of the turbines considered state-of-the-art at the time of their installation can generate MW Combined with two MW generators that power the plant itself the Three Gorges Dam can generate some MW far more than the next-biggest hydroelectric plant Brazil s -MW Itaipu facility The dam improves the Yangtze River s shipping capacity and provides flood control helping to protect millions of people from severe flooding on the Yangtze Plain Additionally its hydroelectric power generation has helped fuel China s economic growth As a result the Chinese government considers the project a source of national pride and a major social and economic success However it is controversial domestically and abroad Estimates of the number of people displaced by the dam s construction range from million to around million Its construction has also inundated ancient and culturally significant sites In operation the dam has caused some ecological changes including an increased risk of landslides Three Gorges Dam Simplified Chinese Traditional Chinese Literal meaning Three Gorges Great Dam Transcriptions Standard Mandarin Hanyu Pinyin S nxi D b Bopomofo IPA sa n ja ta pa other Mandarin Dungan History edit In his poem Swimming engraved on the Flood Memorial in Wuhan Mao Zedong envisions A Great Stone Wall to catch the clouds and rains of Wushan as the fall as A Great lake shall rise upon the gorge Map of the location of the Three Gorges Dam and the most important cities along the Yangtze River Sun Yat-sen envisioned a large dam across the Yangtze River in The International Development of China He wrote that a dam capable of generating million horsepower GW was possible downstream of the Three Gorges In the Nationalist government led by Chiang Kai-shek began preliminary work on plans in the Three Gorges In during the Second Sino-Japanese War Japanese military forces occupied Yichang and surveyed the area In the United States Bureau of Reclamation s head design engineer John L Savage surveyed the area and drew up a dam proposal for a Yangtze River Project Some Chinese engineers went to the US for training The original plans called for the dam to employ a unique method for moving ships the ships would enter locks at the dam s lower and upper ends and then cranes would move them from each lock to the next Groups of craft would be lifted together for efficiency It is not known whether this solution was considered for its water-saving performance or because the engineers thought the difference in height between the river above and below the dam too great for alternative methods No construction work was performed because of the Nationalists worsening situation in the Chinese Civil War After the Communist Revolution Mao Zedong supported the project but began the Gezhouba Dam project nearby first and economic problems including the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution slowed progress After the Yangtze River Floods in Mao wrote Swimming a poem about his fascination with a dam on the Yangtze River In after the Hundred Flowers Campaign some engineers who spoke out against the project were imprisoned During China s emphasis on the Four Modernizations during its early period of Reform and Opening Up The Communist Party revived plans for the dam and proposed to start construction in It emphasized the need to develop hydroelectric power The Chinese People s Political Consultative Conference became a center of opposition to the proposed dam It convened panels of experts who recommended delaying the project The National People s Congress approved the dam in of delegates voted in favour voted against abstained and members did not vote giving the legislation an unusually low approval rate Construction started on December The dam was expected to be fully operational in but additional projects such as the underground power plant with six additional generators delayed full operation until The ship lift was completed in The dam raised the water level in the reservoir to m ft above sea level by and to the designed maximum level of m ft by Composition and dimensions edit Model of the Three Gorges Dam looking upstream showing the dam body middle left the spillway middle of the dam body and the ship lift to the right Model of the Three Gorges Dam showing the ship lift and the ship lock The ship lift is to the right of the dam body with its own designated waterway The ship locks are to the right northeast of the ship lift Earthfill south dam in foreground with view along main dam The wall beyond is to separate spillway and turbine flows from the lock and ship lift upstream approach channel A similar separation is used on the downstream side seen partially in the preceding image Made of concrete and steel the dam is m yd mi long and m ft above sea level at its top The project used million m million cu yd of concrete mainly for the dam wall used tonnes of steel enough to build Eiffel Towers and moved about million m million cu yd of earth The concrete dam wall is m ft high above the rock basis When the water level is at its maximum of m ft above sea level m ft higher than the river level downstream the dam reservoir is on average about km mi in length and km ft in width It contains km acre ft of water and has a total surface area of km sq mi On completion the reservoir flooded a total area of km acres of land compared to the km acres of reservoir created by the Itaipu Dam Economics edit The Chinese government estimated that the Three Gorges Dam project would cost billion yuan US billion By the end of spending had reached billion yuan of which billion yuan was spent on construction billion yuan on relocating affected residents and billion yuan on financing It was estimated in that the cost of construction would be fully recouped when the dam had generated terawatt-hours PJ of electricity yielding billion yuan total cost recovery was thus expected to be completed ten years after the dam became fully operational In fact the entire cost of the Three Gorges Dam was recovered by December independent source needed Funding sources include the Three Gorges Dam Construction Fund profits from the Gezhouba Dam loans from the China Development Bank loans from domestic and foreign commercial banks corporate bonds and revenue from both before and after the dam had become fully operational Additional charges were assessed as follows every province receiving power from the Three Gorges Dam had to pay an extra per MWh and the other provinces had to pay an additional charge of per MWh No surcharge was imposed on the Tibet Autonomous Region Power generation and distribution edit Generating capacity edit Electricity production in China by source Compare The fully completed Three Gorges dam contributes about TWh of generation per year Three Gorges Dam compared to all other Chinese hydroelectricity production Power generation is managed by China Yangtze Power a listed subsidiary of China Three Gorges Corporation CTGC a Central Enterprise administered by SASAC The Three Gorges Dam is the world s largest capacity hydroelectric power station with generators main generators each with a capacity of MW and two plant power generators each with capacity of MW for a total of MW Among the main generators are installed on the dam s north side on the south side and the remaining six in the underground power plant in the mountain south of the dam Annual electricity generation in was TWh which is times more than the Hoover Dam Generators edit The main generators each weigh about tonnes and are designed to produce more than MW of power each The designed hydraulic head of the generators is metres ft The flow rate varies between cubic metres per second cu ft s depending on the head available the greater the head the less water needed to reach full power Three Gorges uses Francis turbines with a diameter of m VGS design Alstom s design and a rotation speed of revolutions per minute This means that in order to generate power at Hz the generator rotors have poles Rated power is MVA with a maximum of MVA and a power factor of The generator produces electrical power at kV The electricity generated is then stepped up to kV for transmission at Hz The generator s stator the biggest of its kind is m in height the outer diameter of the stator is m the inner diameter is m and the bearing load is tonnes Average efficiency is over with a maximum efficiency of reached Francis turbine at Three Gorges Dam The generators were manufactured by two joint ventures Alstom ABB Kvaerner and the Chinese company Harbin Motor and Voith General Electric Siemens abbreviated as VGS and the Chinese company Oriental Motor The technology transfer agreement was signed together with the contract Most of the generators are water-cooled Some of the newer ones are air-cooled making them simpler in design and easier to manufacture and maintain Generator installation progress edit The first north-side main generator No started up on July The north side became completely operational on September with the implementation of generator No Full power MW was eventually achieved on October after the water level reached meters On the south side main generator No started up on June and No became operational on October The sixth No began operation on December raising capacity to GW exceeding that of Itaipu dam GW to become the world s largest hydro power plant by capacity When the last main generator No finished its final test on May the six underground main generators were all operational raising the capacity to GW After nine years of construction installation and testing the power plant was fully operational by July Output milestones edit Annual production of electricity Year Number of installed units TWh Reference Three Gorges Dam annual power output Yangtze River flow rate comparing to the dam intake capacity Three Gorges Dam Installed Units and Annual Electricity Production Over Years By August the plant had generated TWh of electricity In July it generated TWh of electricity its first month over TWh On June after the river flow rate increased to over m s all generators were switched on producing only MW because the head available during flood season is insufficient During an August flood the plant first reached its maximum output for a short period During the November to May dry season power output is limited by the river s flow rate as seen in the diagrams on the right When there is enough flow power output is limited by plant generating capacity The maximum power-output curves were calculated based on the average flow rate at the dam site assuming the water level is m and the plant gross efficiency is The actual power output in was obtained based on the monthly electricity sent to the grid The Three Gorges Dam reached its design-maximum reservoir water level of m ft for the first time on October in which the intended annual power-generation capacity of TWh was realized It has a combined generating capacity of gigawatts and a designed annual generation capacity of TWh In the dam s generating units generated a record TWh of electricity which accounts for of China s total hydro generation Between first year with all generating units operating and the dam generated an average of TWh of electricity per year higher than Itaipu dam s average of TWh of electricity per year during the same period Due to the extensive monsoon season rainfall the annual production reached TWh that year which broke the previous world record of annual production by Itaipu Dam equal to TWh Distribution edit The State Grid Corporation and China Southern Power Grid paid a flat rate of per MWh US until July Since then the price has varied by province from to per MWh Higher-paying customers such as Shanghai receive priority Nine provinces and two cities consume power from the dam Power distribution and transmission infrastructure cost about billion yuan Construction was completed in December one year ahead of schedule Power is distributed over multiple kV transmission lines Three direct current DC lines to the East China Grid carry MW Three Gorges Shanghai MW HVDC Three Gorges Changzhou MW and HVDC Gezhouba Shanghai MW The alternating current AC lines to the Central China Grid have a total capacity of MW The DC transmission line HVDC Three Gorges Guangdong to the South China Grid has a capacity of MW The dam was expected to provide of China s power However electricity demand has increased more quickly than previously projected Even fully operational and despite its size on average it supplies less than of electricity demand in China in the year of when the Chinese electricity demand reached TWh Environmental impact edit Satellite map showing areas flooded by the Three Gorges reservoir Compare November above with April below Flood mark on Yangtze river Emissions edit According to the National Development and Reform Commission grams of coal would produce kWh of electricity during From to power production equaled that of million tonnes of standard coal Erosion and sedimentation edit Two hazards are uniquely identified with the dam that sedimentation projections are not agreed upon and that the dam sits on a seismic fault At current levels of the land in the area is eroding depositing about million tons of sediment into the Yangtze annually Because the flow is slower above the dam much of this sediment settles there instead of flowing downstream and there is less sediment downstream The absence of silt downstream has three effects Some hydrologists expect downstream riverbanks to become more vulnerable to flooding Shanghai more than km mi away rests on a massive sedimentary plain The arriving silt so long as it does arrive strengthens the bed on which Shanghai is built the less the tonnage of arriving sediment the more vulnerable is this biggest of Chinese cities to inundation Benthic sediment buildup causes biological damage and reduces aquatic biodiversity Landslides edit Erosion in the reservoir induced by rising water causes frequent major landslides that have led to noticeable disturbance in the reservoir surface including two incidents in May when somewhere between and cubic metres and cu yd of material plunged into the flooded Wuxia Gorge of the Wu River In the first four months of there were significant landslides Waste management edit Zigui County seat source water protection area in Maoping Town a few kilometres upstream of the dam Collecting garbage at the dam s southeast corner The dam catalyzed improved upstream wastewater treatment around Chongqing and its suburban areas According to the Ministry of Environmental Protection as of April more than new plants could treat million tonnes per day of the total need About landfills were added which could handle tonnes of solid waste every day Over one billion tons of wastewater are released annually into the river which was more likely to be swept away before the reservoir was created This has left the water stagnant polluted and murky Forest cover edit In the Three Gorges area had forestation down from in the s Research by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization suggested that the Asia-Pacific region would gain about km sq mi of forest by That is a significant change from the km sq mi net loss of forest each year in the s This is largely due to China s large reforestation effort This accelerated after the Yangtze River floods convinced the government that it should restore tree cover especially in the Yangtze s basin upstream of the Three Gorges Dam Wildlife edit Concerns about the dam s impact on wildlife predate the National People s Congress s approval in This region has long been known for its rich biodiversity It is home to plant species which belong to families and genera Of these species are endangered These rare species are also used as ingredients in traditional Chinese medicines The proportion of forested area in the region surrounding the Three Gorges Dam dropped from in to less than as of adversely affecting all plant species there The region also provides habitats to hundreds of freshwater and terrestrial animal species Freshwater fish are especially affected by dams due to changes in the water temperature and flow regime Many other fish are injured in the hydroelectric plants turbine blades This is particularly detrimental to the region s ecosystem because the Yangtze River basin is home to different fish species and accounts for of China s endangered freshwater fish species Other aquatic species have been endangered by the dam particularly the baiji or Chinese river dolphin now extinct In fact Chinese Government scholars even claim that the Three Gorges Dam directly caused the extinction of the baiji Of the to remaining critically endangered Siberian crane many spend the winter in wetlands that the Three Gorges Dam will destroy Populations of the Yangtze sturgeon are guaranteed to be negatively affected by the dam In the Chinese paddlefish was declared extinct with the last confirmed sighting in Terrestrial impact edit In NASA scientists calculated that the shift of water mass stored by the dams would increase the total length of the Earth s day by microseconds and make the Earth slightly more round in the middle and flat on the poles A study published in in the journal Open Geosciences suggests that the change of reservoir water level affects the gravity field in western Sichuan which in turn affects the seismicity in that area Floods agriculture industry edit Water level and inflow during the China floods An important function of the dam is to control flooding which is a major problem for the seasonal river of the Yangtze Millions of people live downstream of the dam with many large important cities like Wuhan Nanjing and Shanghai located adjacent to the river Large areas of farmland and China s most important industrial area are situated beside the river The reservoir s flood storage capacity is km cu mi million acre ft This capacity will reduce the frequency of major downstream flooding from once every years to once every years The dam is expected to minimize the effect of even a super flood The river flooded in over an area of km sq mi killing people and forcing almost million people to move The flood waters covered Wuhan a city of eight million people for over three months and the Jingguang Railway was out of service for more than days The flood carried cubic kilometres cu mi of water The dam could only divert the water above Chenglingji leaving to km to cu mi to be diverted The dam cannot protect against some of the large tributaries downstream including the Xiang Zishui Yuanshui Lishui Hanshui and Gan In a flood in the same area caused billions of dollars worth of damage when km sq mi of farmland were flooded The flood affected more than million people killing In early August the largest flood in five years passed through the dam site During this flood the dam limited the water flow to less than m s million cu ft s per second raising the upstream water level from m ft on August to m ft on August A full km cu mi of flood water was captured and the river flow was cut by as much as m cu ft per second The dam discharges its reservoir during the dry season every year between December and March This increases the flow rate of the river downstream providing fresh water for agricultural and industrial usage and improving shipping conditions The water level upstream drops from to m to ft in preparation for the rainy season The water also powers the Gezhouba Dam downstream Since the filling of the reservoir in the Three Gorges Dam has supplied an extra km cu mi of fresh water to downstream cities and farms over the course of the dry season During the South China floods in July inflows at the Three Gorges Dam reached a peak of m s million cu ft s exceeding the peak inflow during the Yangtze River floods The dam s reservoir rose nearly m ft in hours and reduced the outflow to m s million cu ft s in discharges downstream preventing any significant impact on the middle and lower river Navigating the dam edit Locks edit Ship locks for river traffic to bypass the Three Gorges Dam May Construction of TGP ship locks at Yangtze River September The other end of Three Gorges Dam lock Note the bridge in the background The installation of ship locks is intended to increase river shipping from ten million to million tonnes annually as a result transportation costs will be cut between and Shipping will become safer since the gorges are notoriously dangerous to navigate There are two series of ship locks installed near the dam N E N E Each of them is made up of five stages with transit time at around four hours Maximum vessel size is tons The locks are m long m wide and m deep ft That is m ft longer than those on the St Lawrence Seaway but half as deep Before the dam was constructed the maximum freight capacity at the Three Gorges site was million tonnes per year From to a total of million tonnes of freight passed through the locks The freight capacity of the river increased six times and the cost of shipping was reduced by Originally the total capacity of the ship locks was expected to reach million tonnes per year In their cargo turnover reached million tons with an annual increase of over the previous few years These locks are staircase locks whereby inner lock gate pairs serve as both the upper gate of the chamber below and the lower gate of the chamber above The gates are the vulnerable hinged type which if damaged could temporarily render the entire flight unusable As there are separate sets of locks for upstream and downstream traffic this system is more water efficient than bi-directional staircase locks Ship lift edit The ship lift a kind of elevator can lift vessels of up to tonnes in a fraction of the time required to transit the staircase locks In addition to the canal locks there is a ship lift a kind of elevator for vessels The ship lift can lift ships of up to tons The vertical distance traveled is m ft and the size of the ship lift s basin is m m m ft ft ft The ship lift takes to minutes to transit as opposed to the three to four hours for stepping through the locks One complicating factor is that the water level can vary dramatically The ship lift must work even if water levels vary by m ft on the lower side and m ft on the upper side The ship lift s design uses a helical gear system to climb or descend a toothed rack The ship lift was not yet complete when the rest of the project was officially opened on May In November it was reported in the local media that construction of the ship lift started in October In February Xinhua reported that the four towers intended to support the ship lift were nearly complete The report said that by that time the towers had reached m ft of the anticipated m ft As of May the ship lift was expected to be completed by July It was tested in December and announced complete in January Lahmeyer the German firm that designed the ship lift said it will take a vessel less than an hour to transit the lift An article in Steel Construction says the actual time of the lift will be minutes It says that the expected dimensions of the t million kg passenger vessels the ship lift s basin was designed to carry will be by by metres ft ft ft The moving mass including counterweights is tonnes The trials of elevator finished in July the first cargo ship was lifted on July the lift time comprised minutes Shanghai Daily reported that the first operational use of the lift was on September when limited operational testing of the lift began Portage railways edit Plans also exist for the construction of short portage railways bypassing the dam area altogether Two short rail lines one on each side of the river are to be constructed The -kilometre-long mi northern portage railway will run from the Taipingxi port facility on the northern side of the Yangtze just upstream from the dam via Yichang East Railway Station to the Baiyang Tianjiahe port facility in Baiyang Town below Yichang The -kilometre-long mi southern portage railway will run from Maoping upstream of the dam via Yichang South Railway Station to Zhicheng on the Jiaozuo Liuzhou Railway In late preliminary work started along both future railway routes Displacement of residents edit During planning it was estimated that cities towns and villages would be partially or completely flooded by the reservoir amounting to roughly of Hubei s million people and Chongqing Municipality s million people These people were moved to new homes by the Chinese government which considered the displacement justified by the flood protection provided for the communities downstream of the dam Between and Canadian photographer Edward Burtynsky documented the impact of the project on the surrounding areas including the town of Wanzhou Other photographers who recorded the change include Chengdu-based Muge Paris-based Zeng Nian originally from Jiangsu and Israeli Nadav Kander Living conditions deteriorated for many and hundreds of thousands of people could not find work The older generation was particularly affected but younger generations benefited from the educational and career opportunities afforded by moving to large cities with new modern companies and schools Some reports claimed that Chongqing Municipality would encourage four million more people to move away from the dam to Chongqing s main urban area by The municipal government asserted that the relocation was driven by urbanization rather than a direct result of the dam project and that the people involved included other areas of the municipality By June China had moved million residents as far as Gaoyang in Hebei Province and the moves concluded the following month Other effects edit Cultural and history edit The area which would fill with water behind the dam included locations with significant cultural history The State Council authorized a million archaeology salvage effort Over the course of several years archaeologists excavated sites and conducted surface archaeology recovery missions at an additional sites Archaeologists recovered artifacts of which were considered as particularly historically or culturally notable As part of this effort the old Chongqing City Museum was replaced by the Chongqing China Sanxia Museum to house many of the recovered artifacts Recovered structures that were too large for museums were moved upland to reconstruction districts fu jian qu which are outdoor museum parks Recovered structures placed in such parks include temples pavilions houses and bridges among others Some sites could not be moved because of their location size or design such as the hanging coffins site high in the Shen Nong Gorge part of the cliffs National security edit A United States Department of Defense report stated that Since Taipei cannot match Beijing s ability to field offensive systems proponents of strikes against the mainland apparently hope that merely presenting credible threats to China s urban population or high-value targets such as the Three Gorges Dam will deter Chinese military coercion In response the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs criticized the U S report as exhibiting a Cold War mentality harbouring evil intentions The People s Liberation Army Lieutenant General Liu Yuan cautioned that It will not be able to stop war It will have the exact opposite of the desired effect He also remarked that China would be seriously on guard against threats from Taiwan independence terrorists Sung Chao-wen a senior advisory committee member of the Taiwanese Ministry of Defense dismissed online comments about targeting the Three Gorges Dam with missiles as ridiculous saying that the dam s high-strength reinforced concrete could withstand a small nuclear weapon any missile attack would have to penetrate multiple layers of ground and air defenses and missiles would cause only minimal damage if they reached the dam at all Zhang Boting deputy secretary-general of the China Society for Hydropower Engineering said that the Three Gorges Dam was designed as a concrete gravity dam and would therefore be resistant to nuclear attacks Debate among Chinese scholars and analysts about the basic principles of China s no first use NFU of nuclear weapons policy includes questions about whether to add narrow exceptions such as acts that produce catastrophic consequences equivalent to that of a nuclear attack including attacks intended to destroy the Three Gorges Dam Nonetheless supporters of the NFU policy maintain that foreign conventional attacks of such targets including the dam with the intent to cause mass civilian casualties and economic losses are highly improbable Structural integrity edit Immediately after the reservoir was first filled around hairline cracks were observed in the dam s structure Still an experts group gave the project overall a good-quality rating The concrete units all passed quality testing with normal deformation within design limits Upstream dams edit Longitudinal profile of upstream Yangtze River In order to maximize the utility of the Three Gorges Dam and cut down on sedimentation from the Jinsha River the upper course of the Yangtze River authorities are building a series of dams on the Jinsha including the now completed Wudongde Baihetan Xiluodu and Xiangjiaba dams The total capacity of those four dams is MW almost double the capacity of the Three Gorges Baihetan became fully operational in Wudongde was opened in June Another eight dams are

third-longest river in the world It rises at Jari Hill in the Tanggula Mountains of the Tibetan Plateau and flows km mi including the Dam Qu River the longest source of the Yangtze in a generally easterly direction to the East China Sea It is the fifth-largest primary river by discharge volume in the world Its drainage basin comprises one-fifth of the land area of China and is home to nearly one-third of the country s population The Yangtze has played a major role in the history culture and economy of China For thousands of years the river has been used for water irrigation sanitation transportation industry boundary-marking and war The Yangtze Delta generates as much as of China s GDP and the Three Gorges Dam on the Yangtze is the largest hydro-electric power station in the world In mid- the Chinese government announced it was building a multi-tier transport network comprising railways roads and airports to create a new economic belt alongside the river The Yangtze flows through a wide array of ecosystems and is habitat to several endemic and threatened species including the Chinese alligator the narrow-ridged finless porpoise and also was the home of the now extinct Yangtze river dolphin or baiji and Chinese paddlefish as well as the Yangtze sturgeon which is extinct in the wild In recent years the river has suffered from industrial pollution plastic pollution agricultural runoff siltation and loss of wetland and lakes which exacerbates seasonal flooding Some sections of the river are now protected as nature reserves A stretch of the upstream Yangtze flowing through deep gorges in western Yunnan is part of the Three Parallel Rivers of Yunnan Protected Areas a UNESCO World Heritage Site Etymology edit Chinese edit Ch ng Ji ng meaning Long River is the name for the river in Chinese However the Chinese have given different names to sections of the river it is from an ancient name to only a part of the river that the modern English name derives see below In Old Chinese the Yangtze was simply called Jiang Kiang a character of phono-semantic compound origin combining the water radical with the homophone now pronounced g ng but k o in Old Chinese Kong was probably a word in the Austroasiatic language of local peoples such as the Yue Similar to krong in Proto-Vietnamese and krung in Mon all meaning river it is related to modern Vietnamese s ng river and Khmer krung city on riverside whence Thai krung capital city not k ngkea water which is from the Sanskrit root g g The Great River with its entrance to the East China Sea marked as the Mouth of the Yangtze on the Jiangnan map in the Provincial Atlas of the Qing Empire By the Han dynasty Ji ng had come to mean any river in Chinese and this river was distinguished as the Great River D ji ng The epithet simplified version meaning long was first formally applied to the river during the Six Dynasties period citation needed Various sections of the Yangtze have local names From Yibin to Yichang the river through Sichuan and Chongqing Municipality is also known as the Chu n Ji ng or Sichuan River In Hubei the river is also called the J ng Ji ng or the Jing River after Jingzhou one of the Nine Provinces of ancient China In Anhui the river takes on the local name W n Ji ng after the shorthand name for Anhui w n Jinsha Gold Sands River refers to the km mi of the Yangtze from Yibin upstream to the confluence with the Batang River near Yushu in Qinghai while the Tongtian Leading to Heaven River describes the km mi section from Yushu up to the confluence of the Tuotuo River and the Dangqu River citation needed Y ngz Ji ng or the Yangzi River from which the English name Yangtze is derived is the local name for the Lower Yangtze in the region of Yangzhou The name likely comes from an ancient ferry crossing called Y ngz or Y ngz j n Europeans who arrived in the Yangtze River Delta region applied this local name to the whole river English edit In the West the river was called Quian and Quianshui by Marco Polo and appeared on the earliest English maps as Kian or Kiam By the mid- th century these romanizations had standardized as Kiang A related form also popularized in English was Kian-ku also spelled Keeang-Koo and Kyang Kew derived from mistaking the Chinese term for the mouth of the Yangtze Ji ngk u as the name of the river itself The name Blue River began to be applied in the th century apparently owing to a former name of the Dam Chu or Min and to analogy with the Yellow River but it was frequently explained in early English references as a translation of Jiang Jiangkou or Yangzijiang Very common in th- and th-century sources the name fell out of favor due to growing awareness of its lack of any connection to the river s Chinese names and to the irony of its application to such a muddy waterway Matteo Ricci s Latin account included descriptions of the Ian u and Ian uchian The posthumous account s translation of the name as Fils de la Mer Son of the Ocean shows that Ricci who by the end of his life was fluent in literary Chinese was introduced to it as the homophonic rather than the usual Further although railroads and the Shanghai concessions subsequently turned it into a backwater Yangzhou was the lower river s principal port for much of the Qing dynasty directing Liangjiang s important salt monopoly and connecting the Yangtze with the Grand Canal to Beijing That connection also made it one of the Yellow River s principal ports between the floods of and the s during which time the Yellow River ran well south of Shandong and discharged into the ocean a mere few hundred kilometers from the mouth of the Yangtze Y ngz Ji ng or the Yangzi River from which the English name Yangtze is derived is the local name for the Lower Yangtze in the region of Yangzhou see above Europeans who arrived in the Yangtze River Delta region applied this local name to the whole river By English cartographers such as Aaron Arrowsmith had adopted the French style of the name as Yang-tse or Yang-tse Kiang The British diplomat Thomas Wade emended this to Yang-tzu Chiang as part of his formerly popular romanization of Chinese based on the Beijing dialect instead of Nanjing s and first published in The spellings Yangtze and Yangtze Kiang was a compromise between the two methods adopted at the Imperial Postal Conference in Shanghai which established postal romanization Hanyu Pinyin was adopted by the PRC s First Congress in but it was not widely employed in English outside mainland China prior to the normalization of diplomatic relations between the United States and the PRC in since that time the spelling Yangzi has also been used Tibetan edit The source and upper reaches of the Yangtze are

eastern part of the Tibetan Plateau two of which are commonly referred to as the source Traditionally the Chinese government has recognized the source as the Tuotuo tributary at the base of a glacier lying on the west of Geladandong Mountain in the Tanggula Mountains This source is found at N E N E and while not the furthest source of the Yangtze it is the highest source at m ft above sea level The true source of the Yangtze hydrologically the longest river distance from the sea is at Jari Hill at the head of the Dam Qu tributary approximately km mi southeast of Geladandong This source was only discovered in the late th century and lies in wetlands at N E N E and m ft above sea level just southeast of Chadan Township in Zadoi County Yushu Prefecture Qinghai As the historical spiritual source of the Yangtze the Geladandong source is still commonly referred to as the source of the Yangtze since the discovery of the Jari Hill source These tributaries join and the river then runs eastward through Qinghai Tsinghai turning southward down a deep valley at the border of Sichuan Szechwan and Tibet to reach Yunnan In the course of this valley the river s elevation drops from above m ft to less than m ft Thus over the first km mi of its length the river has fallen more than m ft It enters the basin of Sichuan at Yibin While in the Sichuan basin it receives several large tributaries increasing its water volume significantly It then cuts through Mount Wushan bordering Chongqing and Hubei to create the famous Three Gorges Eastward of the Three Gorges Yichang is the first city on the Yangtze Plain After entering Hubei province the Yangtze receives water from a number of lakes The largest of these lakes is Dongting Lake which is located on the border of Hunan and Hubei provinces and is the outlet for most of the rivers in Hunan At Wuhan it receives its biggest tributary the Han River bringing water from its northern basin as far as Shaanxi At the northern tip of Jiangxi province Lake Poyang the biggest freshwater lake in China merges into the river The river then runs through Anhui and Jiangsu receiving more water from innumerable smaller lakes and rivers and finally reaches the East China Sea at Shanghai Four of China s five main freshwater lakes contribute their waters to the Yangtze River Traditionally the upstream part of the Yangtze River refers to the section from Yibin to Yichang the middle part refers to the section from Yichang to Hukou County where Lake Poyang meets the river the downstream part is from Hukou to Shanghai The origin of the Yangtze River has been dated by some geologists to about million years ago in the Eocene but this dating has been disputed History edit Geologic history edit Although the mouth of the Yellow River has fluctuated widely north and south of the Shandong peninsula within the historical record the Yangtze has remained largely static Based on studies of sedimentation rates however it is unlikely that the present discharge site predates the late Miocene c Ma Prior to this its headwaters drained south into the Gulf of Tonkin along or near the course of the present Red River Afternoon in the jagged mountains rising from the Yangtze River gorge Early history edit Further information Baiyue state of Wu state of Yue state of Chu Yangtze civilization and Southward expansion of the Han Dynasty The Yangtze River is important to the cultural origins of southern China and Japan Human activity has been verified in the Three Gorges area as far back as years ago and by the th millennium BC the lower Yangtze was a major population center occupied by the Hemudu and Majiabang cultures both among the earliest cultivators of rice By the rd millennium BC the successor Liangzhu culture showed evidence of influence from the Longshan peoples of the North China Plain What is now thought of as Chinese culture developed along the more fertile Yellow River basin the Yue people of the lower Yangtze possessed very different traditions blackening their teeth cutting their hair short tattooing their bodies and living in small settlements among bamboo groves and were considered barbarous by the northerners The Central Yangtze valley was home to sophisticated Neolithic cultures Later it became the earliest part of the Yangtze valley to be integrated into the North Chinese cultural sphere Northern Chinese were active there since the Bronze Age A map of the Warring States around BC showing the former coastline of the Yangtze delta In the lower Yangtze two Yue tribes the Gouwu in southern Jiangsu and the Yuyue in northern Zhejiang display increasing Zhou i e North Chinese influence starting in the th century BC Traditional accounts credit these changes to northern refugees Taibo and Zhongyong in Wu and Wuyi in Yue who assumed power over the local tribes though these are generally assumed to be myths invented to legitimate them to other Zhou rulers As the kingdoms of Wu and Yue they were famed as fishers shipwrights and sword-smiths Adopting Chinese characters political institutions and military technology they were among the most powerful states during the later Zhou In the middle Yangtze the state of Jing seems to have begun in the upper Han River valley a minor Zhou polity but it adapted to native culture as it expanded south and east into the Yangtze valley In the process it changed its name to Chu Whether native or nativizing the Yangtze states held their own against the northern Chinese homeland some lists credit them with three of the Spring and Autumn period s Five Hegemons and one of the Warring States Four Lords They fell in against themselves however Chu s growing power led its rival Jin to support Wu as a counter Wu successfully sacked Chu s capital Ying in BC but Chu subsequently supported Yue in its attacks against Wu s southern flank In BC King Goujian of Yue fully annexed Wu and moved his court to its eponymous capital at modern Suzhou In BC Chu finally united the lower Yangtze by annexing Yue whose royal family was said to have fled south and established the Minyue kingdom in Fujian Qin was able to unite China by first subduing Ba and Shu on the upper Yangtze in modern Sichuan giving them a strong base to attack Chu s settlements along the river The state of Qin conquered the central Yangtze region the previous heartland of Chu in BC and incorporated the region into its expanding empire Qin then used its connections along the Xiang River to expand into Hunan Jiangxi and Guangdong setting up military commanderies along the main lines of communication At the collapse of the Qin Dynasty these southern commanderies became the independent Nanyue Empire under Zhao Tuo while Chu and Han vied with each other for control of the north Since the Han dynasty the region of the Yangtze River grew ever more important to China s economy The establishment of irrigation systems the most famous one is Dujiangyan northwest of Chengdu built during the Warring States period made agriculture very stable and productive eventually exceeding even the Yellow River region The Qin and Han empires were actively engaged in the agricultural colonization of the Yangtze lowlands maintaining a system of dikes to protect farmland from seasonal floods By the Song dynasty the area along the Yangtze had become among the wealthiest and most developed parts of the country especially in the lower reaches of the river Early in the Qing dynasty the region called Jiangnan that includes the southern part of Jiangsu the northern part of Zhejiang and Jiangxi and the southeastern part of Anhui provided of the nation s revenues The Yangtze has long been the backbone of China s inland water transportation system which remained particularly important for almost two thousand years until the construction of the national railway network during the th century The Grand Canal connects the lower Yangtze with the major cities of the Jiangnan region south of the river Wuxi Suzhou Hangzhou and with northern China all the way from Yangzhou to Beijing The less well known ancient Lingqu Canal connecting the upper Xiang River with the headwaters of the Guijiang allowed a direct water connection from the Yangtze Basin to the Pearl River Delta Historically the Yangtze was the political boundary between north China and south China several times see History of China because crossing the river was difficult This occurred notably during the Southern and Northern Dynasties and the Southern Song Many battles took place along the river the most famous being the Battle of Red Cliffs in AD during the Three Kingdoms period The Yangtze was the site of naval battles between the Song dynasty and Jurchen Jin during the Jin Song wars In the Battle of Caishi of the ships of the Jin emperor Wanyan Liang clashed with the Song fleet on the Yangtze Song soldiers fired bombs of lime and sulfur using trebuchets at the Jurchen warships The battle was a Song victory that halted the invasion by the Jin The Battle of Tangdao was another Yangtze naval battle in the same year Politically Nanjing was the capital of China several times although most of the time its territory only covered the southeastern part of China such as the Wu kingdom in the Three Kingdoms period the Eastern Jin Dynasty and during the Southern and Northern Dynasties and Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms periods Only the Ming occupied most parts of China from their capital at Nanjing though it later moved the capital to Beijing The ROC capital was located in Nanjing in the periods and Ten Thousand Miles of the Yangtze River a Ming dynasty landscape painting Age of steam edit Main article China Station The Jardine the first steamship to sail the river was built for the British firm Jardine Matheson Co in This small vessel was to carry passengers and mail between Lintin Island Macao and Huangpu However the Chinese draconian in their application of the rules relating to foreign vessels were unhappy about a fire-ship steaming up the Canton River The acting Viceroy of Liangguang issued an edict warning that she would be fired on if she attempted the trip On the Jardine s first trial run from Lintin Island the forts on both sides of the Bogue opened fire and she was forced to turn back The Chinese authorities issued a further warning insisting that the ship leave Chinese waters The Jardine in any case needed repairs and was sent to Singapore Subsequently Lord Palmerston the Foreign Secretary decided mainly on the suggestions of William Jardine to declare war on China In mid- a large fleet of warships appeared on the China coast and with the first cannonball fired at a British ship the Royal Saxon the British started the first of the Opium Wars Royal Navy warships destroyed numerous shore batteries and Chinese warships laying waste to several coastal forts along the way Eventually they pushed their way up north close enough to threaten the Imperial Palace in Beijing itself The China Navigation Company was an early shipping company founded in in London initially to trade up the Yangtze River from their Shanghai base with passengers and cargo Chinese coastal trade started shortly after and in a regular service to Australia was initiated Yangtze River steam boats filmed in USS Luzon Navigation on the upper river edit Yangtze in Cruise boats on Yangtze A vehicle carrier on Yangtze A container carrier on Yangtze Steamers came late to the upper river the section stretching from Yichang to Chongqing Freshets from Himalayan snowmelt created treacherous seasonal currents But summer was better navigationally and the three gorges described as a -mile passage which is like the narrow throat of an hourglass posed hazardous threats of crosscurrents whirlpools and eddies creating significant challenges to steamship efforts Furthermore Chongqing is feet above sea level requiring powerful engines to make the upriver climb Junk travel accomplished the upriver feat by employing trackers men hitched to hawsers who physically pulled ships upriver through some of the most risky and deadly sections of the three gorges Archibald John Little took an interest in Upper Yangtze navigation when in the Chefoo Convention opened Chongqing to consular residence but stipulated that foreign trade might only commence once steamships had succeeded in ascending the river to that point Little formed the Upper Yangtze Steam Navigation Co Ltd and built Kuling but his attempts to take the vessel further upriver than Yichang were thwarted by the Chinese authorities who were concerned about the potential loss of transit duties competition to their native junk trade and physical damage to their craft caused by steamship wakes Kuling was sold to China Merchants Steam Navigation Company for lower river service In the Chinese government agreed to open Chongqing to foreign trade as long as it was restricted to native craft In the Treaty of Shimonoseki provided a provision which opened Chongqing fully to foreign trade Little took up residence in Chongqing and built Leechuan to tackle the gorges in In March Leechuan completed the upriver journey to Chongqing but not without the assistance of trackers Leechuan was not designed for cargo or passengers and if Little wanted to take his vision one step further he required an expert pilot In Little persuaded Captain Samuel Cornell Plant to come out to China to lend his expertise Captain Plant had just completed navigation of Persia s Upper Karun River and took up Little s offer to assess the Upper Yangtze on Leechuan at the end of With Plant s design input Little had SS Pioneer built with Plant in command In June Plant was the first to successfully pilot a merchant steamer on the Upper Yangtze from Yichang to Chongqing Pioneer was sold to Royal Navy after its first run due to threat from the Boxer Rebellion and renamed HMS Kinsha Germany s steamship effort that same year on SS Suixing ended in catastrophe On Suixing s maiden voyage the vessel hit a rock and sunk killing its captain and ending realistic hopes of regular commercial steam service on the Upper Yangtze In local Sichuan merchants and their government partnered with Captain Plant to form Sichuan Steam Navigation Company becoming the first successful service between Yichang and Chongqing Captain Plant designed and commanded its two ships SS Shutung and SS Shuhun Other Chinese vessels came onto the run and by foreign ships expressed their interest too Plant was appointed by Chinese Maritime Customs Service as First Senior River Inspector in In this role Plant installed navigational marks and established signaling systems He also wrote Handbook for the Guidance of Shipmasters on the Ichang-Chungking Section of the Yangtze River a detailed and illustrated account of the Upper Yangtze s currents rocks and other hazards with navigational instruction Plant trained hundreds of Chinese and foreign pilots and issued licenses and worked with the Chinese government to make the river safer in by removing some of the most difficult obstacles and threats with explosives In August British Asiatic Petroleum became the first foreign merchant steamship on the Upper Yangtze Commercial firms Robert Dollar Company Jardine Matheson Butterfield and Swire and Standard Oil added their own steamers on the river between and Between and Sichuan warlord violence and escalating civil war put Sichuan Steam Navigational Company out of business Shutung was commandeered by warlords and Shuhun was brought down river to Shanghai for safekeeping In when Captain Plant died at sea while returning home to England a Plant Memorial Fund was established to perpetuate Plant s name and contributions to Upper Yangtze navigation The largest shipping companies in service Butterfield Swire Jardine Matheson Standard Oil Mackenzie Co Asiatic Petroleum Robert Dollar China Merchants S N Co and British-American Tobacco Co contributed alongside international friends and Chinese pilots In a -foot granite pyramidal obelisk was erected in Xintan on the site of Captain Plant s home in a Chinese community of pilots and junk owners One face of the monument is inscribed in Chinese and another in English Though recently relocated to higher ground ahead of the Three Gorges Dam the monument still stands overlooking the Upper Yangtze River near Yichang a rare collective tribute to a westerner in China Standard Oil ran the tankers Mei Ping Mei An and Mei Hsia

the Yangtze valley an area that naturally floods every summer and is habitable only because it is protected by river dikes The floods large enough to overflow the dikes have caused great distress to those who live and farm there Floods of note include those of and The Central China floods or the Central China floods of were a series of floods that are generally considered among the deadliest natural disasters ever recorded and almost certainly the deadliest of the th century when pandemics and famines are discounted Estimates of the total death toll range from to between million and million The Yangtze flooded again in causing great loss of life From June to September the Yangtze River Floods were a series of catastrophic floodings that occurred mostly in Hubei Province Due to unusually high volume of precipitation as well as an extraordinarily long rainy season in the middle stretch of the Yangtze River late in the spring of the river started to rise above its usual level in around late June Despite efforts to open three important flood gates to alleviate the rising water by diverting it the flood level continued to rise until it hit the historic high of m in Jingzhou Hubei and m in Wuhan The number of dead from this flood was estimated at including those who died of plague in the aftermath of the disaster The Yangtze River floods were a series of major floods that lasted from middle of June to the beginning of September along the Yangtze In the summer of China experienced massive flooding of parts of the Yangtze River resulting in dead million homeless and billion in economic loss Other sources report a total loss of people and million people were affected A staggering million acres km were evacuated million houses were damaged or destroyed The floods caused billion in damages The China floods caused US billion in damages In the Yangtze river saw the heaviest rainfall since with a increase in June and July compared to the average for the period over the previous years A new theory suggested that abrupt reduction in emissions of greenhouse gases and aerosols caused by shutdowns during the COVID- pandemic was a key cause of the intense downpours Over the past decades rainfall had decreased due to increase of aerosols in the atmosphere and lower greenhouse gas emissions in caused the opposite effect a major increase in rain Such a dramatic reduction of aerosols caused a dramatic change in the various components of the climate system but such sudden change of the climate system would be very different from changes in response to continuous but gradual policy-driven emissions reductions Degradation of the river edit See also Water resources in China Water quality Barges on the river Beginning in the s dams and dikes were built for flood control land reclamation irrigation and control of diseases vectors such as blood flukes that caused Schistosomiasis More than a hundred lakes were thusly cut off from the main river There were gates between the lakes that could be opened during floods However farmers and settlements encroached on the land next to the lakes although it was forbidden to settle there When floods came it proved impossible to open the gates since it would have caused substantial destruction Thus the lakes partially or completely dried up For example Baidang Lake shrunk from square kilometers sq mi in the s to square kilometers sq mi in Zhangdu Lake dwindled to one quarter of its original size Natural fisheries output in the two lakes declined sharply Only a few large lakes such as Poyang Lake and Dongting Lake remained connected to the Yangtze Cutting off the other lakes that had served as natural buffers for floods increased the damage done by floods further downstream Furthermore the natural flow of migratory fish was obstructed and biodiversity across the whole basin decreased dramatically Intensive farming of fish in ponds spread using one type of carp who thrived in eutrophic water conditions and who feeds on algae causing widespread pollution The pollution was exacerbated by the discharge of waste from pig farms as well as of untreated industrial and municipal sewage In September the Yangtze river near Chongqing turned red from pollution The erection of the Three Gorges Dam has created an impassable iron barrier that has led to a great reduction in the biodiversity of the river Yangtze sturgeon use seasonal changes in the flow of the river to signal when is it time to migrate However these seasonal changes will be greatly reduced by dams and diversions Other animals facing immediate threat of extinction are the baiji dolphin narrow-ridged finless porpoise and the Yangtze alligator These animals numbers went into freefall from the combined effects of accidental catches during fishing river traffic habitat loss and pollution In the baiji dolphin became extinct the world lost an entire genus In a sweeping law was passed by the Chinese government to protect the ecology of the river The new laws include strengthening ecological protection rules for hydropower projects along the river banning chemical plants within kilometer of the river relocating polluting industries severely restricting sand mining as well as a complete fishing ban on all the natural waterways of the river including all its major tributaries and lakes Contribution to ocean pollution edit The Yangtze River produces more ocean plastic pollution than any other according to The Ocean Cleanup a Dutch environmental research foundation that focuses on ocean pollution Ten rivers transport of all the plastic that reaches the oceans with the Yangtze River being the biggest polluter Reconnecting lakes edit In a pilot program was initiated to reconnect lakes to the Yangtze with the objective to increase biodiversity and to alleviate flooding The first lakes to be reconnected in were Zhangdu Lake Honghu Lake and Tian e-Zhou in Hubei on the middle Yangtze In Baidang Lake in Anhui was also reconnected Reconnecting the lakes improved water quality and fish were able to migrate from the river into the lake replenishing their numbers and genetic stock The trial also showed that reconnecting the lake reduced flooding The new approach also benefitted the farmers economically Pond farmers switched to natural fish feed which helped them breed better-quality fish that can be sold for more increasing their income by Based on the successful pilot project other provincial governments emulated the experience and also reestablished connections to lakes that had previously been cut off from the river In a Yangtze Forum has been established bringing together riparian provincial governments to manage the river from source to sea In China s Ministry of Agriculture made it a national policy to reconnect the Yangtze River with its lakes As of provincial governments in five provinces and Shanghai set up a network of effective protected areas covering km sq mi As a result populations of threatened species increased including the critically endangered Yangtze alligator In the Shanghai area reestablished wetlands now protect drinking water sources for the city It is envisaged to extend the network throughout the entire Yangtze to eventually cover areas and km sq mi The mayor of Wuhan announced that six huge stagnating urban lakes including the East Lake Wuhan would be reconnected at the cost of US billion creating China s largest urban wetland landscape Discharge edit The Yangtze River is the longest and most economically important river in

October The river stood as a major geographic barrier dividing northern and southern China In the first half of the th century rail passengers from Beijing to Guangzhou and Shanghai had to disembark respectively at Hanyang and Pukou and cross the river by steam ferry before resuming journeys by train from Wuchang or Nanjing West After the founding of the People s Republic in Soviet engineers

Protected areas edit Sanjiangyuan Three Rivers Sources National Nature Reserve in Qinghai Three Parallel Rivers of Yunnan Wildlife edit The Yangtze River has a high species richness including many endemics A high percentage of these are seriously threatened by human activities Fish edit The two sturgeon species in the Yangtze here Chinese sturgeon are both seriously threatened As of update fish species are known from the Yangtze basin including that strictly are freshwater species The remaining are also known from salt or brackish waters such as the river s estuary or the East China Sea This makes it one of the most species-rich rivers in Asia and by far the most species-rich in China in comparison the Pearl River has almost fish species and the Yellow River fish species are endemic to the Yangtze River Basin Many are only found in some section of the river basin and especially the upper reach above Yichang but below the headwaters in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is rich with species including Yangtze endemics and strict endemics found only in this part of the basin In contrast the headwaters where the average altitude is above m ft are only home to highly specialized species but of these are endemic to the river The largest orders in the Yangtze are Cypriniformes species including endemics Siluriformes species including endemics Perciformes species including endemics Tetraodontiformes species including endemic and Osmeriformes species including endemic No other order has more than four species in the river and one endemic Many Yangtze fish species have declined drastically and were recognized as threatened in the Chinese red list Among these are three that are considered entirely extinct Chinese paddlefish Anabarilius liui liui and Atrilinea macrolepis two that are extinct in the wild Anabarilius polylepis Schizothorax parvus four that are critically endangered Euchiloglanis kishinouyei Megalobrama elongata Schizothorax longibarbus and Leiocassis longibarbus Additionally both the Yangtze sturgeon and Chinese sturgeon are considered critically endangered by the IUCN The survival of these two sturgeon may rely on the continued release of captive bred specimens Although still listed as critically endangered rather than extinct by both the Chinese red list and IUCN recent reviews have found that the Chinese paddlefish is extinct Surveys conducted between and by ichthyologists failed to catch any but two probable specimens were recorded with hydroacoustic signals The last definite record was an individual that was accidentally captured near Yibin in and released after having been radio tagged The Chinese sturgeon is the largest fish in the river and among the largest freshwater fish in the world reaching a length of m ft the extinct Chinese paddlefish reputedly reached as much as m ft but its maximum size is labeled with considerable uncertainty The silver carp is native to the river but has like other Asian carp been spread through large parts of the world with aquaculture The largest threats to the Yangtze native fish are overfishing and habitat loss such as building of dams and land reclamation but pollution destructive fishing practices such as fishing with dynamite or poison and introduced species also cause problems About of the total freshwater fisheries in China are in the Yangtze Basin but a drastic decline in size of several important species has been recorded as highlighted by data from lakes in the river basin In some experts recommend a -year fishing moratorium to allow the remaining populations to recover and in January China imposed a -year fishing moratorium on sites along the Yangtze Dams present another serious problem as several species in the river perform breeding migrations and most of these are non-jumpers meaning that normal fish ladders designed for salmon are ineffective For example the Gezhouba Dam blocked the migration of the paddlerfish and two sturgeon while also effectively splitting the Chinese high fin banded shark population into two and causing the extirpation of the Yangtze population of the Japanese eel In an attempt of minimizing the effect of the dams the Three Gorges Dam has released water to mimic the pre-dam natural flooding and trigger the breeding of carp species downstream In addition to dams already built in the Yangtze basin several large dams are planned and these may present further problems for the native fauna While many fish species native to the Yangtze are seriously threatened others have become important in fish farming and introduced widely outside their native range A total of native fish species of the Yangtze basin are farmed Among the most important are four Asian carp grass carp black carp silver carp and bighead carp Other species that support important fisheries include northern snakehead Chinese perch Takifugu pufferfish mainly in the lowermost sections and predatory carp Other animals edit The critically endangered Chinese alligator is one of the smallest crocodilians reaching a maximum length of about m ft Due to commercial use of the river tourism and pollution the Yangtze is home to several seriously threatened species of large animals in addition to fish the narrow-ridged finless porpoise baiji Yangtze river dolphin Chinese alligator Yangtze giant softshell turtle and Chinese giant salamander This is the only other place besides the United States that is native to an alligator and paddlefish species In the Yangtze population of finless porpoise was individuals In December the Yangtze river dolphin was declared functionally extinct after an extensive search of the river revealed no signs of the dolphin s inhabitance In a large white animal was sighted and photographed in the lower Yangtze and was tentatively presumed to be a baiji However as there have been no confirmed sightings since the baiji is presumed to be functionally extinct at this time Baijis were the last surviving species of a large lineage dating back seventy million years and one of only six species of freshwater dolphins It has been argued that the extinction of the Yangtze river dolphin was a result of the completion of the Three Gorges Dam a project that has affected many species of animals and plant life found only in the gorges area Numerous species of land mammals are found in the Yangtze valley but most of these are not directly associated with the river Three exceptions are the semi-aquatic Eurasian otter water deer and P re David s deer The entirely aquatic Chinese giant salamander is the world s largest amphibian reaching up to m ft in length In addition to the very large and exceptionally rare Yangtze giant softshell turtle several smaller turtle species are found in the Yangtze basin its delta and valleys These include the Chinese box turtle yellow-headed box turtle Pan s box turtle Yunnan box turtle yellow pond turtle Chinese pond turtle Chinese stripe-necked turtle and Chinese softshell turtle which all are considered threatened More than amphibian species are known from the Yangtze basin including the world s largest the critically endangered Chinese giant salamander It has declined drastically due to hunting it is considered a delicacy habitat loss and pollution The polluted Dian Lake which is part of the upper Yangtze watershed via Pudu River is home to several highly threatened fish but was also home to the Yunnan lake newt This newt has not been seen since and is considered extinct In contrast the Chinese fire belly newt from the lower Yangtze basin is one of the few Chinese salamander species to remain common and it is considered least concern by the IUCN The Chinese mitten crab is a commercially important species in the Yangtze but invasive in other parts of the world The Yangtze basin contains a large number of freshwater crab species including several endemics A particularly rich genus in the river basin is the potamid Sinopotamon The Chinese mitten crab is catadromous migrates between fresh and saltwater and it has been recorded up to km mi up the Yangtze which is the largest river in its native range It is a commercially important species in its native range where it is farmed but the Chinese mitten crab has also been spread to Europe and North America where considered invasive The freshwater jellyfish

    "content": "Bioenergy - Wikipedia Jump to content From Wikipedia the free encyclopedia Redirected from Biomass energy Renewable energy made from biomass This article is about technology aspects to produce a type of renewable energy For production of biomass for bioenergy generation see biomass energy This article may be unbalanced towards certain viewpoints Please help improve it by adding information on neglected viewpoints Relevant discussion may be found on the talk page May A CHP power station using wood to supply households in France with bioenergy as a renewable energy source Sugarcane plantation to produce ethanol for bioenergy production in Brazil Bioenergy is a type of renewable energy that is derived from plants and animal waste The biomass that is used as input materials consists of recently living but now dead organisms mainly plants Thus fossil fuels are not regarded as biomass under this definition Types of biomass commonly used for bioenergy include wood food crops such as corn energy crops and waste from forests yards or farms Bioenergy can help with climate change mitigation but in some cases the required biomass production can increase greenhouse gas emissions or lead to local biodiversity loss The environmental impacts of biomass production can be problematic depending on how the biomass is produced and harvested But it still produces CO so long as the energy is derived from breaking chemical bonds The IEA s Net Zero by scenario calls for traditional bioenergy to be phased out by with modern bioenergy s share increasing from in to in and in Bioenergy has a significant climate change mitigation potential if implemented correctly Most of the recommended pathways to limit global warming include substantial contributions from bioenergy in average at EJ B Definition and terminology edit See also Biomass energy Terminology and Biofuel Terminology The IPCC Sixth Assessment Report defines bioenergy as energy derived from any form of biomass or its metabolic by-products It goes on to define biomass in this context as organic material excluding the material that is fossilised or embedded in geological formations This means that coal or other fossil fuels is not a form of biomass in this context The term traditional biomass for bioenergy means the combustion of wood charcoal agricultural residues and or animal dung for cooking or heating in open fires or in inefficient stoves as is common in low-income countries Since biomass can also be used as a fuel directly e g wood logs the terms biomass and biofuel have sometimes been used interchangeably However the term biomass usually denotes the biological raw material the fuel is made of The terms biofuel or biogas are generally reserved for liquid or gaseous fuels respectively Input materials edit Main article Biomass energy Biomass plant in Scotland Wood and wood residues is the largest biomass energy source today Wood can be used as a fuel directly or processed into pellet fuel or other forms of fuels Other plants can also be used as fuel for instance maize switchgrass miscanthus and bamboo The main waste feedstocks are wood waste agricultural waste municipal solid waste and manufacturing waste Upgrading raw biomass to higher grade fuels can be achieved by different methods broadly classified as thermal chemical or biochemical Thermal conversion processes use heat as the dominant mechanism to upgrade biomass into a better and more practical fuel The basic alternatives are torrefaction pyrolysis and gasification these are separated mainly by the extent to which the chemical reactions involved are allowed to proceed mainly controlled by the availability of oxygen and conversion temperature Many chemical conversions are based on established coal-based processes such as the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis Like coal biomass can be converted into multiple commodity chemicals Biochemical processes have developed in nature to break down the molecules of which biomass is composed and many of these can be harnessed In most cases microorganisms are used to perform the conversion The processes are called anaerobic digestion fermentation and composting Applications edit Biomass for heating edit This section is an excerpt from Biomass heating system edit Wood chips in a storage hopper in the middle an agitator to transport the material with a screw conveyor to the boiler Biomass heating systems generate heat from biomass The systems may use direct combustion gasification combined heat and power CHP anaerobic digestion or aerobic digestion to produce heat Biomass heating may be fully automated or semi-automated they may be pellet-fired or they may be combined heat and power systems Biofuel for transportation edit Main article Biofuel Based on the source of biomass biofuels are classified broadly into two major categories depending if food crops are used or not First-generation or conventional biofuels are made from food sources grown on arable lands such as sugarcane and maize Sugars present in this biomass are fermented to produce bioethanol an alcohol fuel which serves as an additive to gasoline or in a fuel cell to produce electricity Bioethanol is made by fermentation mostly from carbohydrates produced in sugar or starch crops such as corn sugarcane or sweet sorghum Bioethanol is widely used in the United States and in Brazil Biodiesel is produced from the oils in for instance rapeseed or sugar beets and is the most common biofuel in Europe citation needed Second-generation biofuels also called advanced biofuels utilize non-food -based biomass sources such as perennial energy crops and agricultural residues waste The feedstock used to make the fuels either grow on arable land but are byproducts of the main crop or they are grown on marginal land Waste from industry agriculture forestry and households can also be used for second-generation biofuels using e g anaerobic digestion to produce biogas gasification to produce syngas or by direct combustion Cellulosic biomass derived from non-food sources such as trees and grasses is being developed as a feedstock for ethanol production and biodiesel can be produced from left-over food products like vegetable oils and animal fats citation needed Production of liquid fuels edit Biomass to liquid Bioconversion of biomass to mixed alcohol fuels Comparison with other renewable energy types edit Eucalyptus plantation in India Further information Renewable energy Bioenergy Land requirement edit The surface power production densities of a crop will determine how much land is required for production The average lifecycle surface power densities for biomass wind hydro and solar power production are W m W m W m and W m respectively power in the form of heat for biomass and electricity for wind hydro and solar Lifecycle surface power density includes land used by all supporting infrastructure manufacturing mining harvesting and decommissioning Another estimate puts the values at W m for biomass W m for hydro W m for wind and W m for solar median values with none of the renewable sources exceeding W m Related technologies edit Bioenergy with carbon capture and storage BECCS edit Carbon capture and storage technology can be used to capture emissions from bioenergy power plants This process is known as bioenergy with carbon capture and storage BECCS and can result in net carbon dioxide removal from the atmosphere However BECCS can also result in net positive emissions depending on how the biomass material is grown harvested and transported Deployment of BECCS at scales described in some climate change mitigation pathways would require converting large amounts of cropland This section is an excerpt from Bioenergy with carbon capture and storage edit Example of BECCS Diagram of bioenergy power plant with carbon capture and storage Bioenergy with carbon capture and storage BECCS is the process of extracting bioenergy from biomass and capturing and storing the carbon dioxide CO that is produced Greenhouse gas emissions from bioenergy can be low because when vegetation is harvested for bioenergy new vegetation can grow that will absorb CO from the air through photosynthesis After the biomass is harvested energy bioenergy is extracted in useful forms electricity heat biofuels etc as the biomass is utilized through combustion fermentation pyrolysis or other conversion methods Using bioenergy releases CO In BECCS some of the CO is captured before it enters the atmosphere and stored underground using carbon capture and storage technology Under some conditions BECCS can remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere The potential range of negative emissions from BECCS was estimated to be zero to giga tonnes per year As of there are large-scale BECCS projects operating in the world Wide deployment of BECCS is constrained by cost and availability of biomass Since biomass production is land-intensive deployment of BECCS can pose major risks to food production human rights and biodiversity Climate and sustainability aspects edit Further information Energy crop Carbon neutrality Alternative system boundaries for assessing climate effects of forest-based bioenergy Option black considers only the stack emissions Option green considers only the forest carbon stock Option blue considers the bioenergy supply chain Option red covers the whole bioeconomy including wood products in addition to biomass This section is an excerpt from Sustainable energy Bioenergy edit The climate impact of bioenergy varies considerably depending on where biomass feedstocks come from and how they are grown For example burning wood for energy releases carbon dioxide those emissions can be significantly offset if the trees that were harvested are replaced by new trees in a well-managed forest as the new trees will absorb carbon dioxide from the air as they grow However the establishment and cultivation of bioenergy crops can displace natural ecosystems degrade soils and consume water resources and synthetic fertilisers Approximately one-third of all wood used for traditional heating and cooking in tropical areas is harvested unsustainably Bioenergy feedstocks typically require significant amounts of energy to harvest dry and transport the energy usage for these processes may emit greenhouse gases In some cases the impacts of land-use change cultivation and processing can result in higher overall carbon emissions for bioenergy compared to using fossil fuels Use of farmland for growing biomass can result in less land being available for growing food In the United States around of motor gasoline has been replaced by corn-based ethanol which requires a significant proportion of the harvest In Malaysia and Indonesia clearing forests to produce palm oil for biodiesel has led to serious social and environmental effects as these forests are critical carbon sinks and habitats for diverse species Since photosynthesis captures only a small fraction of the energy in sunlight producing a given amount of bioenergy requires a large amount of land compared to other renewable energy sources Environmental impacts edit Main article Biomass energy Environmental impact Bioenergy can either mitigate i e reduce or increase greenhouse gas emissions Local environmental impacts can be problematic For example forests are sometimes cleared for the production of sugarcane-derived bioethanol like in the case of a large-scale project in Indonesia in Biomass production can create significant social and environmental pressure in the locations where the biomass is produced The impact is primarily related to the low surface power density of biomass The low surface power density has the effect that much larger land areas are needed in order to produce the same amount of energy compared to for instance fossil fuels Long-distance transport of biomass have been criticised as wasteful and unsustainable and there have been protests against forest biomass export in Sweden and Canada Scale and future trends edit In bioenergy produced EJ exajoules of energy compared to EJ from crude oil EJ from coal EJ from natural gas EJ from nuclear EJ from hydro and EJ from wind solar and geothermal combined Most of the global bioenergy is produced from forest resources Generally bioenergy expansion fell by in China and Europe are the only two regions that reported significant expansion in adding GW and GW of bioenergy capacity respectively Almost all available sawmill residue is already being utilized for pellet production so there is no room for expansion For the bioenergy sector to significantly expand in the future more of the harvested pulpwood must go to pellet mills However the harvest of pulpwood tree thinnings removes the possibility for these trees to grow old and therefore maximize their carbon holding capacity Compared to pulpwood sawmill residues have lower net emissions Some types of biomass feedstock can be carbon-neutral at least over a period of a few years including in particular sawmill residues These are wastes from other forest operations that imply no additional harvesting and if otherwise burnt as waste or left to rot would release carbon to the atmosphere in any case By country edit v t

northern part of the island of Great Britain and more than adjacent islands principally in the archipelagos of the Hebrides and the Northern Isles In the country s population was about million Its capital city is Edinburgh whilst Glasgow is the largest city and the most populous of the cities of Scotland To the south-east Scotland has its only land border which is miles km long and shared with England the country is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean to the north and west the North Sea to the north-east and east and the Irish Sea to the south The legislature the Scottish Parliament elects members to represent constituencies across the country The Scottish Government is the executive arm of the devolved government headed by the first minister who chairs the cabinet and is responsible for government policy and international engagement The Kingdom of Scotland emerged as an independent sovereign state in the th century In James VI succeeded to the thrones of England and Ireland forming a personal union of the three kingdoms On May Scotland and England combined to create the new Kingdom of Great Britain with the Parliament of Scotland subsumed into the Parliament of Great Britain In a Scottish Parliament was re-established and has devolved authority over many areas of domestic policy The country has its own distinct legal system education system and religious history which have all contributed to the continuation of Scottish culture and national identity Scottish English and Scots are the most widely spoken languages in the country existing on a dialect continuum with each other Scottish Gaelic speakers can be found all over Scotland but the language is largely spoken natively by communities within the Hebrides Gaelic speakers now constitute less than of the total population although state-sponsored revitalisation attempts have led to a growing community of second language speakers The mainland of Scotland is broadly divided into three regions the Highlands a mountainous region in the north and north-west the Lowlands a flatter plain across the centre of the country and the Southern Uplands a hilly region along the southern border The Highlands are the most mountainous region of the British Isles and contain its highest peak Ben Nevis at feet m The region also contains many lakes called lochs the term is also applied to the many saltwater inlets along the country s deeply indented western coastline The geography of the many islands is varied Some such as Mull and Skye are noted for their mountainous terrain while the likes of Tiree and Coll are much flatter Etymology Main article Etymology of Scotland Scotland comes from Scoti the Latin name for the Gaels Philip Freeman has speculated on the likelihood of a group of raiders adopting a name from an Indo-European root skot citing the parallel in Greek skotos meaning darkness gloom The Late Latin word Scotia land of the Gaels was initially used to refer to Ireland and likewise in early Old English Scotland was used for Ireland By the th century at the latest Scotia was being used to refer to Gaelic-speaking Scotland north of the River Forth alongside Albania or Albany both derived from the Gaelic Alba The use of the words Scots and Scotland to encompass all of what is now Scotland became common in the Late Middle Ages History Main article History of Scotland For a chronological guide see Timeline of Scottish history Prehistory The earliest known evidence of human presence in Scotland is Hamburgian culture stone tools produced by late Upper Paleolithic hunter gatherers who arrived in Scotland during the B lling Aller d Interstadial warm period at the end of the last ice age around to years ago shortly following the retreat of the ice sheet that had previously covered Scotland Neolithic farmers arrived in Scotland around years ago The well-preserved village of Skara Brae on the mainland of Orkney dates from this period Neolithic habitation burial and ritual sites are particularly common and well preserved in the Northern Isles and Western Isles where a lack of trees led to most structures being built of local stone Evidence of sophisticated pre-Christian belief systems is demonstrated by sites such as the Callanish Stones on Lewis and the Maes Howe on Orkney which were built in the third millennium BC Early history Main articles Scotland during the Roman Empire Roman Britain and Pictland Skara Brae Europe s most complete Neolithic village occupied from roughly BC BC The first written reference to Scotland was in BC by Greek sailor Pytheas who called the northern tip of Britain Orcas the source of the name of the Orkney islands Most of modern Scotland was not incorporated into the Roman Empire and Roman control over parts of the area fluctuated over a rather short period The first Roman incursion into Scotland was in AD when Agricola invaded Scotland he defeated a Caledonian army at the Battle of Mons Graupius in AD After the Roman victory Roman forts were briefly set along the Gask Ridge close to the Highland line but by three years after the battle the Roman armies had withdrawn to the Southern Uplands Remains of Roman forts established in the st century have been found as far north as the Moray Firth By the reign of the Roman emperor Trajan r Roman control had lapsed to Britain south of a line between the River Tyne and the Solway Firth Along this line Trajan s successor Hadrian r erected Hadrian s Wall in northern England and the Limes Britannicus became the northern border of the Roman Empire The Roman influence on the southern part of the country was considerable and they introduced Christianity to Scotland The Antonine Wall was built from at the order of Hadrian s successor Antoninus Pius r defending the Roman part of Scotland from the unadministered part of the island north of a line between the Firth of Clyde and the Firth of Forth The Roman invasion of Caledonia was undertaken by emperors of the imperial Severan dynasty in response to the breaking of a treaty by the Caledonians in but permanent conquest of the whole of Great Britain was forestalled by Roman forces becoming bogged down in punishing guerrilla warfare and the death of the senior emperor Septimius Severus r at Eboracum York after he was taken ill while on campaign Although forts erected by the Roman army in the Severan campaign were placed near those established by Agricola and were clustered at the mouths of the glens in the Highlands the Caledonians were again in revolt in and these were overrun Callanish Stones erected in the late Neolithic era To the Roman historians Tacitus and Cassius Dio the Scottish Highlands and the area north of the River Forth was called Caledonia According to Cassius Dio the inhabitants of Caledonia were the Caledonians and the Maeatae Other ancient authors used the adjective Caledonian to mean anywhere in northern or inland Britain often mentioning the region s people and animals its cold climate its pearls and a noteworthy region of wooded hills Latin saltus which the nd century AD Roman philosopher Ptolemy in his Geography described as being south-west of the Beauly Firth The name Caledonia is echoed in the place names of Dunkeld Rohallion and Schiehallion The Great Conspiracy constituted a seemingly coordinated invasion against Roman rule in Britain in the later th century which included the participation of the Gaelic Scoti and the Caledonians who were then known as Picts by the Romans This was defeated by the comes Theodosius but Roman military government was withdrawn from the island altogether by the early th century resulting in the Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain and the immigration of the Saxons to southeastern Scotland and the rest of eastern Great Britain Kingdom of Scotland Main articles Kingdom of Scotland Scotland in the Early Middle Ages Scotland in the High Middle Ages and Scotland in the Late Middle Ages Political divisions in early medieval Scotland Norse kingdoms at the end of the eleventh century Beginning in the sixth century the area that is now Scotland was divided into four areas Pictland a patchwork of small lordships in central Scotland the Anglo-Saxon Kingdom of Northumbria which had conquered southeastern Scotland Northern Brittonic territory likely centred on Alt Clut Dumbarton Rock and the Clyde valley and D l Riata which included territory in western Scotland and northern Ireland and spread Gaelic language and culture into Scotland These societies were based on the family unit and had sharp divisions in wealth although the vast majority were poor and worked full-time in subsistence agriculture The Picts kept slaves mostly captured in war through the ninth century Gaelic influence over Pictland and Northumbria was facilitated by the large number of Gaelic-speaking clerics working as missionaries Operating in the sixth century on the island of Iona Saint Columba was one of the earliest and best-known missionaries The Vikings began to raid Scotland in the eighth century Although the raiders sought slaves and luxury items their main motivation was to acquire land The oldest Norse settlements were in northwest Scotland but they eventually conquered many areas along the coast Old Norse entirely displaced Pictish in the Northern Isles In the ninth century the Norse threat allowed a Gael named Kenneth I Cin ed mac Ailp n to seize power over Pictland establishing a royal dynasty to which the modern monarchs trace their lineage and marking the beginning of the end of Pictish culture The kingdom of Cin ed and his descendants called Alba was Gaelic in character but existed on the same area as Pictland By the end of the tenth century the Pictish language went extinct as its speakers shifted to Gaelic From a base in eastern Scotland north of the River Forth and south of the River Spey the kingdom expanded first southwards into the former Northumbrian lands and northwards into Moray Around the turn of the millennium there was a centralization in agricultural lands and the first towns began to be established James V of Scotland at the Court of Session in at Parliament House Edinburgh the Parliament of Scotland until In the twelfth and thirteenth centuries much of Scotland was under the control of a single ruler Initially Gaelic culture predominated but immigrants from France England and Flanders steadily created a more diverse society with the Gaelic language starting to be replaced by Scots and a modern nation-state emerged from this At the end of this period war against England started the growth of a Scottish national consciousness ch David I and his successors centralised royal power and united mainland Scotland capturing regions such as Moray Galloway and Caithness although he could not extend his power over the Hebrides which had been ruled by various Scottish clans following the death of Somerled in In Scotland fought the short but consequential Scottish-Norwegian War which saw the reclamation of the Hebrides after the strong defeat of King Haakon IV and his forces at the Battle of Largs Up until that point the Hebrides had been under Norwegian Viking control for roughly years and had developed a distinctive Norse Gaelic culture that saw many Old Norse loanwords enter the Scottish Gaelic spoken by islanders and through successive generations the Norse would become almost completely assimilated into Gaelic culture and the Scottish clan system After the conflict Scotland had to affirm Norwegian sovereignty of the Northern Isles but they were later integrated into Scotland in the th century Scandinavian culture in the form of the Norn language survived for a lot longer than in the Hebrides and would strongly influence the local Scots dialect on Shetland and Orkney Later a system of feudalism was consolidated with both Anglo-Norman incomers and native Gaelic chieftains being granted land in exchange for serving the king The relationship with England was complex during this period Scottish kings tried several times sometimes with success to exploit English political turmoil followed by the longest period of peace between Scotland and England in the mediaeval period from - Wars of Scottish Independence Main articles Wars of Scottish Independence First War of Scottish Independence and Second War of Scottish Independence The Wallace Monument in Stirling commemorates Sir William Wallace a Scottish independence leader The death of Alexander III in March broke the succession line of Scotland s kings Edward I of England arbitrated between various claimants for the Scottish crown In return for surrendering Scotland s nominal independence John Balliol was pronounced king in In Balliol and other Scottish lords refused Edward s demands to serve in his army against the French Scotland and France sealed a treaty on October known as the Auld Alliance War ensued and John was deposed by Edward who took personal control of Scotland Andrew Moray and William Wallace initially emerged as the principal leaders of the resistance to English rule in the Wars of Scottish Independence until Robert the Bruce was crowned king of Scotland in Victory at the Battle of Bannockburn in proved the Scots had regained control of their kingdom In the world s first documented declaration of independence the Declaration of Arbroath won the support of Pope John XXII leading to the legal recognition of Scottish sovereignty by the English Crown A civil war between the Bruce dynasty and their long-term rivals of the House of Comyn and House of Balliol lasted until the middle of the th century Although the Bruce faction was successful David II s lack of an heir allowed his half-nephew Robert II the Lord High Steward of Scotland to come to the throne and establish the House of Stewart The Stewarts ruled Scotland for the remainder of the Middle Ages The country they ruled experienced greater prosperity from the end of the th century through the Scottish Renaissance to the Reformation despite the effects of the Black Death in and increasing division between Highlands and Lowlands Multiple truces reduced warfare on the southern border Union of the Crowns Main articles Scotland in the early modern period and Union of the Crowns James VI King of Scotland succeeded to the English and Irish thrones in The Treaty of Perpetual Peace was signed in by James IV of Scotland and Henry VII of England James married Henry s daughter Margaret Tudor James invaded England in support of France under the terms of the Auld Alliance and became the last monarch in Great Britain to die in battle at Flodden in The war with England during the minority years of Mary Queen of Scots between and is known as the Rough Wooing In the Treaty of Edinburgh brought an end to the Siege of Leith and recognized the Protestant Elizabeth I as Queen of England The Parliament of Scotland met and immediately adopted the Scots Confession which signalled the Scottish Reformation s sharp break from papal authority and Roman Catholic teaching The Catholic Mary Queen of Scots was forced to abdicate in In James VI King of Scots inherited the thrones of the Kingdom of England and the Kingdom of Ireland in the Union of the Crowns and moved to London This was a personal union as despite having the same monarch the kingdoms retained their separate parliaments laws and other institutions The first Union Jack was designed at James s behest to be flown in addition to the St Andrew s Cross on Scots vessels at sea James VI and I intended to create a single kingdom of Great Britain but was thwarted in his attempt to do so by the Parliament of England which supported the wrecking proposal that a full legal union be sought instead a proposal to which the Scots Parliament would not assent causing the king to withdraw the plan Except for a short period under the Protectorate Scotland remained a separate state in the th century but there was considerable conflict between the crown and the Covenanters over the form of church government The military was strengthened allowing the imposition of royal authority on the western Highland clans The Statutes of Iona compelled the cultural integration of Hebridean clan leaders In and again in the Parliament of Scotland unsuccessfully sought a union with England which was federative and not incorporating in which Scotland would retain a separate parliament The issue of union split the parliament in After the execution of the Scottish king at Whitehall in amid the Wars of the Three Kingdoms and its events in Scotland Oliver Cromwell the victorious Lord Protector imposed the British Isles first written constitution the Instrument of Government on Scotland in as part of the republican Commonwealth of England Scotland and Ireland The Protectorate Parliament was the first Westminster parliament to include representatives nominally from Scotland The monarchy of the House of Stuart was resumed with the Restoration in Scotland in The Parliament of Scotland sought a commercial union with England in the proposal was rejected in In the Parliament of England rejected a proposed political union with Scotland English proposals along the same lines were abandoned in and in The Scots Parliament rejected proposals for a political union with England in Jacobitism the political support for the exiled Catholic Stuart dynasty remained a threat to the security of the British state under the Protestant House of Orange and the succeeding House of Hanover until the defeat of the Jacobite rising of In the Company of Scotland attempted a project to secure a trading colony on the Isthmus of Panama Almost every Scottish landowner who had money to spare is said to have invested in the Darien scheme Treaty of Union Main article Treaty of Union Further information Kingdom of Great Britain Scottish Exemplification official copy of the Treaty of Union of After another proposal from the English House of Lords was rejected in and a further Lords motion was voted down in the House of Commons in the Parliament of Scotland again rejected union in The failure of the Darien Scheme bankrupted the landowners who had invested though not the burghs Nevertheless the nobles bankruptcy along with the threat of an English invasion played a leading role in convincing the Scots elite to back a union with England On July the Treaty of Union was agreed between representatives of the Scots Parliament and the Parliament of England The following year twin Acts of Union were passed by both parliaments to create the united Kingdom of Great Britain with effect from May with popular opposition and anti-union riots in Edinburgh Glasgow and elsewhere The union also created the Parliament of Great Britain which succeeded both the Parliament of Scotland and the Parliament of England which rejected proposals from the Parliament of Ireland that the third kingdom be incorporated in the union James Ogilvy former Lord Chancellor initially supported union but by advocated for its reversal Andrew Fletcher a prominent Scottish patriot argued that the ratification of the treaty would see Scotland more like a conquered province and by the former Lord Chancellor of Scotland James Ogilvy th Earl of Findlater who was a prominent supporter for the Treaty of Union between Scotland and England had changed his position on the treaty and unsuccessfully advocated for the treaty to be reversed The deposed Jacobite Stuart claimants had remained popular in the Highlands and north-east particularly among non- Presbyterians including Roman Catholics and Episcopalian Protestants Two major Jacobite risings launched in and failed to remove the House of Hanover from the British throne The threat of the Jacobite movement to the United Kingdom and its monarchs effectively ended at the Battle of Culloden Great Britain s last pitched battle The passing of the Treaty of Union did not bring about immediate economic prosperity to Scotland as was widely speculated by the pamphleteer as a result of the little consideration given to prospects of the Scottish economy Campaigners for the union between Scotland and England believed that there would be economic advantages to Scotland as a result of the failed Darien scheme which left the Kingdom of Scotland bankrupt Eventually however with trade tariffs with England abolished trade blossomed especially with Colonial America The clippers belonging to the Glasgow Tobacco Lords were the fastest ships on the route to Virginia Until the American War of Independence in Glasgow was the world s premier tobacco port dominating world trade The disparity between the wealth of the merchant classes of the Scottish Lowlands and the ancient clans of the Scottish Highlands grew amplifying centuries of division In the Highlands clan chiefs gradually started to think of themselves more as commercial landlords than leaders of their people These social and economic changes included the first phase of the Highland Clearances and ultimately the demise of clanship passim Industrial age and the Scottish Enlightenment Main article Scotland in the modern era Walter Scott whose Waverley Novels helped define Scottish identity in the th century The Scottish Enlightenment and the Industrial Revolution turned Scotland into an intellectual commercial and industrial powerhouse so much so Voltaire said We look to Scotland for all our ideas of civilisation With the demise of Jacobitism and the advent of the Union thousands of Scots mainly Lowlanders took up numerous positions of power in politics civil service the army and navy trade economics colonial enterprises and other areas across the nascent British Empire Historian Neil Davidson notes after there was an entirely new level of participation by Scots in political life particularly outside Scotland Davidson also states far from being peripheral to the British economy Scotland or more precisely the Lowlands lay at its core The Scottish Reform Act increased the number of Scottish MPs and widened the franchise to include more of the middle classes From the mid-century there were increasing calls for Home Rule for Scotland and the post of Secretary of State for Scotland was revived Towards the end of the century prime ministers of Scottish descent included William Gladstone and the Earl of Rosebery In the late th century the growing importance of the working classes was marked by Keir Hardie s success in the Mid Lanarkshire by-election leading to the foundation of the Scottish Labour Party which was absorbed into the Independent Labour Party in with Hardie as its first leader Glasgow became one of the largest cities in the world and known as the Second City of the Empire after London After the Clydeside shipyards specialised in steamships made of iron after made of steel which rapidly replaced the wooden sailing vessels of both the merchant fleets and the battle fleets of the world It became the world s pre-eminent shipbuilding centre The industrial developments while they brought work and wealth were so rapid that housing town planning and provision for public health did not keep pace with them and for a time living conditions in some of the towns and cities were notoriously bad with overcrowding high infant mortality and growing rates of tuberculosis While the Scottish Enlightenment is traditionally considered to have concluded toward the end of the th century disproportionately large Scottish contributions to British science and letters continued for another years or more thanks to such figures as the physicists James Clerk Maxwell and Lord Kelvin and the engineers and inventors James Watt and William Murdoch whose work was critical to the technological developments of the Industrial Revolution throughout Britain In literature the most successful figure of the mid- th century was Walter Scott His first prose work Waverley in is often called the first historical novel It launched a highly successful career that probably more than any other helped define and popularise Scottish cultural identity In the late th century a number of Scottish-born authors achieved international reputations such as Robert Louis Stevenson Arthur Conan Doyle J M Barrie and George MacDonald Scotland also played a major part in the development of art and architecture The Glasgow School which developed in the late th century and flourished in the early th century produced a distinctive blend of influences including the Celtic Revival the Arts and Crafts movement and Japonism which found favour throughout the modern art world of continental Europe and helped define the Art Nouveau style Proponents included architect and artist Charles Rennie Mackintosh World wars and Scotland Act A piper of the Seaforth Highlanders leads the th Brigade back from the trenches during the Battle of Bazentin Ridge July Scotland played a major role in the British effort in the First World War It especially provided manpower ships machinery fish and money With a population of million in Scotland sent over half a million men to the war of whom over a quarter died in combat or from disease and were seriously wounded Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig was Britain s commander on the Western Front The war saw the emergence of a radical movement called Red Clydeside led by militant trades unionists Formerly a Liberal stronghold the industrial districts switched to Labour by with a base among the Irish Catholic working-class districts Women were especially active in building neighbourhood solidarity on housing issues The Reds operated within the Labour Party with little influence in Parliament and the mood changed to passive despair by the late s During the Second World War Scotland was targeted by Nazi Germany largely due to its factories shipyards and coal mines Cities such as Glasgow and Edinburgh were targeted by German bombers as were smaller towns mostly located in the central belt of the country Perhaps the most significant air raid in Scotland was the Clydebank Blitz of March which intended to destroy naval shipbuilding in the area people were killed and homes destroyed Perhaps Scotland s most unusual wartime episode occurred in when Rudolf Hess flew to Renfrewshire possibly intending to broker a peace deal through the Duke of Hamilton Before his departure from Germany Hess had given his adjutant Karlheinz Pintsch a letter addressed to Adolf Hitler that detailed his intentions to open peace negotiations with the British Pintsch delivered the letter to Hitler at the Berghof around noon on May Albert Speer later said Hitler described Hess s departure as one of the worst personal blows of his life as he considered it a personal betrayal Hitler worried that his allies Italy and Japan would perceive Hess s act as an attempt by Hitler to secretly open peace negotiations with the British Reconvening of the Scottish Parliament in July with Donald Dewar first minister left and Queen Elizabeth II centre After Scotland s economic situation worsened due to overseas competition inefficient industry and industrial disputes Only in recent decades has the country enjoyed something of a cultural and economic renaissance Economic factors contributing to this recovery included a resurgent financial services industry electronics manufacturing see Silicon Glen and the North Sea oil and gas industry The introduction in by Margaret Thatcher s government of the Community Charge widely known as the Poll Tax one year before the rest of Great Britain contributed to a growing movement for Scottish control over domestic affairs On December Pan Am Flight exploded mid air over the town of Lockerbie killing all on board as well as eleven Lockerbie residents It remains the deadliest terrorist attack in the United Kingdom Following a referendum on devolution proposals in the Scotland Act was passed by the British Parliament which established a devolved Scottish Parliament and Scottish Government with responsibility for most laws specific to Scotland The Scottish Parliament was reconvened in Edinburgh on July The first to hold the office of first minister of Scotland was Donald Dewar who served until his sudden death in st century The signing of the Edinburgh Agreement permitted a referendum on independence to be held in The Scottish Parliament Building at Holyrood opened in October after lengthy construction delays and running over budget The Scottish Parliament s form of proportional representation the additional member system resulted in no one party having an overall majority for the first three Scottish parliament elections The pro- independence Scottish National Party led by Alex Salmond achieved an overall majority in the election winning of the seats available The success of the SNP in achieving a majority in the Scottish Parliament paved the way for the September referendum on Scottish independence The majority voted against the proposition with voting no to independence More powers particularly concerning taxation were devolved to the Scottish Parliament after the referendum following cross-party talks in the Smith Commission Since the referendum events such as the UK leaving the European Union despite a majority of voters in Scotland voting to remain a member have led to calls for a second independence referendum In the Lord Advocate Dorothy Bain argued the case for the Scottish Government to hold another referendum on the issue with the Supreme Court later ruling against the argument Following the Supreme Court decision the Scottish Government stated that it wished to make amendments to the Scotland Act that would allow a referendum to be held Geography and

article Geology of Scotland Arthur s Seat Edinburgh Loch Lomond a freshwater loch often considered the boundary between the lowlands and Highlands The whole of Scotland was covered by ice sheets during the Pleistocene ice ages and the landscape is much affected by glaciation From a geological perspective the country has three main sub-divisions the Highlands and Islands the Central Lowlands and the Southern Uplands The Highlands and Islands lie to the north and west of the Highland Boundary Fault which runs from Arran to Stonehaven This part of Scotland largely comprises ancient rocks from the Cambrian and Precambrian which were uplifted during the later Caledonian orogeny It is interspersed with igneous intrusions of a more recent age remnants of which formed mountain massifs such as the Cairngorms and the Cuillin In north-eastern mainland Scotland weathering of rock that occurred before the Last Ice Age has shaped much of the landscape A significant exception to the above are the fossil-bearing beds of Old Red Sandstones found principally along the Moray Firth coast The Highlands are generally mountainous and the highest elevations in the British Isles are found here Scotland has over islands divided into four main groups Shetland Orkney and the Inner Hebrides and Outer Hebrides There are numerous bodies of freshwater including Loch Lomond and Loch Ness Some parts of the coastline consist of machair a low-lying dune pasture land The Central Lowlands is a rift valley mainly comprising Paleozoic formations Many of these sediments have economic significance for it is here that the coal and iron-bearing rocks that fuelled Scotland s industrial revolution are found This area has also experienced intense volcanism Arthur s Seat in Edinburgh being the remnant of a once much larger volcano This area is relatively low-lying although even here hills such as the Ochils and Campsie Fells are rarely far from view The Southern Uplands is a range of hills almost miles km long interspersed with broad valleys They lie south of a second fault line the Southern Uplands fault that runs from Girvan to Dunbar The geological foundations largely comprise Silurian deposits laid down some to million years ago The high point of the Southern Uplands is Merrick with an elevation of m ft The Southern Uplands is home to Scotland s highest village Wanlockhead m or ft above sea level Climate Main article Climate of Scotland Tiree in the Inner Hebrides is one of the sunniest locations in Scotland The climate of most of Scotland is temperate and oceanic and tends to be very changeable As it is warmed by the Gulf Stream from the Atlantic it has much milder winters but cooler wetter summers than areas on similar latitudes such as Labrador southern Scandinavia the Moscow region in Russia and the Kamchatka Peninsula on the opposite side of Eurasia Temperatures are generally lower than in the rest of the UK with the temperature of C F recorded at Braemar in the Grampian Mountains on February the coldest ever recorded anywhere in the UK Winter maxima average C F in the Lowlands with summer maxima averaging C F The highest temperature recorded was C F at Charterhall Scottish Borders on July The west of Scotland is usually warmer than the east owing to the influence of Atlantic ocean currents and the colder surface temperatures of the North Sea Tiree in the Inner Hebrides is one of the sunniest places in the country it had more than hours of sunshine in May Rainfall varies widely across Scotland The western highlands of Scotland are the wettest with annual rainfall in a few places exceeding mm in In comparison much of lowland Scotland receives less than mm in annually Heavy snowfall is not common in the lowlands but becomes more common with altitude Braemar has an average of snow days per year while many coastal areas average fewer than days of lying snow per year Flora and fauna Main articles Fauna of Scotland and Flora of Scotland White-tailed sea eagle Scotland s wildlife is typical of the north-west of Europe although several of the larger mammals such as the lynx brown bear wolf elk and walrus were hunted to extinction in historic times

tops species including ptarmigan mountain hare and stoat can be seen in their white colour phase during winter months Remnants of the native Scots pine forest exist and within these areas the Scottish crossbill the UK s only endemic bird species and vertebrate can be found alongside capercaillie Scottish wildcat red squirrel and pine marten Various animals have been re-introduced including the white-tailed eagle in the red kite in the s and there have been experimental projects involving the beaver and wild boar which are both now relatively widespread Today much of the remaining native Caledonian Forest lies within the Cairngorms National Park and remnants of the forest remain at locations across Scotland On the west coast remnants of ancient Celtic Rainforest remain particularly on the Taynish peninsula in Argyll these forests are particularly rare due to high rates of deforestation throughout Scottish history Scotland now ranks in the lowest of countries in the Biodiversity Intactness Index The flora of the country is varied incorporating both deciduous and coniferous woodland as well as moorland and tundra species Large-scale commercial tree planting and management of

United States and Canada principally from the Highlands which remained poor in comparison to elsewhere in Scotland The Highlands was the only part of mainland Britain with a recurrent famine A small range of products were exported from the region which had negligible industrial production and a continued population growth that tested the subsistence agriculture These problems and the desire to improve agriculture and profits were the driving forces of the ongoing Highland Clearances in which many of the population of the Highlands suffered eviction as lands were enclosed principally so that they could be used for sheep farming The first phase of the clearances followed patterns of agricultural change throughout Britain The second phase was driven by overpopulation the Highland Potato Famine and the collapse of industries that had relied on the wartime economy of the Napoleonic Wars The population of Scotland grew steadily in the th century from in the census of to in and in Even

Archived from the original on May Retrieved October UK Internal Market Act imposed new restrictions on the ability of the devolved institutions to enact measures mutual recognition and non-discrimination requirements mean that standards set by the legislatures in Wales and Scotland cannot restrict the sale of goods which are acceptable in other parts of the UK In other words imposing such measures would simply create competitive disadvantages for businesses in Wales and Scotland they would not change the product standards or environmental protections applicable to all goods which can be purchased in Wales and Scotland Dougan Michael Hunt Jo McEwen Nicola McHarg Aileen Sleeping with an Elephant Devolution and the United Kingdom Internal Market Act Law Quarterly Review Oct London Sweet Maxwell ISSN - X SSRN Archived from the original on August Retrieved March via Durham Research Online The Act has restrictive and potentially damaging consequences for the regulatory capacity of the devolved legislatures the primary purpose of the legislation was to constrain the capacity of the devolved institutions to use their regulatory autonomy in practice it constrains the ability of the devolved institutions to make effective regulatory choices for their territories in ways that do not apply to the choices made by the UK government and parliament for the English market Guderjan Marius Intergovernmental Relations in the UK Cooperation and Conflict in a Devolved Unitary State London New York Routledge pp doi ISBN - - - - S CID Since the act became law on December the devolved administrations can continue to set standards for goods and services produced within their territory but their rules do not apply to goods and services coming from other jurisdictions They also must accept products imported into one part of the UK This undermines their legislative autonomy and renders certain policies ineffective Keating Michael February Taking back control Brexit and the territorial constitution of the United Kingdom Journal of European Public Policy Abingdon Taylor Francis doi hdl The UK Internal Market Act gives ministers sweeping powers to enforce mutual recognition and non-discrimination across the four jurisdictions Existing differences and some social and health matters are exempted but these are much less extensive than the exemptions permitted under the EU Internal Market provisions Only after an amendment in the House of Lords the Bill was amended to provide a weak and non-binding consent mechanism for amendments equivalent to the Sewel Convention to the list of exemptions The result is that while the devolved governments retain regulatory competences these are undermined by the fact that goods and services originating in or imported into England can be marketed anywhere Lydgate Emily Anthony Chloe September Brexit food law and the UK s search for a post-EU identity Modern Law Review London Wiley doi - While the mutual recognition principle preserves devolved powers rather than requiring that devolved nations conform with a wide range of harmonised standards as they did in the EU the Act undermines devolution simply because devolved legislation will no longer apply to all relevant activity in the devolved territory Devolution is also undermined by the asymmetry of legislative authority the UK Internal Market Act is a protected enactment which devolved administrations are unable to appeal or modify but which the UK parliament will be able to modify when legislating for England Dougan Michael Hayward Katy Hunt Jo McEwen Nicola McHarg Aileen Wincott Daniel UK and the Internal Market Devolution and the Union Centre on Constitutional Change Report University of Edinburgh University of Aberdeen pp Archived from the original on October Retrieved October The market access principles undermine devolved competences in two ways they significantly undermine the purpose of devolution which was to enable the devolved nations and regions to legislate according to their own local needs and political preferences Armstrong Kenneth A May The Governance of Economic Unionism after the United Kingdom Internal Market Act Modern Law Review Oxford Wiley doi - So when used to disapply relevant requirements in a destination devolved jurisdiction the effect is different from that generated by the devolution statutes when they treat rules that are outside of competence as being not law In this way the legislative competence of each jurisdiction is formally maintained but its exercise constrained by the extraterritorial reach of regulatory norms applicable elsewhere in the UK and by the potential for regulatory competition where local producers are subject to local rules but competing goods can enter that market in compliance with the regulatory standards from where they originate the UKIM Act allows extraterritorial application of rules that reflect different preferences or even undermines local preferences through regulatory competition its effects are not insignificant for devolved legislatures Porter David January Party people confront new realities BBC News

For other applications see Bioenergy A sample of biodiesel Part of a series on Renewable energy Biofuel Biogas Biomass Carbon-neutral fuel Crosswind kite power Geothermal energy Geothermal heating Geothermal power Hydroelectricity Run-of-the-river Hydropower Micro hydro Pico hydro Small hydro Marine current power Marine energy Ocean thermal Osmotic power Solar energy Solar power Sustainable biofuel Tidal power Tidal stream generator Wave power Wind power Nuclear power proposed as renewable energy Topics by country and territory Marketing and policy trends v t e Biofuel is a fuel that is produced over a short time span from biomass rather than by the very slow natural processes involved in the formation of fossil fuels such as oil Biofuel can be produced from plants or from agricultural domestic or industrial bio waste Biofuels are mostly used for transportation but can also be used for heating and electricity Biofuels and bio energy in general are regarded as a renewable energy source The use of biofuel has been subject to criticism regarding the food vs fuel debate varied assessments of their sustainability and ongoing deforestation and biodiversity loss as a result of biofuel production In general biofuels emit fewer greenhouse gas emissions when burned in an engine and are generally considered carbon-neutral fuels as the carbon emitted has been captured from the atmosphere by the crops used in production However life-cycle assessments of biofuels have shown large emissions associated with the potential land-use change required to produce additional biofuel feedstocks The outcomes of lifecycle assessments LCAs for biofuels are highly situational and dependent on many factors including the type of feedstock production routes data variations and methodological choices Estimates about the climate impact from biofuels vary widely based on the methodology and exact situation examined Therefore the climate change mitigation potential of biofuel varies considerably in some scenarios emission levels are comparable to fossil fuels and in other scenarios the biofuel emissions result in negative emissions Global demand for biofuels is predicted to increase by over By worldwide biofuel production is expected to supply of the world s fuels for transport including of aviation fuel Demand for aviation biofuel is forecast to increase However some policy has been criticised for favoring ground transportation over aviation The two most common types of biofuel are bioethanol and biodiesel Brazil is the largest producer of bioethanol while the EU is the largest producer of biodiesel The energy content in the global production of bioethanol and biodiesel is and EJ per year respectively Bioethanol is an alcohol made by fermentation mostly from carbohydrates produced in sugar or starch crops such as maize sugarcane or sweet sorghum Cellulosic biomass derived from non-food sources such as trees and grasses is also being developed as a feedstock for ethanol production Ethanol can be used as a fuel for vehicles in its pure form E but it is usually used as a gasoline additive to increase octane ratings and improve vehicle emissions Biodiesel is produced from oils or fats using transesterification It can be used as a fuel for vehicles in its pure form B but it is usually used as a diesel additive to reduce levels of particulates carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons from diesel-powered vehicles Terminology edit See also Biomass energy Terminology Types and generation of biofuels The term biofuel is used in different ways One definition is Biofuels are biobased products in solid liquid or gaseous forms They are produced from crops or natural products such as wood or agricultural residues such as molasses and bagasse Other publications reserve the term biofuel for liquid or gaseous fuels used for transportation The IPCC Sixth Assessment Report defines biofuel as A fuel generally in liquid form produced from biomass Biofuels include bioethanol from sugarcane sugar beet or maize and biodiesel from canola or soybeans It goes on to define biomass in this context as organic material excluding the material that is fossilised or embedded in geological formations This means that coal or other fossil fuels is not a form of biomass in this context Conventional biofuels first generation edit First-generation biofuels also denoted as conventional biofuels are made from food crops grown on arable land The crop s sugar starch or oil content is converted into biodiesel or ethanol using transesterification or yeast fermentation Advanced biofuels edit To avoid a food versus fuel dilemma second-generation biofuels and third-generation biofuels also called advanced biofuels or sustainable biofuels or drop-in biofuels are made from feedstocks which do not directly compete with food or feed crop such as waste products and energy crops A wide range of renewable residue feedstocks such as those derived from agriculture and forestry activities like rice straw rice husk wood chips and sawdust can be used to produce advanced biofuels through biochemical and thermochemical processes g The feedstock used to make the fuels either grow on arable land but are byproducts of the main crop or they are grown on marginal land Second-generation feedstocks also include straw bagasse perennial grasses jatropha waste vegetable oil municipal solid waste and so forth Types edit Liquid edit Ethanol edit Main article Ethanol fuel Biologically produced alcohols most commonly ethanol and less commonly propanol and butanol are produced by the action of microorganisms and enzymes through the fermentation of sugars or starches easiest to produce or cellulose more difficult to produce The IEA estimates that ethanol production used of sugar supplies and of corn supplies in Ethanol fuel is the most common biofuel worldwide particularly in Brazil Alcohol fuels are produced by fermentation of sugars derived from wheat corn sugar beets sugar cane molasses and any sugar or starch from which alcoholic beverages such as whiskey can be made such as potato and fruit waste etc Production methods used are enzyme digestion to release sugars from stored starches fermentation of the sugars distillation and drying The distillation process requires significant energy input to generate heat Heat is sometimes generated with unsustainable natural gas fossil fuel but cellulosic biomass such as bagasse is the most common fuel in Brazil while pellets wood chips and also waste heat are more common in Europe Corn-to-ethanol and other food stocks has led to the development of cellulosic ethanol Ethanol fuel can be combined with gasoline to create a more environmentally friendly fuel though there are more viable substitutions to gasoline such as Butanol Other biofuels edit Methanol is currently produced from natural gas a non-renewable fossil fuel In the future it is hoped to be produced from biomass as biomethanol This is technically feasible but the production is currently being postponed for concerns that the economic viability is still pending The methanol economy is an alternative to the hydrogen economy to be contrasted with today s hydrogen production from natural gas Butanol C H OH is formed by ABE fermentation acetone butanol ethanol and experimental modifications of the process show potentially high net energy gains with biobutanol as the only liquid product Biobutanol is often claimed to provide a direct replacement for gasoline because it will produce more energy than ethanol and allegedly can be burned straight in existing gasoline engines without modification to the engine or car is less corrosive and less water-soluble than ethanol and could be distributed via existing infrastructures Escherichia coli strains have also been successfully engineered to produce butanol by modifying their amino acid metabolism One drawback to butanol production in E coli remains the high cost of nutrient rich media however recent work has demonstrated E coli can produce butanol with minimal nutritional supplementation Biobutanol is sometimes called biogasoline which is incorrect as it is chemically different being an alcohol and not a hydrocarbon like gasoline Biodiesel edit Biofuel pumps Main article Biodiesel Further information Biodiesel around the world Biodiesel is the most common biofuel in Europe It is produced from oils or fats using transesterification and is a liquid similar in composition to fossil mineral diesel Chemically it consists mostly of fatty acid methyl or ethyl esters FAMEs Feedstocks for biodiesel include animal fats vegetable oils soy rapeseed jatropha mahua mustard flax sunflower palm oil hemp field pennycress Pongamia pinnata and algae Pure biodiesel B also known as neat biodiesel currently reduces emissions with up to compared to diesel Second generation B As of update researchers at Australia s CSIRO have been studying safflower oil as an engine lubricant and researchers at Montana State University s Advanced Fuels Center in the US have been studying the oil s performance in a large diesel engine with results described as a breakthrough Targray Biofuels Division railcar transporting Biodiesel Biodiesel can be used in any diesel engine and modified equipment when mixed with mineral diesel It can also be used in its pure form B in diesel engines but some maintenance and performance problems may occur during wintertime utilization since the fuel becomes somewhat more viscous at lower temperatures depending on the feedstock used Electronically controlled common rail and Unit Injector type systems from the late s onwards can only use biodiesel blended with conventional diesel fuel These engines have finely metered and atomized multiple-stage injection systems that are very sensitive to the viscosity of the fuel Many current-generation diesel engines are designed to run on B without altering the engine itself although this depends on the fuel rail design Since biodiesel is an effective solvent and cleans residues deposited by mineral diesel engine filters may need to be replaced more often as the biofuel dissolves old deposits in the fuel tank and pipes It also effectively cleans the engine combustion chamber of carbon deposits helping to maintain efficiency Biodiesel is an oxygenated fuel meaning it contains a reduced amount of carbon and higher hydrogen and oxygen content than fossil diesel This improves the combustion of biodiesel and reduces the particulate emissions from unburnt carbon However using pure biodiesel may increase NO x -emissions Biodiesel is also safe to handle and transport because it is non-toxic and biodegradable and has a high flash point of about F C compared to petroleum diesel fuel which has a flash point of F C In many European countries a biodiesel blend is widely used and is available at thousands of gas stations In France biodiesel is incorporated at a rate of in the fuel used by all French diesel vehicles Avril Group produces under the brand Diester a fifth of million tons of biodiesel consumed annually by the European Union It is the leading European producer of biodiesel Green diesel edit Main article Biodiesel production Green diesel can be produced from a combination of biochemical and thermochemical processes Conventional green diesel is produced through hydroprocessing biological oil feedstocks such as vegetable oils and animal fats Recently it is produced using series of thermochemical processes such as pyrolysis and hydroprocessing In the thermochemical route syngas produced from gasification bio-oil produced from pyrolysis or biocrude produced from hydrothermal liquefaction is upgraded to green diesel using hydroprocessing Hydroprocessing is the process of using hydrogen to reform a molecular structure For example hydrocracking which is a widely used hydroprocessing technique in refineries is used at elevated temperatures and pressure in the presence of a catalyst to break down larger molecules such as those found in vegetable oils into shorter hydrocarbon chains used in diesel engines Green diesel may also be called renewable diesel drop-in biodiesel hydrotreated vegetable oil HVO fuel or hydrogen-derived renewable diesel Unlike biodiesel green diesel has exactly the same chemical properties as petroleum-based diesel It does not require new engines pipelines or infrastructure to distribute and use but has not been produced at a cost that is competitive with petroleum Gasoline versions are also being developed Green diesel is being developed in Louisiana and Singapore by ConocoPhillips Neste Oil Valero Dynamic Fuels and Honeywell UOP as well as Preem in Gothenburg Sweden creating what is known as Evolution Diesel Straight vegetable oil edit A biofuel truck in Main article Vegetable oil fuel Straight unmodified edible vegetable oil is generally not used as fuel but lower-quality oil has been used for this purpose Used vegetable oil is increasingly being processed into biodiesel or more rarely cleaned of water and particulates and then used as a fuel The IEA estimates that biodiesel production used of global vegetable oil supplies in Oils and fats reacted with pounds of a short-chain alcohol usually methanol in the presence of a catalyst usually sodium hydroxide NaOH can be hydrogenated to give a diesel substitute The resulting product is a straight-chain hydrocarbon with a high cetane number low in aromatics and sulfur and does not contain oxygen Hydrogenated oils can be blended with diesel in all proportions They have several advantages over biodiesel including good performance at low temperatures no storage stability problems and no susceptibility to microbial attack Biogasoline edit Main article Biogasoline Biogasoline can be produced biologically and thermochemically Using biological methods a study led by Professor Lee Sang-yup at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology KAIST and published in the international science journal Nature used modified E coli fed with glucose found in plants or other non-food crops to produce biogasoline with the produced enzymes The enzymes converted the sugar into fatty acids and then turned these into hydrocarbons that were chemically and structurally identical to those found in commercial gasoline fuel The thermochemical approach of producing biogasoline are similar to those used to produce biodiesel Biogasoline may also be called drop-in gasoline or renewable gasoline Bioethers edit Neat ethanol on the left A gasoline on the right G at a filling station in Brazil in Bioethers also referred to as fuel ethers or oxygenated fuels are cost-effective compounds that act as octane rating enhancers Bioethers are produced by the reaction of reactive iso-olefins such as iso-butylene with bioethanol attribution needed Bioethers are created from wheat or sugar beets and also be produced from the waste glycerol that results from the production of biodiesel They also enhance engine performance while significantly reducing engine wear and toxic exhaust emissions By greatly reducing the amount of ground-level ozone emissions they contribute to improved air quality In transportation fuel there are six ether additives dimethyl ether DME diethyl ether DEE methyl tert -butyl ether MTBE ethyl tert -butyl ether ETBE tert -amyl methyl ether TAME and tert -amyl ethyl ether TAEE The European Fuel Oxygenates Association identifies MTBE and ETBE as the most commonly used ethers in fuel to replace lead Ethers were introduced in Europe in the s to replace the highly toxic compound Although Europeans still use bioether additives the U S Energy Policy Act of lifted a requirement for reformulated gasoline to include an oxygenate leading to less MTBE being added to fuel Although bioethers are likely to replace ethers produced from petroleum in the UK it is highly unlikely they will become a fuel in and of itself due to the low energy density Aviation biofuel edit This section is an excerpt from Aviation biofuel edit Refueling an Airbus A with biofuel in An aviation biofuel also known as bio-jet fuel sustainable aviation fuel SAF or bio-aviation fuel BAF is a biofuel used to power aircraft The International Air Transport Association IATA considers it a key element in reducing the environmental impact of aviation Aviation biofuel is used to decarbonize medium and long-haul air travel These types of travel generate the most emissions Synthetic paraffinic kerosene SPK refers to any non-petroleum-based fuel designed to replace kerosene jet fuel which is often but not always made from biomass Biofuels are biomass -derived fuels from plants animals or waste depending on which type of biomass is used they could lower CO emissions by compared to conventional jet fuel The first test flight using blended biofuel was in and in blended fuels with biofuels were allowed on commercial flights In SAF production was million liters representing of global jet fuel use By SAF production was to increase to billion liters million tonnes representing of global jet fuel consumption and of global renewable fuel production This increase came as major US production facilities delayed their ramp-up until having initially been expected to reach billion liters Aviation biofuel can be produced from plant or animal sources such as Jatropha algae tallows waste oils palm oil Babassu and Camelina bio-SPK from solid biomass using pyrolysis processed with a Fischer Tropsch process FT-SPK with an alcohol -to-jet ATJ process from waste fermentation or from synthetic biology through a solar reactor Small piston engines can be modified to burn ethanol Sustainable biofuels are an alternative to electrofuels Sustainable aviation fuel is certified as being sustainable by a third-party organisation SAF technology faces significant challenges due to feedstock constraints The oils and fats known as hydrotreated esters and fatty acids Hefa crucial for SAF production are in limited supply as demand increases Although advanced e-fuels technology which combines waste CO with clean hydrogen presents a promising solution it is still under development and comes with high costs To overcome these issues SAF developers are exploring more readily available feedstocks such as woody biomass and agricultural and municipal waste aiming to produce lower-carbon jet fuel more sustainably and efficiently Gaseous edit Biogas and biomethane edit Biogas plant in Main article Biogas Biogas is a mixture composed primarily of methane and carbon dioxide produced by the process of anaerobic digestion of organic material by micro-organisms Other trace components of this mixture includes water vapor hydrogen sulfide siloxanes hydrocarbons ammonia oxygen carbon monoxide and nitrogen It can be produced either from biodegradable waste materials or by the use of energy crops fed into anaerobic digesters to supplement gas yields The solid byproduct digestate can be used as a biofuel or a fertilizer When CO and other impurities are removed from biogas it is called biomethane The CO can also be combined with hydrogen in methanation to form more methane Biogas can be recovered from mechanical biological treatment waste processing systems Landfill gas a less clean form of biogas is produced in landfills through naturally occurring anaerobic digestion If it escapes into the atmosphere it acts as a greenhouse gas In Sweden waste-to-energy power plants capture methane biogas from garbage and use it to power transport systems Farmers can produce biogas from cattle manure via anaerobic digesters Syngas edit Main article Gasification Syngas a mixture of carbon monoxide hydrogen and various hydrocarbons is produced by partial combustion of biomass combustion with an amount of oxygen that is not sufficient to convert the biomass completely to carbon dioxide and water Before partial combustion the biomass is dried and sometimes pyrolysed Syngas is more efficient than direct combustion of the original biofuel more of the energy contained in the fuel is extracted Syngas may be burned directly in internal combustion engines turbines or high-temperature fuel cells The wood gas generator a wood-fueled gasification reactor can be connected to an internal combustion engine Syngas can be used to produce methanol dimethyl ether and hydrogen or converted via the Fischer Tropsch process to produce a diesel substitute or a mixture of alcohols that can be blended into gasoline Gasification normally relies on temperatures greater than C Lower-temperature gasification is desirable when co-producing biochar but results in syngas polluted with tar Solid edit Main article Solid fuel Biomass The term biofuels is also used for solid fuels that are made from biomass even though this is less common Research into other types edit Algae-based biofuels edit Main articles Algaculture and Algae fuel Algae can be produced in ponds or tanks on land and out at sea Algal fuels have high yields a high ignition point can be grown with minimal impact on fresh water resources can be produced using saline water and wastewater and are biodegradable and relatively harmless to the environment if spilled However production requires large amounts of energy and fertilizer the produced fuel degrades faster than other biofuels and it does not flow well in cold temperatures By due to economic considerations most efforts to produce fuel from algae have been abandoned or changed to other applications Third and fourth-generation biofuels also include biofuels that are produced by bioengineered organisms i e algae and cyanobacteria Algae and cyanobacteria will use water carbon dioxide and solar energy to produce biofuels This method of biofuel production is still at the research level The biofuels that are secreted by the bioengineered organisms are expected to have higher photon-to-fuel conversion efficiency compared to older generations of biofuels One of the advantages of this class of biofuels is that the cultivation of the organisms that produce the biofuels does not require the use of arable land The disadvantages include the cost of cultivating the biofuel-producing organisms being very high Recent research highlights that the transition to sustainable energy is reliant on the widespread adoption of third- and fourth-generation biofuels which utilize non-food sources such as algae and incorporate advanced processes like artificial photosynthesis These alternatives are essential for climate change mitigation because they significantly reduce the land-use competition and sustainability risks associated with earlier biofuel generations Electrofuels and solar fuels edit Electrofuels citation needed and solar fuels may or may not be biofuels depending on whether they contain biological elements Electrofuels are made by storing electrical energy in the chemical bonds of liquids and gases The primary targets are butanol biodiesel and hydrogen but include other alcohols and carbon-containing gases such as methane and butane A solar fuel is a synthetic chemical fuel produced from solar energy Light is converted to chemical energy typically by reducing protons to hydrogen or carbon dioxide to organic compounds Bio-digesters edit A bio-digester is a mechanized toilet that uses decomposition and sedimentation to turn human waste into a renewable fuel called biogas Biogas can be made from substances like agricultural waste and sewage The bio-digester uses a process called anaerobic digestion to produce biogas Anaerobic digestion uses a chemical process to break down organic matter with the use of microorganisms in the absence of oxygen to produce biogas The processes involved in anaerobic respiration are hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis and methanogenesis Extent of production and use edit Biofuel production by region Global biofuel production was Mtoe in which represented an annual increase of about compared to In the US was the largest biofuel producer in the world producing Mtoe followed by Brazil and South America at Mtoe and Europe mainly Germany at Mtoe An assessment from found that Biofuels will never be a major transport fuel as there is just not enough land in the world to grow plants to make biofuel for all vehicles It can however be part of an energy mix to take us into a future of renewable energy In worldwide biofuel production provided of the world s fuels for transport including a very small amount of aviation biofuel By worldwide biofuel production is expected to supply of the world s fuels for transport including of aviation fuel The US Europe Brazil and Indonesia are driving the majority of biofuel consumption growth This demand for biodiesel renewable diesel and biojet fuel is projected to increase by billion litres over - Issues edit Wheat fields in the USA wheat is grown for food but also for biofuel production This section is an excerpt from Issues relating to biofuels edit Issues relating to biofuel are social economic environmental and technical problems that may arise from biofuel production and use Social and economic issues include the food vs fuel debate and the need to develop responsible policies and economic instruments to ensure sustainable biofuel production Farming for biofuels feedstock can be detrimental to the environment if not done sustainably Environmental concerns include deforestation biodiversity loss and soil erosion as a result of land clearing for biofuels agriculture While biofuels can contribute to reduction in global carbon emissions indirect land use change for biofuel production can have the inverse effect Technical issues include possible modifications necessary to run the engine on biofuel as well as energy balance and efficiency The International Resource Panel outlined the wider and interrelated factors that need to be considered when deciding on the relative merits of pursuing one biofuel over another The IRP concluded that not all biofuels perform equally in terms of their effect on climate energy security and ecosystems and suggested that environmental and social effects need to be assessed throughout the entire life-cycle Environmental impacts edit Further information Sustainable biofuels Deforestation in Indonesia to make way for an oil palm plantation Estimates about the climate impact from biofuels vary widely based on the methodology and exact situation examined In general biofuels emit fewer greenhouse gas emissions when burned in an engine and are generally considered carbon-neutral fuels as the carbon they emit has been captured from the atmosphere by the crops used in biofuel production They can have greenhouse gas emissions ranging from as low as - gCO eq per MJ when carbon capture is incorporated into their production to those exceeding gCO eq per MJ when land-use change is significant Several factors are responsible for the variation in emission numbers of biofuel such as feedstock and its origin fuel production technique system boundary definitions and energy sources However many government policies such as those by the European Union and the UK require that biofuels have at least greenhouse gas emissions savings or if it is renewable fuels of non-biological origins relative to fossil fuels The growing demand for biofuels has raised concerns about land use and food security Many biofuel crops are grown on land that could otherwise be used for food production This shift in land use can lead to several problems Competition with Food Crops The cultivation of biofuels especially in food-insecure regions can drive up the cost of food and reduce the amount of land available for growing essential crops This can exacerbate global food insecurity especially in developing countries Deforestation and Habitat Loss To meet the increasing demand for biofuels large areas of forests and natural habitats are being cleared for agriculture This deforestation leads to the loss of biodiversity threatens wildlife species and disrupts ecosystems Biodiversity Loss edit The expansion of biofuel production particularly through monoculture farming growing a single crop on a large scale poses a significant threat to biodiversity Large-scale biofuel crop production can lead to Habitat Destruction The conversion of natural ecosystems into agricultural land can result in the loss of habitats for many plant and animal species leading to decreased biodiversity Soil Degradation Monoculture farming can deplete soil nutrients reduce soil fertility and increase the need for chemical inputs like fertilizers and pesticides which can further harm surrounding ecosystems Soil Fertility Continuous cultivation of biofuel crops without proper crop rotation or sustainable farming practices can lead to soil depletion Over time the soil may lose vital nutrients making it less suitable for farming Life-cycle assessments of first-generation biofuels have shown large emissions associated with the potential land-use change required to produce additional biofuel feedstocks If no land-use change is involved first-generation biofuels can on average have lower emissions than fossil fuels However biofuel production can compete with food crop production Up to of corn produced in the United States is used to make ethanol and worldwide of all grain is turned into biofuel A reduction in grain used for biofuels in the US and Europe would replace all of Ukraine s grain exports Several studies have shown that reductions in emissions from biofuels are achieved at the expense of other impacts such as acidification eutrophication water footprint and biodiversity loss Second-generation biofuels are thought to increase environmental sustainability since the non-food part of plants is being used to produce second-generation biofuels instead of being disposed of But the use of second-generation biofuels increases the competition for lignocellulosic biomass increasing the cost of these biofuels In theory third-generation biofuels produced from algae shouldn t harm the environment more than first- or second-generation biofuels due to lower changes in land use and the fact that they do not require pesticide use for production When looking at the data however it has been shown that the environmental cost to produce the infrastructure and energy required for third generation biofuel production are higher than the benefits provided from the biofuels use The European Commission has officially approved a measure to phase out palm oil -based biofuels by Unsustainable palm oil agriculture has caused significant environmental and social problems including deforestation and pollution The production of biofuels can be very energy intensive which if generated from non-renewable sources can heavily mitigate the benefits gained through biofuel use A solution proposed to solve this issue is to supply biofuel production facilities with excess nuclear energy which can supplement the power provided by fossil fuels This can provide a carbon inexpensive solution to help reduce the environmental impacts of biofuel production Indirect land use change impacts of biofuels edit This section is an excerpt from Indirect land use change impacts of biofuels edit This article needs to be updated Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information August Brazilian cerrado Amazon rainforest The indirect land use change impacts of biofuels also known as ILUC or iLUC pronounced as i-luck relates to the unintended consequence of releasing more carbon emissions due to land-use changes around the world induced by the expansion of croplands for ethanol or biodiesel production in response to the increased global demand for biofuels As farmers worldwide respond to higher crop prices in order to maintain the global food supply-and-demand balance pristine lands are cleared to replace the food crops that were diverted elsewhere to biofuels production Because natural lands such as rainforests and grasslands store carbon in their soil and biomass as plants grow each year clearance of wilderness for new farms translates to a net increase in greenhouse gas emissions Due to this off-site change in the carbon stock of the soil and the biomass indirect land use change has consequences in the greenhouse gas GHG balance of a biofuel Other authors have also argued that indirect land use changes produce other

Rapid transit Personal rapid transit Category Renewable energy portal v t e Biogas is a gaseous renewable energy source produced from raw materials such as agricultural waste manure municipal waste plant material sewage green waste wastewater and food waste Biogas is produced by anaerobic digestion with anaerobic organisms or methanogens inside an anaerobic digester biodigester or a bioreactor The gas composition is primarily methane CH and carbon dioxide CO and may have small amounts of hydrogen sulfide H S moisture and siloxanes The methane can be combusted or oxidized with oxygen This energy release allows biogas to be used as a fuel it can be used in fuel cells and for heating purpose such as in cooking It can also be used in a gas engine to convert the energy in the gas into electricity and heat Biogas can be upgraded to natural gas quality specifications by stripping carbon dioxide and other contaminants Biogas that has been upgraded to interchangeability with natural gas is called Renewable Natural Gas RNG RNG can be used a drop-in fuel in the gas grid or to produce compressed natural gas as a vehicle fuel Biogas is considered to be a renewable resource At a high level biogas is a carbon neutral fuel in so far as emissions of carbon dioxide from its combustion are matched by carbon dioxide pulled from the atmosphere to produce biomass In practice the carbon intensity of biogas can vary depending on emissions from the production of biomass and the processes used to produce and upgrade biogas In some applications the capturing of biogas can avoid emissions of methane reducing overall emissions Production edit Biogas is produced by microorganisms such as methanogens and sulfate-reducing bacteria performing anaerobic respiration Biogas can refer to gas produced naturally and industrially Natural edit See also Marsh gas In soil methane is produced in anaerobic environments by methanogens but is mostly consumed in aerobic zones by methanotrophs Methane emissions result when the balance favors methanogens Wetland soils are the main natural source of methane Other sources include oceans forest soils termites and wild ruminants Industrial edit Main article Anaerobic digestion Anaerobic digestion is a sequence of processes by which microorganisms break down biodegradable material in the absence of oxygen This process produces biogas which can be used as a fuel Industrial biogas production can either be purpose-built such as anaerobic digesters built to process manure and organic waste or can harvest biogas produced as byproduct from landfills or wastewater treatment plants Biogas plants edit A biogas plant is the name often given to an anaerobic digester that treats farm wastes municipal organic waste and or energy crops Industrial biogas plants process organic material in an air-tight tank to create anaerobic conditions The material is heated to either mesothermic o C or thermophilic o C and held for a typical retention time of two to thirty days These plants can be fed with energy crops such as maize silage or biodegradable wastes including sewage sludge and food waste During the process the micro-organisms transform biomass waste into biogas and digestate Higher quantities of biogas can be produced when the wastewater is co-digested with other residuals from the dairy industry sugar industry or brewery industry For example while mixing of wastewater from beer factory with cow whey the production of biogas was increased by times compared to the biogas produced by wastewater from the brewery only Landfill gas edit Main article Landfill gas An Indonesian community installs a cylindrical plastic biogas reactor in order to turn their organic waste into energy Landfill gas is produced by wet organic waste decomposing under anaerobic conditions in a similar way to biogas The waste is covered and mechanically compressed by the weight of the material that is deposited above This material prevents oxygen exposure thus allowing anaerobic microbes to thrive Biogas builds up and is slowly released into the atmosphere if the site has not been engineered to capture the gas Landfill gas released in an uncontrolled way can be hazardous since it can become explosive when it escapes from the landfill and mixes with oxygen The lower explosive limit is methane and the upper is methane The methane in biogas is times more potent a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide Therefore uncontained landfill gas which escapes into the atmosphere may significantly contribute to the effects of global warming In addition volatile organic compounds VOCs in landfill gas contribute to the formation of photochemical smog Dangers edit The air pollution produced by biogas is similar to that of natural gas as when methane a major constituent of biogas is ignited for its usage as an energy source Carbon dioxide is made as a product which is a greenhouse gas as described by this equation CH O CO H O The content of toxic hydrogen sulfide presents additional risks and has been responsible for serious accidents Leaks of unburned methane are an additional risk because methane is a potent greenhouse gas A facility may leak of the methane Biogas can be explosive when mixed in the ratio of one part biogas to parts air Special safety precautions have to be taken for entering an empty biogas digester for maintenance work It is important that a biogas system never has negative pressure as this could cause an explosion Negative gas pressure can occur if too much gas is removed or leaked Because of this biogas should not be used at pressures below one column inch of water measured by a pressure gauge citation needed Frequent smell checks must be performed on a biogas system If biogas is smelled anywhere windows and doors should be opened immediately If there is a fire the gas should be shut off at the gate valve of the biogas system Composition edit Typical composition of biogas Compound Formula Percentage by volume Methane CH Carbon dioxide CO Nitrogen N Hydrogen H Hydrogen sulfide H S Oxygen O Source www kolumbus fi The composition of biogas varies depending upon the substrate composition as well as the conditions within the anaerobic reactor temperature pH and substrate concentration Landfill gas typically has methane concentrations around Advanced waste treatment technologies can produce biogas with methane which for reactors with free liquids can be increased to methane using in-situ gas purification techniques As produced biogas contains water vapor The fractional volume of water vapor is a function of biogas temperature correction of measured gas volume for water vapour content and thermal expansion is easily done via simple mathematics which yields the standardized volume of dry biogas For kg wet weight of input to a typical biodigester total solids may be of the wet weight while volatile suspended solids may be of the total solids Protein would be of the volatile solids carbohydrates would be of the volatile solids and finally fats would be of the volatile solids Biochemical oxygen demand BOD is a measure of the amount of oxygen required by aerobic micro-organisms to decompose the organic matter in a sample of material being used in the biodigester as well as the BOD for the liquid discharge allows for the calculation of the daily energy output from a biodigester Contaminants edit Sulfur compounds edit Toxic corrosive and foul smelling hydrogen sulfide H S is the most common contaminant in biogas If not separated combustion will produce sulfur dioxide SO and sulfuric acid H SO which are corrosive and environmentally hazardous Other sulfur-containing compounds such as thiols may be present Ammonia edit Ammonia NH is produced from organic compounds containing nitrogen such as the amino acids in proteins If not separated from the biogas combustion results in NO x emissions Siloxanes edit In some cases biogas contains siloxanes They are formed from the anaerobic decomposition of materials commonly found in soaps and detergents During combustion of biogas containing siloxanes silicon is released and can combine with free oxygen or other elements in the combustion gas Deposits are formed containing mostly silica SiO or silicates Si x O y and can contain calcium sulfur zinc phosphorus Such white mineral deposits accumulate to a surface thickness of several millimeters and must be removed by chemical or mechanical means Debate edit Part of a series on Renewable energy Biofuel Biogas Biomass

country and territory Marketing and policy trends v t e Arguments in favor edit High levels of methane are produced when manure is stored under anaerobic conditions During storage and when manure has been applied to the land nitrous oxide is also produced as a byproduct of the denitrification process Nitrous oxide N O is times more aggressive as a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide and methane times more than carbon dioxide By converting cow manure into methane biogas via anaerobic digestion the millions of cattle in the United States would be able to produce billion kilowatt hours of electricity enough to power millions of homes across the United States One cow can produce enough manure in one day to generate kilowatt hours of electricity Furthermore by converting cattle manure into methane biogas instead of letting it decompose global warming gases could be reduced by million metric tons or Arguments against edit Others environmental groups have argued that manure based biogases are a form of greenwashing They argue it encourages and subsidies the use of concentrated animal feeding operations and emits other pollutants such as hydrogen sulfide In US senators including Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren argued biogas would not be able to succeed without taxpayer dollars and that those would be better used on other methods They also argued that they may accelerate consolidation in the industry and see farms expand their size specifically to be large enough to receive biogas subsidies They point to evidence farmers did this following California s rollout of biogas incentive programs Others have argued the level of funding to biogas is already particularly outsized For instance in Wisconsin just two years of spending on biogas has been higher than years of spending on solar energy Manufacturing of biogas from intentionally planted maize has been described as being unsustainable and harmful due to very concentrated intense and soil eroding character of these plantations Applications edit A biogas bus in Link ping Sweden Biogas can be used for electricity production on sewage works in a CHP gas engine where the waste heat from the engine is conveniently used for heating the digester cooking space heating water heating and process heating If compressed it can replace compressed natural gas for use in vehicles where it can fuel an internal combustion engine or fuel cells and is a much more effective displacer of carbon dioxide than the normal use in on-site CHP plants Biogas upgrading edit Raw biogas produced from digestion is roughly methane and CO with trace elements of H S inadequate for use in machinery The corrosive nature of H S alone is enough to destroy the mechanisms Methane in biogas can be concentrated via a biogas upgrader to the same standards as fossil natural gas which itself has to go through a cleaning process and becomes biomethane If the local gas network allows the producer of the biogas may use their distribution networks Gas must be very clean to reach pipeline quality and must be of the correct composition for the distribution network to accept Carbon dioxide water hydrogen sulfide and particulates must be removed if present There are four main methods of upgrading water washing pressure swing absorption selexol absorption and amine gas treating In addition to these the use of membrane separation technology for biogas upgrading is increasing and there are already several plants operating in Europe and USA The most prevalent method is water washing where high pressure gas flows into a column where the carbon dioxide and other trace elements are scrubbed by cascading water running counter-flow to the gas This arrangement could deliver methane with manufacturers guaranteeing maximum methane loss in the system It takes roughly between and of the total energy output in gas to run a biogas upgrading system Biogas gas-grid injection edit Gas-grid injection is the injection of biogas into the methane grid natural gas grid is possible if biogas is upgraded to biomethane Until the breakthrough of micro combined heat and power two-thirds of all the energy produced by biogas power plants was lost as heat Using the grid to transport the gas to consumers the energy can be used for on-site generation resulting in a reduction of losses in the transportation of energy Typical energy losses in natural gas transmission systems range from to in electricity transmission they range from to Before being injected in the gas grid biogas passes a cleaning process during which it is upgraded to natural gas quality During the cleaning process trace components harmful to the gas grid and the final users are removed Biogas in transport edit Biogast get Amanda Amanda the Biogas Train train near Link ping station Sweden If concentrated and compressed it can be used in vehicle transportation Compressed biogas is becoming widely used in Sweden Switzerland and Germany A biogas-powered train named Biogast get Amanda The Biogas Train Amanda has been in service in Sweden since Biogas powers automobiles In a British documentary film titled Sweet as a Nut detailed the biogas production process from pig manure and showed how it fueled a custom-adapted combustion engine In an estimated vehicles were being fueled with upgraded biogas worldwide mostly in Europe Biogas is part of the wet gas and condensing gas or air category that includes mist or fog in the gas stream The mist or fog is predominately water vapor that condenses on the sides of pipes or stacks throughout the gas flow Biogas environments include wastewater digesters landfills and animal feeding operations covered livestock lagoons Ultrasonic flow meters are one of the few devices capable of measuring in a biogas atmosphere Most of thermal flow meters are unable to provide reliable data because the moisture causes steady high flow readings and continuous flow spiking although there are single-point insertion thermal mass flow meters capable of accurately monitoring biogas flows with minimal pressure drop They can handle moisture variations that occur in the flow stream because of daily and seasonal temperature fluctuations and account for the moisture in the flow stream to produce a dry gas value Biogas generated heat electricity edit Biogas can be used in different types of internal combustion engines such as the Jenbacher or Caterpillar gas engines Other internal combustion engines such as gas turbines are suitable for the conversion of biogas into both electricity and heat The digestate is the remaining inorganic matter that was not transformed into biogas It can be used as an agricultural fertiliser Biogas can be used as the fuel in the system of producing biogas from agricultural wastes and co-generating heat and electricity in a combined heat and power CHP plant Unlike the other green energy such as wind and solar the biogas can be quickly accessed on demand The global warming potential can also be greatly reduced when using biogas as the fuel instead of fossil fuel However the acidification and eutrophication potentials produced by biogas are and times higher respectively than fossil fuel alternatives This impact can be reduced by using correct combination of feedstocks covered storage for digesters and improved techniques for retrieving escaped material Overall the results still suggest that using biogas can lead to significant reduction in most impacts compared to fossil fuel alternative The balance between environmental damage and green house gas emission should still be considered while implicating the system Technological advancements edit Projects such as NANOCLEAN are nowadays developing new ways to produce biogas more efficiently using iron oxide nanoparticles in the processes of organic waste treatment This process can triple the production of biogas Wastewater Treatment edit Faecal Sludge is a product of onsite sanitation systems Post collection and transportation Faecal sludge can be treated with sewage in a conventional treatment plant or otherwise it can be treated independently in a faecal sludge treatment plant Faecal sludge can also be co-treated with organic solid waste in composting or in an anaerobic digestion system Biogas can be generated through anaerobic digestion in the treatment of faecal sludge The appropriate management of excreta and its valorisation through the production of biogas from faecal sludge helps mitigate the effects of poorly managed excreta such as waterborne diseases and water and environmental pollution The Resource Recovery and Reuse is a subprogram of the CGIAR Research Program on Water Land and Ecosystems dedicated to applied research on the safe recovery of water nutrients and energy from domestic and agro-industrial waste streams They believe using waste as energy would be good financially and would tackle sanitation health and environmental issues Legislation edit European Union edit The European Union has legislation regarding waste management and landfill sites called the Landfill Directive Countries such as the United Kingdom and Germany now have legislation in force that provides farmers with long-term revenue and energy security The EU mandates that internal combustion engines with biogas have ample gas pressure to optimize combustion and within the European Union ATEX centrifugal fan units built in accordance with the European directive EU previously EG are obligatory These centrifugal fan units for example Combimac Meidinger AG or Witt Sohn AG are suitable for use in Zone and United States edit The United States legislates against landfill gas as it contains VOCs The United States Clean Air Act and Title of the Code of Federal Regulations CFR requires landfill owners to estimate the quantity of non-methane organic compounds NMOCs emitted If the estimated NMOC emissions exceeds tonnes per year the landfill owner is required to collect the gas and treat it to remove the entrained NMOCs That usually means burning it Because of the remoteness of landfill sites it is sometimes not economically feasible to produce electricity from the gas There are a variety of grants and loans the support the development of anaerobic digestor systems The Rural Energy for American Program provides loan financing and grant funding for biogas systems as does the Environmental Quality Incentives Program Conservation Stewardship Program and Conservation Loan Program Global developments edit United States edit With the many benefits of biogas it is starting to become a popular source of energy and is starting to be used in the United States more In the United States consumed TWh trillion BTU of energy from landfill gas about of the total U S natural gas consumption Methane biogas derived from cow manure is being tested in the U S According to a study collected by the Science and Children magazine methane biogas from cow manure would be sufficient to produce billion kilowatt hours enough to power millions of homes across America Furthermore methane biogas has been tested to prove that it can reduce million metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions or about of the greenhouse gases produced by the United States The number of farm-based digesters increased by in according to the American Biogas Council In Vermont biogas generated on dairy farms was included in the CVPS Cow Power program The program was originally offered by Central Vermont Public Service Corporation as a voluntary tariff and now with a recent merger with Green Mountain Power is now the GMP Cow Power Program Customers can elect to pay a premium on their electric bill and that premium is passed directly to the farms in the program In Sheldon Vermont Green Mountain Dairy has provided renewable energy as part of the Cow Power program It started when the brothers who own the farm Bill and Brian Rowell wanted to address some of the manure management challenges faced by dairy farms including manure odor and nutrient availability for the crops they need to grow to feed the animals They installed an anaerobic digester to process the cow and milking center waste from their cows to produce renewable energy a bedding to replace sawdust and a plant-friendly fertilizer The energy and environmental attributes are sold to the GMP Cow Power program On average the system run by the Rowells produces enough electricity to power to other homes The generator capacity is about kilowatts In Hereford Texas cow manure is being used to power an ethanol power plant By switching to methane biogas the ethanol power plant has saved barrels of oil a day Over all the power plant has reduced transportation costs and will be opening many more jobs for future power plants that will rely on biogas In Oakley Kansas an ethanol plant considered to be one of the largest biogas facilities in North America is using integrated manure utilization system to produce heat for its boilers by utilizing feedlot manure municipal organics and ethanol plant waste At full capacity the plant is expected to replace of the fossil fuel used in the manufacturing process of ethanol and methanol In California the Southern California Gas Company has advocated for mixing biogas into existing natural gas pipelines However California state officials have taken the position that biogas is better used in hard-to-electrify sectors of the economy-- like aviation heavy industry and long-haul trucking Europe edit Biogas fueling station in Mikkeli Finland The level of development varies greatly in Europe While countries such as Germany Austria Sweden and Italy are fairly advanced in their use of biogas there is a vast potential for this renewable energy source in the rest of the continent especially in Eastern Europe MT-Energie is a German biogas technology company operating in the field of renewable energies Different legal frameworks education schemes and the availability of technology are among the prime reasons behind this untapped potential Another challenge for the further progression of biogas has been negative public perception In February the European Biogas Association EBA was founded in Brussels as a non-profit organisation to promote the deployment of sustainable biogas production and use in Europe EBA s strategy defines three priorities establish biogas as an important part of Europe s energy mix promote source separation of household waste to increase the gas potential and support the production of biomethane as vehicle fuel In July it had members from countries across Europe UK edit As of September update there are about non-sewage biogas plants in the UK Most are on-farm and some larger facilities exist off-farm which are taking food and consumer wastes On October biogas was injected into the UK gas grid for the first time Sewage from over Oxfordshire homes is sent to Didcot sewage treatment works where it is treated in an anaerobic digestor to produce biogas which is then cleaned to provide gas for approximately homes In the Green-Energy company Ecotricity announced their plans to build three grid-injecting digesters Italy edit In Italy the biogas industry first started in thanks to the introduction of advantageous feed tariffs They were later replaced by feed-in premiums and the preference was given to by products and farming waste and leading to stagnation in biogas production and derived heat and electricity since As of September update in Italy there are more than biogas plants with a production of about GW Germany edit Germany is Europe s biggest biogas producer and the market leader in biogas technology In there were biogas plants operating throughout the country Lower Saxony Bavaria and the eastern federal states are the main regions Most of these plants are employed as power plants Usually the biogas plants are directly connected with a CHP which produces electric power by burning the bio methane The electrical power is then fed into the public power grid In the total installed electrical capacity of these power plants was MW The electricity supply was approximately TWh which is of the total generated renewable electricity Biogas in Germany is primarily extracted by the co-fermentation of energy crops called NawaRo an abbreviation of nachwachsende Rohstoffe German for renewable resources mixed with manure The main crop used is corn Organic waste and industrial and agricultural residues such as waste from the food industry are also used for biogas generation In this respect biogas production in Germany differs significantly from the UK where biogas generated from landfill sites is most common Biogas production in Germany has developed rapidly over the last years The main reason is the legally created frameworks Government support of renewable energy started in with the Electricity Feed-in Act StrEG This law guaranteed the producers of energy from renewable sources the feed into the public power grid thus the power companies were forced to take all produced energy from independent private producers of green energy In the Electricity Feed-in Act was replaced by the Renewable Energy Sources Act EEG This law even guaranteed a fixed compensation for the produced electric power over years The amount of around kWh gave farmers the opportunity to become energy suppliers and gain a further source of income The German agricultural biogas production was given a further push in by implementing the so-called NawaRo-Bonus This is a special payment given for the use of renewable resources that is energy crops In the German government stressed its intention to invest further effort and support in improving the renewable energy supply to provide an answer on growing climate challenges and increasing oil prices by the Integrated Climate and Energy Programme This continual trend of renewable energy promotion induces a number of challenges facing the management and organisation of renewable energy supply that has also several impacts on the biogas production The first challenge to be noticed is the high area-consuming of the biogas electric power supply In energy crops for biogas production consumed an area of circa ha in Germany This high demand of agricultural areas generates new competitions with the food industries that did not exist hitherto Moreover new industries and markets were created in predominately rural regions entailing different new players with an economic political and civil background Their influence and acting has to be governed to gain all advantages this new source of energy is offering Finally biogas will furthermore play an important role in the German renewable energy supply if good governance is focused Developing countries edit Domestic biogas plants convert livestock manure and night soil into biogas and slurry the fermented manure This technology is feasible for small-holders with livestock producing kg manure per day an equivalent of about pigs or cows This manure has to be collectable to mix it with water and feed it into the plant Toilets can be connected Another precondition is the temperature that affects the fermentation process With an optimum at C the technology especially applies for those living in a sub tropical climate This makes the technology for small holders in developing countries often suitable Depending on size and location a typical brick made fixed dome biogas plant can be installed at the yard of a rural household with the investment between US to in Asian countries and up to in the African context A high quality biogas plant needs minimum maintenance costs and can produce gas for at least years without major problems and re-investments For the user biogas provides clean cooking energy reduces indoor air pollution and reduces the time needed for traditional biomass collection especially for women and children The slurry is a clean organic fertilizer that potentially increases agricultural productivity In developing countries it was also determined that the use of biogas leads to a reduction in GHG emissions compared with GHG emissions due to firewood Moreover GHG emissions of kg CO equivalent per year per animal could be prevented Energy is an important part of modern society and can serve as one of the most important indicators of socio-economic development As much as there have been advancements in technology even so some three billion people primarily in the rural areas of developing countries continue to access their energy needs for cooking through traditional means by burning biomass resources like firewood crop residues and animal dung in crude traditional stoves Domestic biogas technology is a proven and established technology in many parts of the world especially Asia Several countries in this region have embarked on large-scale programmes on domestic biogas such as China and India Inauguration of a S dzucker biogas plant in Drochia with interview of Octavian Arma u The Netherlands Development Organisation SNV supports national programmes on domestic biogas that aim to establish commercial-viable domestic biogas sectors in which local companies market install and service biogas plants for households In Asia SNV is working in Nepal Vietnam Bangladesh Bhutan Cambodia Lao PDR Pakistan and Indonesia and in Africa Rwanda Senegal Burkina Faso Ethiopia Tanzania Uganda Kenya Benin and Cameroon In South Africa a prebuilt Biogas system is manufactured and sold One key feature is that installation requires less skill and is quicker to install as the digester tank is premade plastic India edit Biogas in India has been traditionally based on dairy manure as feed stock and these gobar gas plants have been in operation for a long period of time especially in rural India In the last decades research organisations with a focus on rural energy security have enhanced the design of the systems resulting in newer efficient low cost designs such as the Deenabandhu model The Deenabandhu Model is a new biogas-production model popular in India Deenabandhu means friend of the helpless The unit usually has a capacity of to cubic metres It is constructed using bricks or by a ferrocement mixture In India the brick model costs slightly more than the ferrocement model however India s Ministry of New and Renewable Energy offers some subsidy per model constructed Biogas which is mainly methane natural gas can also be used for generating protein rich cattle poultry and fish feed in villages economically by cultivating Methylococcus capsulatus bacteria culture with tiny land and water foot print The carbon dioxide gas produced as by product from these plants can be put to use in cheaper production of algae oil or spirulina from algaculture particularly in tropical countries like India which can displace the prime position of crude oil in near future Union government of India is implementing many schemes to utilise productively the agro waste or biomass in rural areas to uplift rural economy and job potential With these plants the non-edible biomass or waste of edible biomass is converted in to high value products without any water pollution or green house gas GHG emissions LPG Liquefied Petroleum Gas is a key source of cooking fuel in urban India and its prices have been increasing along with the global fuel prices Also the heavy subsidies provided by the successive governments in promoting LPG as a domestic cooking fuel has become a financial burden renewing the focus on biogas as a cooking fuel alternative in urban establishments This has led to the development of prefabricated digester for modular deployments as compared to RCC and cement structures which take a longer duration to construct Renewed focus on process technology like the Biourja process model has enhanced the stature of medium and large scale anaerobic digester in India as a potential alternative to LPG as primary cooking fuel In India Nepal Pakistan and Bangladesh biogas produced from the anaerobic digestion of manure in small-scale digestion facilities is called gobar gas it is estimated that such facilities exist in over million households in India in Bangladesh and thousands in Pakistan particularly North Punjab due to the thriving population of livestock The digester is an airtight circular pit made of concrete with a pipe connection The manure is directed to the pit usually straight from the cattle shed The pit is filled with a required quantity of wastewater The gas pipe is connected to the kitchen fireplace through control valves The combustion of this biogas has very little odour or smoke Owing to simplicity in implementation and use of cheap raw materials in villages it is one of the most environmentally sound energy sources for rural needs One type of these system is the Sintex Digester Some designs use vermiculture to further enhance the slurry produced by the biogas plant for use as compost In Pakistan the Rural Support Programmes Network is running the Pakistan Domestic Biogas Programme which has installed biogas plants and has trained in excess of masons on the technology and aims to develop the Biogas Sector in Pakistan In Nepal the government provides subsidies to build biogas plant at home China edit As of at least China is both the world s largest producer and largest consumer of household biogas The Chinese have experimented with the applications of biogas since Around China had installed digesters in an effort to make agriculture more efficient During the last few years technology has met high growth rates This seems to be the earliest developments in generating biogas from agricultural waste The rural biogas construction in China has shown an increased development trend The exponential growth of energy supply caused by rapid economic development and severe haze condition in China have led biogas to become the better eco-friendly energy for the rural areas In Qing county Hebei Province the technology of using crop straw as a main material to generate biogas is currently developing China had million biogas plants with an output of billion cubic meter biogas until The annual biogas output has increased to billion cubic meter in The Chinese government had supported and funded rural biogas projects As of more than million rural Chinese households use biogas digesters During the winter the biogas production in northern regions of China is lower This is caused by the lack of heat control technology for digesters thus the co-digestion of different feedstock failed to complete in the cold environment Zambia edit Lusaka the capital city of Zambia has two million inhabitants with over half of the population residing in peri-urban areas The majority of this population use pit latrines as toilets generating approximately tons of fecal sludge per annum This sludge is inadequately managed Over of the generated faecal sludge remains within the residential environment thereby compromising both the environment and public health In the face of research work and implementation of biogas having started as early as in the s Zambia is lagging behind in the adoption and use of biogas in the sub-Saharan Africa Animal manure and crop residues are required for the provision of energy for cooking and lighting Inadequate funding absence of policy regulatory framework and strategies on biogas unfavorable investor monetary policy inadequate expertise lack of awareness of the benefits of biogas technology among leaders financial institutions and locals resistance to change due cultural and traditions of the locals high installation and maintenance costs of biogas digesters inadequate research and development improper management and lack of monitoring of installed digesters complexity of the carbon market lack of incentives and social equity are among the challenges that have impeded the acquiring and sustainable implementation of domestic biogas production in Zambia Associations edit

    "content": "Carbon-neutral fuel - Wikipedia Jump to content From Wikipedia the free encyclopedia Type of fuel which have no net greenhouse gas emissions Carbon-neutral fuel is fuel which produces no net- greenhouse gas emissions or carbon footprint In practice this usually means fuels that are made using carbon dioxide CO as a feedstock Proposed carbon-neutral fuels can broadly be grouped into synthetic fuels which are made by chemically hydrogenating carbon dioxide and biofuels which are produced using natural CO -consuming processes like photosynthesis The carbon dioxide used to make synthetic fuels may be directly captured from the air recycled from power plant flue exhaust gas or derived from carbonic acid in seawater Common examples of synthetic fuels include ammonia and methane although more complex hydrocarbons such as gasoline and jet fuel have also been successfully synthesized artificially In addition to being carbon neutral such renewable fuels can alleviate the costs and dependency issues of imported fossil fuels without requiring either electrification of the vehicle fleet or conversion to hydrogen or other fuels enabling continued compatible and affordable vehicles In order to be truly carbon-neutral any energy required for the process must be itself be carbon-neutral or emissions-free like renewable energy or nuclear energy If the combustion of carbon-neutral fuels is subject to carbon capture at the flue they result in net- negative carbon dioxide emission and may thus constitute a form of greenhouse gas remediation Negative emissions are widely considered an indispensable component of efforts to limit global warming although negative emissions technologies are currently not economically viable for private sector companies Carbon credits are likely to play an important role for carbon-negative fuels Production of synthetic hydrocarbons edit Part of a series on Sustainable energy Energy conservation Arcology Building insulation

behaviour Diet Living Tourism Portal Glossary Index v t e Synthetic hydrocarbons can be produced in chemical reactions between carbon dioxide which can be captured from power plants or the air and hydrogen The fuel often referred to as electrofuel stores the energy that was used in the production of the hydrogen Hydrogen fuel is typically prepared by the electrolysis of water in a power to gas process To minimize emissions the electricity is produced using a low-emission energy source such as wind solar or nuclear power Through the Sabatier reaction methane can then be produced which may then be stored to be burned later in power plants as a synthetic natural gas transported by pipeline truck or tanker ship or be used in gas to liquids processes such as the Fischer Tropsch process to make traditional fuels for transportation or heating There are a few more fuels that can be created using hydrogen Formic acid for example can be made by reacting the hydrogen with CO Formic acid combined with CO can form isobutanol Methanol can be made from a chemical reaction of a carbon-dioxide molecule with three hydrogen molecules to produce methanol and water The stored energy can be recovered by burning the methanol in a combustion engine releasing carbon dioxide water and heat Methane can be produced in a similar reaction Special precautions against methane leaks are important since methane is nearly times as potent as CO regarding the -year global warming potential More energy can be used to combine methanol or methane into larger hydrocarbon fuel molecules Researchers have also suggested using methanol to produce dimethyl ether This fuel could be used as a substitute for diesel fuel due to its ability to self ignite under high pressure and temperature It is already being used in some areas for heating and energy generation It is nontoxic but must be stored under pressure Larger hydrocarbons and ethanol can also be produced from carbon dioxide and hydrogen All synthetic hydrocarbons are generally produced at temperatures of C and at pressures of to bar Catalysts are usually used to improve the efficiency of the reaction and create the desired type of hydrocarbon fuel Such reactions are exothermic and use about mol of hydrogen per mole of carbon dioxide involved They also produce large amounts of water as a byproduct Sources of carbon for recycling edit The most economical source of carbon for recycling into fuel is flue-gas emissions from fossil-fuel combustion where it can be obtained for about US per ton However this is not carbon-neutral since the carbon is of fossil origin therefore moving carbon from the geosphere to the atmosphere Since carbonic acid in seawater is in chemical equilibrium with atmospheric carbon dioxide extraction of carbon from seawater has been studied Researchers have estimated that carbon extraction from seawater would cost about per ton Carbon capture from ambient air is more costly at between and per ton and is considered impractical for fuel synthesis or carbon sequestration Direct air capture is less developed than other methods Proposals for this method involve using a caustic chemical to react with carbon dioxide in the air to produce carbonates These can then be broken down and hydrated to release pure CO gas and regenerate the caustic chemical This process requires more energy than other methods because carbon dioxide is at much lower concentrations in the atmosphere than in other sources Researchers have also suggested using biomass as a carbon source for fuel production Adding hydrogen to the biomass would reduce its carbon to produce fuel This method has the advantage of using plant matter to cheaply capture carbon dioxide The plants also add some chemical energy to the fuel from biological molecules This may be a more efficient use of biomass than conventional biofuel because it uses most of the carbon and chemical energy from the biomass instead of releasing as much energy and carbon Its main disadvantage is as with conventional ethanol production it competes with food production Renewable and nuclear energy costs edit Nighttime wind power is considered the most economical form of electrical power with which to synthesize fuel because the load curve for electricity peaks sharply during the warmest hours of the day but wind tends to blow slightly more at night than during the day Therefore the price of nighttime wind power is often much less expensive than any alternative Off-peak wind power prices in high wind penetration areas of the U S averaged cents per kilowatt-hour in but only cents kWh during the least expensive six hours of the day Typically wholesale electricity costs to cents kWh during the day Commercial fuel synthesis companies suggest they can produce gasoline for less than petroleum fuels when oil costs more than per barrel In a team of process chemists led by Heather Willauer of the U S Navy estimates that megawatts of electricity can produce cubic metres US gal of jet fuel per day and shipboard production from nuclear power would cost about per cubic metre US gal While that was about twice the petroleum fuel cost in it is expected to be much less than the market price in less than five years if recent trends continue needs update Moreover since the delivery of fuel to a carrier battle group costs about per cubic metre US gal shipboard production is already much less expensive Willauer said seawater is the best option for a source of synthetic jet fuel By April Willauer s team had not yet made fuel to the standard required by military jets but they were able in September to use the fuel to fly a radio-controlled model airplane powered by a common two-stroke internal combustion engine Because the process requires a large input of electrical energy a plausible first step of implementation would be for American nuclear-powered aircraft carriers the Nimitz-class and the Gerald R Ford-class to manufacture their own jet fuel The U S Navy is expected to deploy the technology some time in the s In a study published by the NATO Energy Security Centre of Excellence concluded that e-fuels offer one of the most promising decarbonization pathways for military mobility across the land sea and air domains Demonstration projects and commercial development edit A kilowatt methane synthesis plant was constructed by the Center for Solar Energy and Hydrogen Research ZSW at Baden-W rttemberg and the Fraunhofer Society in Germany and began operating in It is being upgraded to megawatts scheduled for completion in autumn The George Olah carbon dioxide recycling plant named after George Andrew Olah operated by Carbon Recycling International in Grindav k Iceland has been producing million liters of methanol transportation fuel per year from flue exhaust of the Svartsengi Power Station since It has the capacity to produce million liters per year Audi has constructed a carbon-neutral liquefied natural gas LNG plant in Werlte Germany The plant is intended to produce transportation fuel to offset LNG used in their A Sportback g-tron automobiles and can keep metric tons of CO out of the environment per year at its initial capacity Zero a British-based company set up by former F engineer Paddy Lowe has developed a process it terms petrosynthesis to develop synthetic fuels from atmospheric carbon dioxide and water using renewable energy In it began work on a demonstration production plant at Bicester Heritage near Oxford Commercial developments are taking place in Columbia South Carolina Camarillo California and Darlington England A demonstration project in Berkeley California proposes synthesizing both fuels and food oils from recovered flue gases Greenhouse gas remediation edit Carbon-neutral fuels can lead to greenhouse gas remediation because carbon dioxide gas would be reused to produce fuel instead of being released into the atmosphere Capturing the carbon dioxide in flue gas emissions from power plants would eliminate their greenhouse gas emissions although burning the fuel in vehicles would release that carbon because there is no economical way to capture those emissions This approach would reduce net carbon dioxide emission by about if it were used on all fossil fuel power plants Most coal and natural gas power plants have been predicted to be economically retrofittable with carbon dioxide scrubbers for carbon capture to recycle flue exhaust or for carbon sequestration Such recycling is expected to not only cost less than the excess economic impacts of climate change if it were not done but also to pay for itself as global fuel demand growth and peak oil shortages increase the price of petroleum and fungible natural gas Capturing CO directly from the air known as direct air capture or extracting carbonic acid from seawater would also reduce the amount of carbon dioxide in the environment and create a closed cycle of carbon to eliminate new carbon dioxide emissions Use of these methods would eliminate the need for fossil fuels entirely assuming that enough renewable energy could be generated to produce the fuel Using synthetic hydrocarbons to produce synthetic materials such as plastics could result in permanent sequestration of carbon from the atmosphere Technologies edit Traditional fuels methanol or ethanol edit See also Methanol economy Some authorities have recommended producing methanol instead of traditional transportation fuels It is a liquid at normal temperatures and can be toxic if ingested Methanol has a higher octane rating than gasoline but a lower energy density and can be mixed with other fuels or used on its own It may also be used in the production of more complex hydrocarbons and polymers Direct methanol fuel cells have been developed by Caltech s Jet Propulsion Laboratory to convert methanol and oxygen into electricity It is possible to convert methanol into gasoline jet fuel or other hydrocarbons but that requires additional energy and more complex production facilities Methanol is slightly more corrosive than traditional fuels requiring automobile modifications on the order of US each to use it In a method using carbon spikes copper nanoparticles and nitrogen that converts carbon dioxide to ethanol was developed Microalgae edit Main article Microalgae This section s factual accuracy is disputed Relevant discussion may be found on the talk page Please help to ensure that disputed statements are reliably sourced February Learn how and when to remove this message Fuel made from microalgae could potentially have a low carbon footprint and is an active area of research although no large-scale production system has been commercialized to date Microalgae are aquatic unicellular organisms Although they unlike most plants have extremely simple cell structures they are still photoautotrophic able to use solar energy to convert carbon dioxide into carbohydrates and fats via photosynthesis These compounds can serve as raw materials for biofuels like bioethanol or biodiesel Therefore even though combusting microalgae-based fuel for energy would still produce emissions like any other fuel it could be close to carbon-neutral if they as a whole consumed as much carbon dioxide as is emitted during combustion The advantages of microalgae are their higher CO -fixation efficiency compared to most plants and their ability to thrive in a wide variety of aquatic habitats Their main disadvantage is their high cost It has been argued that their unique and highly variable chemical compositions may make it attractive for specific applications Microalgae also can be used as livestock feed due to their proteins Even more some species of microalgae produce valuable compounds such as pigments and pharmaceuticals Production edit Raceway pond used for the cultivation of microalgae The water is kept in constant motion with a powered paddle wheel Two main ways of cultivating microalgae are raceway pond systems and photo-bioreactors Raceway pond systems are constructed by a closed loop oval channel that has a paddle wheel to circulate water and prevent sedimentation The channel is open to the air and its depth is in the range of m ft The pond needs to be kept shallow since self-shading and optical absorption can cause the limitation of light penetration through the solution of algae broth PBRs s culture medium is constructed by closed transparent array of tubes It has a central reservoir which circulated the microalgae broth PBRs is an easier system to be controlled compare to the raceway pond system yet it costs a larger overall production expenses citation needed The carbon emissions from microalgae biomass produced in raceway ponds could be compared to the emissions from conventional biodiesel by having inputs of energy and nutrients as carbon-intensive The corresponding emissions from microalgae biomass produced in PBRs could also be compared and might even exceed the emissions from conventional fossil diesel The inefficiency is due to the amount of electricity used to pump the algae broth around the system Using co-product to generate electricity is one strategy that might improve the overall carbon balance Another thing that needs to be acknowledged is that environmental impacts can also come from water management carbon dioxide handling and nutrient supply several aspects that could constrain system design and implementation options But in general Raceway Pond systems demonstrate a more attractive energy balance than PBR systems citation needed Economy edit Production cost of microalgae-biofuel through implementation of raceway pond systems is dominated by the operational cost which includes labour raw materials and utilities In raceway pond system during the cultivation process electricity takes up the largest energy fraction of total operational energy requirements It is used to circulate the microalgae cultures It takes up an energy fraction ranging from to In contrast capital cost dominates the cost of production of microalgae-biofuel in PBRs This system has a high installation cost though the operational cost is relatively lower than raceway pond systems citation needed Microalgae-biofuel production costs a larger amount of money compared to fossil fuel production The cost estimation of producing microalgae-biofuel is around per litre US gal which is considerably more expensive than conventional gasoline However when compared with electrification of the vehicle fleet a key advantage of such biofuel is the avoidance of the costly distribution of large amounts of electrical energy as is required to convert existing vehicle fleets to battery electric technology therein allowing for the re-use of the existing liquid-fuel transportation infrastructure Biofuel such as ethanol is also greatly more energy dense than current battery technologies approximately x as much further promoting its economic viability Environmental impact edit The construction of large-scale microalgae cultivation facilities would inevitably result in negative environmental impacts related to land use change such as the destruction of existing natural habitats Microalgae can also under certain conditions emit greenhouse gases like methane or nitrous oxide or foul-smelling gases like hydrogen sulfide although this has not been widely studied to date If poorly managed toxins naturally produced by microalgae may leak into the surrounding soil or ground water Production edit Water undergoes electrolysis at high temperatures to form hydrogen gas and oxygen gas The energy to perform this is extracted from renewable sources such as wind power Then the hydrogen is reacted with compressed carbon dioxide captured by direct air capture The reaction produces blue crude which consists of hydrocarbon The blue crude is then refined to produce high efficiency E-diesel This method is however still debatable because with the current production capability it can only produce liters in a few months of the daily production of fuel in the US Furthermore the thermodynamic and economic feasibility of this technology have been questioned An article suggests that this technology does not create an alternative to fossil fuel but rather converting renewable energy into liquid fuel The article also states that the energy return on energy invested using fossil diesel is times higher than that for e-diesel History edit Investigation of carbon-neutral fuels has been ongoing for decades A report suggested synthesizing methanol from carbon dioxide in air using nuclear power for a mobile fuel depot Shipboard production of synthetic fuel using nuclear power was studied in and A report studied the recovery of carbon dioxide from fossil fuel plants A report compared converting vehicle fleets for the use of carbon-neutral methanol with the further synthesis of gasoline See also edit Energy portal Renewable energy portal Ecology portal Artificial photosynthesis Butanol fuel Carbon-neutral hydrogen production Carbon cycle re-balancing

airborne wind-energy conversion systems AWECS also AWES or crosswind kite power systems CWKPS The kite system is characterized by energy -harvesting parts flying transversely to the direction of the ambient wind i e to crosswind mode sometimes the entire wing set and tether set are flown in crosswind mode From toy to power-grid-feeding sizes these systems may be used as high-altitude wind power HAWP devices or low-altitude wind power LAWP devices without having to use towers Flexible wings or rigid wings may be used in the kite system A tethered wing flying in crosswind at many times wind speed harvests wind power from an area that exceeds the wing s total area by many times Crosswind kite power systems have some advantages over conventional wind turbines including access to more powerful and stable wind resources a high capacity factor capability for deployment on and offshore at comparable costs and no need for a tower Additionally the wings of the CWKPS may vary in aerodynamic efficiency the movement of crosswinding tethered wings is sometimes compared with the outer parts of conventional wind turbine blades However a conventional traverse-to-wind rotating blade set carried aloft in a kite-power system has the blade set cutting to crosswind and is a form of crosswind kite power Miles L Loyd furthered studies on crosswind kite power systems in his work Crosswind Kite Power There are crosswind advocates who believe that crosswind kite power was introduced by P Payne and C McCutchen in their patent No filed in however crosswind kite power was used far before such a patent e g in target kites for war-target practice where the cross winding power permitted high speeds to give practice to gunners US figs This illustrates where parts of the wing set of a crosswind kite power device is cross winding during conversion of the wind s kinetic energy Crosswind kite power station with separate motion transfer with two wings offshore artist s impression Drawing from patent US Scheme of some types of airborne crosswind power systems BenjaminTignerFig US Farming crosswind kite power devices is illustrated by Benjamin Tigner Lifter of human by use of fast-motion autorotating bladed crosswind kite power system a gyro kite type As George Pocock controlled his kite system wings to left or right he would gain power because of the crosswind kite power energy-gain effect Kite-Wahnsinn am Silvaplana See The crosswind kite power systems shown has a purpose to move the athlete fast downwind upwind and sometimes into the air to significant altitudes and distances The wind is slightly slowed by such activity as the CWKPS harvests energy from the wind Kiteboarding Types of crosswind kite power systems CWKPS edit How a system extracts energy from the wind and transfers energy to useful purposes helps to define types of crosswind kite power systems One type of parameter regards the position of the generator or pump or tasking line or device Another type of parameter regards how the tethers of the tether set of the kite system are utilized the tethers holding the kiting wing elements aloft may be used in various ways to form types tethers may simply hold working wings aloft or they may be pulling loads on the ground or multitasking by sending aloft-gained electricity to ground receivers or by pulling loads or by being the tasking device itself as when used for pulling people or things or cutting or grinding things Some types are distinguished by fast motion transfer or slow motion transfer Typing of crosswind kite power system also occurs by the nature of the wing set where count of wings and types of wings matter to designers and users a wing set might be in a train arrangement stack configuration arch complex dome mesh coordinating family of wings or just be a simple single-wing with single tether Types of crosswind kite power devices are also distinguished by scale purpose intended life and cost level Typing by economic success occurs is the system effective in the energy or task market or not Some CWKPS are a type called lifters they are purposed just for lifting loads perhaps humans the type is frequented by the use of auto rotating blades that appear then to look like helicopters A single crosswind kite power system CWKPS may be a hybrid complex performing aloft energy generation while also performing ground-based work through tether pulling of loads The crosswind kite power systems that involve fluttering elements are being explored in several research centres flutter is mined for energy conversion in a few ways Researchers are showing types of CWKPS that are difficult to classify or type Tether pulling of people or goods on boards in hulls with skis etc edit In the systems of this type of CWKPS the pulling tether set drives the resisting people and objects to various points on the surface of water bodies or land or points in the atmosphere In this type of crosswind kite power operation the design of the resistive objects people boards hulls boats ships water turbines air turbines other wings makes for further types Cross winding of the upper flying wings provide power to achieve certain final objectives The objectives are found in such as kiteboarding kite windsurfing snow kiting yacht kiting freighter-ship sailing kite boating and free-flight soaring and jumping A collection of researchers have explored the historic free-flight parakite realm to where crosswind flying of the systems wings would enable free-flight in the atmosphere fundamentally this is a kite-string set with a wing above and a wing as the resistive anchor set control of the separate wing set especially in cross winding efforts mine the power of winds in different layers of the atmosphere Tether pulling to drive generator or pump shafts edit In the systems of this type an electrical generator pump or tasking line is installed on the ground There are two subtypes with or without a secondary vehicle In the subtype without a secondary vehicle the Yo-Yo method the tether slowly unwinds off a drum on the ground due to the windward pull of the kite system s wing while the wing travels crosswind that is left-right of the wind s ambient direction along various paths e g a figure- flight path optimized lemniscate paths or circular paths small or large radius The turning drum rotates the rotor of the generator or pump through perhaps a high-ratio gearbox Periodically the wing is powered and the tether is reeled in or using the crosswind for a constant pull the tether is re-connected to a different section of the drum while the wing is traveling in a downwind cycle In some systems two tethers are used instead of one In another subtype a secondary vehicle is used Such a vehicle can be a carousel a car railed cart wheeled land vehicle or even a ship on the water The electrical generator is installed on the vehicle The rotor of the electrical generator is brought in motion by the carousel the axle of the car or the screw of the ship correspondingly Onboard generator edit In the systems of this type one or more flying blades and electrical generators are installed on the wing The relative airflow rotates the blades by way of autorotation an interaction with the wind which transfer the power to the generators Produced electrical energy is transmitted to the ground through an electrical cable laid along the tether or integrated with the tether The same blades are sometimes used for double purpose where they are propellers positively driven by costed electricity for launching or special landing or calm-air flight-maintaining purpose Fast motion transfer with downwind ground receivers edit In this type an electrical generator is installed on the ground and a separate cable or belt trailing behind the wing transfers the power to a sprocket on the ground which rotates the rotor of the generator The separate belt extends at approximately the speed of the wing Because of the high speed of that belt the gearbox is not required Motion transfer with upwind ground receivers edit In this type an electrical generator pump tasking line set or lever is installed on the ground upwind of the wing and driven by the operation of two or three or more tethers arranged from a fast-moving cross winding flying wing set Examples are found in the research centres of several universities and kite-energy research centres Lighter-than-air LTA assisted twin-coordinating wing sets edit Several research centres are exploring twin wing sets employing tether pulling of upwind ground-based loads where the cross winding wing sets use lighter-than-air devices to assure flight in case of lulls in the ambient wind LTA-kite-balloon-lofted fast-moving autorotating bladed turbine with upwind receiver of electricity edit Many in-public-domain patent disclosed teachings and some current research centres are with a focus on using LTA kites to hold bladed turbines using autorotation to drive flown generators Flutter-based crosswind kite power systems fast-motion method edit When a wing element in a kite system is designed to have flutter occur that fluttering may be harvested for energy to power various loads In flutter the wing element travels to crosswind and then reverses to travel to crosswind in a generally opposite direction the frequency of cycles of reversed direction is high Flutter in traditional aviation is usually considered a bad and destructive dynamic to be designed out of an aircraft but in CWKPS flutter is sometimes designed into the kite system for the specific purpose of converting the wind s kinetic energy to useful purposes the fast motion of flutter is prized by some kite-energy systems development centres Harvesting the energy of flutter in kite systems has been done in several ways One way is to convert the flutter energy into sound even pleasant sound or music purposes vary from entertaining one person or a crowd of persons bird-scaring has been an application Jerking tether lines by the kite-flown fluttering elements to drive loads to make electricity has been done and is being explored Pumping fluids by use of flutter-derived energy has been proposed in the kite-energy community And having the fluttering wing made with appropriate materials and arrangement to be a direct electric-generator part then electricity can be generated immediately part of the fluttering wing that is formed to be a magnet flutters by conductive coils forms the parts of the electric generator Traction by use of CWKPS edit CWKPS are used to move objects immediately over ice snow land ponds lakes or oceans The movement of objects may be done for various reasons recreation sport commerce industry science travel mine-clearing defence offense plowing landscaping etc The multitude of kite systems flown to crosswind to move kite boarders land sailors kite surfers kite boaters yachts ships catamarans kayaks power kiters kite buggies kite skiers kite water skiers etc is keeping kite-wing manufacturers busy Sky Sails is a leader in saving fuel in the shipping industry by using CWKPS Lifters using CWKPS edit In this type of CWKPS the fast-motion of the flying blades or wings harvest the wind s energy to power the lifting capacity of the system Mass loads are sometimes close-coupled with the wing set at other times the mass lifted is distributed along the tether set A military use of this type involved rotor kites tethered by the kite line a human observer gets lifted to high points for observation purposes Some of these were used in conjunction with submarine operations with the submarine s towing motion providing the apparent wind for the CWKPS One example is the Focke-Achgelis Fa Lift-and-place or lift-and-drop uses occur in this type mass loads are lifted and then placed or dropped this is done sometimes to overcome barriers or to save ground-transportation fuel costs When the mass that is lifted is a generator coupled with the crosswinding blades then the AWES type is changed this change is the foundation for the focus of some current wind power companies Torque transfer via rotary tether sets CWKPS edit In this type a set of kites is grouped to form a rotor the rotary cross wind kites drive their set of tethers around a shared axis Rings are set inside the rotary tethers to assist in holding the tethers apart The tensile lines then transfer torque from the rotating kites to a ground based generator On December this method was the first to successfully complete the someawe org challenge For a prototype demonstration see Theory edit In all types of the crosswind kite power system the useful power can be approximately described by the Loyd s formula P a A C L C L C D V displaystyle P over rho a AC L C L over C D V where P is power C L and C D are coefficients of lift and drag respectively a is the air density at the altitude of the wing A is the wing area and V is the wind speed This formula disregards tether drag wing and tether weights change of the air density with altitude and angle of the wing motion vector to the plane perpendicular to the wind A more precise formula is P a A C L G V displaystyle P over rho a AC L G V where G is the effective gliding ratio taking into account the tether drag Example a system with a rigid wing having dimensions m x m and G in the m s wind will provide MW of electric power Control of crosswind-kite-power source edit Depending on the final application of a crosswind-kite-power source differing kite control methods are used Human control exercised during the full flight session is used in crosswind stunt kiting and kiteboarding the same has been in place for some electricity-producing crosswind-kite-power source e g by Pierre Benhaiem of France When the crosswind-kite-power source becomes too large to handle human-assisted devices or fully autonomous robotic control systems can be implemented Fully passive crosswind-kite-power sources have been demonstrated using the natural frequencies of a system to permit the absence of human or robot controls a kited wing tossing back and forth in constant motion is a primitive passively controlled crosswind-kite-power source Advances in computers sensors kite steering units and servo-mechanisms are being applied to attain full autonomy of the launching flying and landing of crosswind-kite-power source that are aiming for the utility-scale energy-production market Challenges edit Some sectors of crosswind kite power are already commercially robust the sport low altitude traction industry is one of those sectors toy sport crosswind kite power systems kept at low altitude must remain safe But the sectors of high altitude larger CWKPS aiming for utility-scale electrical production to compete against other forms of energy production must overcome various challenges to achieve mainstream acceptance Some of the challenges are regulatory permissions including use of airspace and land safety considerations reliable operation in varying conditions day night summer winter fog high wind low wind etc third-party assessment and certification lifecycle cost modelling History edit In the early s George Pocock used control of kite system wings to crosswind to good effect In the early s Paul Garber produced high speed wings by two-line controls to give targets for aircraft gunners Crosswind kite power was brought again into focus when Miles L Loyd carefully described the mathematics and potential of crosswind kite power in In it was not possible to create an economical automatic control system to control the wings of a kite system though passive control of crosswinding kite systems had been ancient With the advance of computational and sensory resources fine control of the wings of a kite system became not only affordable but cheap In the same time significant progress was made in the materials and wing construction techniques new types of flexible kites with good L D ratio have been invented Synthetic materials suitable for the wing and tether became affordable among those materials are UHMWPE carbon fibre PETE and rip-stop nylon A large number of people became engaged in the sports of kitesurfing kiteboarding kite buggying snowkiting and power kiting Multiple companies and academic teams work on crosswind kite power Most of the progress in the field has been achieved in the last years citation needed Prospects for crosswind kite power edit Enthusiasm seems to be at a high level among over a thousand workers in the crosswind kite power realm that includes scales from toy scale to utility-grid Speculation for traveling and moving goods without fuel around the world by use of CWKPS is envisioned both by systems staying connected to the ground and some systems fully disconnected from the ground Objectives for the future discussed in the literature regard CWKPS facing toy sport industry science commerce energy for electrical grid sailing and a host of other tasking applications For CWKPS to compete with solar energy nuclear energy fossil fuels conventional wind power DWKPS or other renewable energy sources the levelized cost of energy from CWKPS will need to become competitive proven made known and adopted during CWKPS march into the future other competing sectors will be advancing also The variety of configurations of kite systems that will fly wings to crosswind for the enhanced power is expected to grow however for specific purposes and applications some winning formats are expected to eventually shine Placing wing elements that fly to crosswind on huge lofted rope-based arches or even net domes is being researched Patents that involve crosswind kite power edit Various patents have been issued relating to crosswind kite power These include US Self-erecting windmill by Charles McCutchen and Peter R Payne They filed on January Their work is now in the public domain US Multi-tether cross-wind kite power by Benjamin Tigner filed on January but has a priority date of January He teaches crosswind

permitted aggressive mining of the wind with crosswind motions and water reachability Similar structure technology is being used in some AWES crosswind kite power research centres around the world Scale of crosswind kite power systems edit Crosswind kite power systems are found in toy power kites sport power kites and experimental-handy sizes proposed by research centres are huge utility-grid-power-feeding sizes The power gained in toy sizes is used to excite product users two-line and four-line crosswind toy kite-power systems fill kite festival skies Serious sport crosswind kite power systems drive the movement of athletes around race courses in local and national competitions Experimental-handy sizes of crosswind kite power systems are explored while furthering research toward utility-scale systems Timeline of uses and progress of crosswind kite power edit Crosswind kite power has been put to various uses throughout history And the variety of devices that produce crosswind kite power have a historical progression A simple kite system sitting passively without crosswind kite power production is contrasted with kite systems that fly crosswind producing greater harvesting of energy from the wind s kinetic energy For perspective a timeline of crosswind kite power uses and device progress may aid in understanding crosswind kite power In May Google acquired a California company developing systems with onboard generators flown to crosswind in circular paths using a hybrid aircraft that double-purposes flying blades as turbine blades as well as costed-energy propellers Their system is designed to operate as a powered aircraft when needed the blades and generator are then converted to operate as propellers and motor November Progress is exhibited by NTS Gmbh on X-wind crosswind kite power system using railed cars that pull line that drives ground generator NTS X-Wind at EcoSummit Duesseldorf A closed loop rail with cable-connected cars work in concert to pull the loop cable Each railed car is pulled by a four-tethered kited wing each wing is controlled by an autopilot or kite-steering unit circa Retail market sees an entry of a crosswind

used in military target practice by Paul E Garber The gained crosswind kite power was used to produce speed of the target wing to simulate enemy aircraft May June Miles L Loyd of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory Livermore California published in the Journal of Energy Vol No Article No - Crosswind Kite Power He focused on flying the wings of kite systems traverse to the ambient wind he noted that the crosswind airspeed of the wings would allow mining the involved kinetic energy for both keeping the wings flying as well as driving other loads for secondary purposes circa George Pocock demonstrated control of kite-power system to crosswind to obtain energy to draw vehicle rapidly Many will later consider him as a father of crosswind kite power that uses the harvested wind energy for traction purposes Distinguish CWKPS from non-CWKPS edit Kite-power systems dedicated to operating without its energy-harvesting elements flying to crosswind are not CWKPS Examples help to clarify the two branches of kite-power systems A simple symmetrical two-stick diamond kite let out to downwind flight while the system s tether pulls to turn an at-ground generator shaft is producing energy for use by flying downwind without flying to crosswind such is a non-CWKPS Some hefty downwind kite-power systems DWKPS are proposed by serious researchers some DWKPS instruction is found in the patent literature one trend involves the opening and closing of pilot-kite-lifted opening-and-closing parachutes to drive generators Notice that some CWKPS such as Jalbert parafoil working in figure- patterns to turn a ground-stationed generator could be commissioned to operate fully without flying to crosswind and the resultant kite-power system would then be a DWKPS Differently the CWKPS proposed by users of the autorotating blades stay necessarily as CWKPS Magenn Power s flip-wing kite-balloon is a DWKPS Similar flip-wing rotating wings are DWKPS e g that taught in Edwards and Evan patent Benjamin Franklin s legendary pond-crossing by kite power was a simple DWKPS he was merely dragged downwind by a downwind-flying kite A non-CWPKS is historically illustrated by a kite-power

Sustainable biofuel Tidal power Tidal stream generator Wave power Wind power Nuclear power proposed as renewable energy Topics by country and territory Marketing and policy trends v t e Geothermal energy is thermal energy extracted from the Earth s crust It combines energy from the formation of the planet and from radioactive decay Geothermal energy has been exploited as a source of heat and or electric power for millennia Geothermal heating using water from hot springs for example has been used for bathing since Paleolithic times and for space heating since Roman times Geothermal power generation of electricity from geothermal energy has been used since the th century Geothermal power plants produce power at a constant rate without regard to weather conditions Geothermal resources are theoretically more than adequate to supply humanity s energy needs Most extraction occurs in areas near tectonic plate boundaries The cost of generating geothermal power decreased by during the s and s Technological advances continued to reduce costs and thereby expand the amount of viable resources In the US Department of Energy estimated that power from a newly built plant costs about kWh In megawatts MW of geothermal power was available worldwide An additional gigawatts provided heat for district heating space heating spas industrial processes desalination and agricultural applications as of As of the industry employed about one hundred thousand people The adjective geothermal originates from the Greek roots g meaning the Earth and therm s meaning hot History edit The oldest known pool fed by a hot spring built in the Qin dynasty in the rd century BC Hot springs have been used for bathing since at least Paleolithic times The oldest known spa is at the site of the Huaqing Chi palace In the first century CE Romans conquered Aquae Sulis now Bath Somerset England and used the hot springs there to supply public baths and underfloor heating The admission fees for these baths probably represent the first commercial use of geothermal energy The world s oldest geothermal district heating system in Chaudes-Aigues France has been operating since the th century The earliest industrial exploitation began in with the use of geyser steam to extract boric acid from volcanic mud in Larderello Italy In the US s first district heating system in Boise Idaho was powered by geothermal energy It was copied in Klamath Falls Oregon in The world s first known building to utilize geothermal energy as its primary heat source was the Hot Lake Hotel in Union County Oregon beginning in A geothermal well was used to heat greenhouses in Boise in and geysers were used to heat greenhouses in Iceland and Tuscany at about the same time Charles Lieb developed the first downhole heat exchanger in to heat his house Geyser steam and water began heating homes in Iceland in Global geothermal electric capacity Upper red line is installed capacity lower green line is realized production In the th century geothermal energy came into use as a generating source Prince Piero Ginori Conti tested the first geothermal power generator on July at the Larderello steam field It successfully lit four light bulbs In the world s first commercial geothermal power plant was built there It was the only industrial producer of geothermal power until New Zealand built a plant in In it produced some megawatts In Pacific Gas and Electric began operation of the first US geothermal power plant at The Geysers in California The original turbine lasted for more than years and produced MW net power An organic fluid based binary cycle power station was first demonstrated in in the USSR and later introduced to the US in citation needed This technology allows the use of temperature resources as low as C In a binary cycle plant in Chena Hot Springs Alaska came on-line producing electricity from a record low temperature of C F Resources edit Enhanced geothermal system Reservoir Pump house Heat exchanger Turbine hall Production well Injection well Hot water to district heating Porous sediments Observation well Crystalline bedrock The Earth has an internal heat content of joules TWh About of this is residual heat from planetary accretion the remainder is attributed to past and current radioactive decay of naturally occurring isotopes For example a m deep borehole in United Downs Deep Geothermal Power Project in Cornwall England found granite with very high thorium content whose radioactive decay is believed to power the high temperature of the rock Earth s interior temperature and pressure are high enough to cause some rock to melt and the solid mantle to behave plastically Parts of the mantle convect upward since it is lighter than the surrounding rock Temperatures at the core mantle boundary can reach over C F The Earth s internal thermal energy flows to the surface by conduction at a rate of terawatts TW and is replenished by radioactive decay of minerals at a rate of TW These power rates are more than double humanity s current energy consumption from all primary sources but most of this energy flux is not recoverable In addition to the internal heat flows the top layer of the surface to a depth of m ft is heated by solar energy during the summer and cools during the winter Outside of the seasonal variations the geothermal gradient of temperatures through the crust is C F per km of depth in most of the world The conductive heat flux averages MW km These values are much higher near tectonic plate boundaries where the crust is thinner They may be further augmented by combinations of fluid circulation either through magma conduits hot springs hydrothermal circulation The thermal efficiency and profitability of electricity generation is particularly sensitive to temperature Applications receive the greatest benefit from a high natural heat flux most easily from a hot spring The next best option is to drill a well into a hot aquifer An artificial hot water reservoir may be built by injecting water to hydraulically fracture bedrock The systems in this last approach are called enhanced geothermal systems estimates of the potential for electricity generation from geothermal energy vary widely from to TW depending on the scale of investments Upper estimates of geothermal resources assume wells as deep as kilometres mi although th century wells rarely reached more than kilometres mi deep Wells of this depth are common in the petroleum industry Geothermal power edit Main article Geothermal power Geothermal power is electrical power generated from geothermal energy Dry steam flash steam and binary cycle power stations have been used for this purpose As of geothermal electricity was generated in countries As of worldwide geothermal power capacity amounted to gigawatts GW of which percent or GW were in the United States Geothermal energy supplies a significant share of the electrical power in Iceland El Salvador Kenya the Philippines and New Zealand Geothermal power is considered to be a renewable energy because heat extraction rates are insignificant compared to the Earth s heat content The greenhouse gas emissions of geothermal electric stations are on average grams of carbon dioxide per kilowatt-hour of electricity or less than percent of that of coal-fired plants Geothermal electric plants were traditionally built on the edges of tectonic plates where high-temperature geothermal resources approach the surface These plants are usually built on land where the subsurface has high temperatures is highly permeable and is near a large water reserve as a source for a working fluid The development of binary cycle power plants and improvements in drilling and extraction technology enable enhanced geothermal systems over a greater geographical range Demonstration projects are operational in Landau-Pfalz Germany and Soultz-sous-For ts France while an earlier effort in Basel Switzerland was shut down after it triggered earthquakes Other demonstration projects are under construction in Australia the United Kingdom and the US In Myanmar over locations are capable of geothermal power production some of which are near Yangon Direct use data Country Capacity MW United States Philippines Indonesia Mexico Italy New Zealand Iceland Japan Iran

Iceland Indonesia Italy Japan Kenya Mexico New Zealand Nicaragua Papua New Guinea Philippines Portugal Romania Russia Thailand Turkey United States Total Geothermal heating edit Main article Geothermal heating Geothermal heating is the use of geothermal energy to heat buildings and water for human use Humans have done this since the Paleolithic era Approximately seventy countries made direct use of a total of PJ of geothermal heating in As of GW of geothermal heating satisfied of global primary energy consumption Thermal efficiency is high since no energy conversion is needed but capacity factors tend to be low around since the heat is mostly needed in the winter Even cold ground contains heat below metres ft the undisturbed ground temperature is consistently at the Mean Annual Air Temperature that may be extracted with a ground source heat pump Types edit Hydrothermal systems edit Hydrothermal systems produce geothermal energy by accessing naturally occurring hydrothermal reservoirs Hydrothermal systems come in either vapor-dominated or liquid-dominated forms Vapor-dominated plants edit Larderello and The Geysers are vapor-dominated Vapor-dominated sites offer temperatures from to C that produce superheated steam Liquid-dominated plants edit Liquid-dominated reservoirs LDRs are more common with temperatures greater than C F and are found near volcanoes in around the Pacific Ocean and in rift zones and hot spots Flash plants are the common way to generate electricity from these sources Steam from the well is sufficient to power the plant Most wells generate MW of electricity Steam is separated from liquid via cyclone separators and drives electric generators Condensed liquid returns down the well for reheating reuse As of the largest liquid system was Cerro Prieto in Mexico which generates MW of electricity from temperatures reaching C F Lower-temperature LDRs C require pumping They are common in extensional terrains where heating takes place via deep circulation along faults such as in the Western US and Turkey Water passes through a heat exchanger in a Rankine cycle binary plant The water vaporizes an organic working fluid that drives a turbine These binary plants originated in the Soviet Union in the late s and predominate in new plants Binary plants have no emissions Engineered geothermal systems edit An engineered geothermal system is a geothermal system that engineers have artificially created or improved Engineered geothermal systems are used in a variety of geothermal reservoirs that have hot rocks but insufficient natural reservoir quality for example insufficient geofluid quantity or insufficient rock permeability or porosity to operate as natural hydrothermal systems Types of engineered geothermal systems include enhanced geothermal systems closed-loop or advanced geothermal systems and some superhot rock geothermal systems Enhanced geothermal systems edit Main article Enhanced geothermal system Enhanced geothermal systems EGS actively inject water into wells to be heated and pumped back out The water is injected under high pressure to expand existing rock fissures to enable the water to flow freely The technique was adapted from oil and gas fracking techniques The geologic formations are deeper and no toxic chemicals are used reducing the possibility of environmental damage Instead proppants such as sand or ceramic particles are used to keep the cracks open and producing optimal flow rates Drillers can employ directional drilling to expand the reservoir size Small-scale EGS have been installed in the Rhine Graben at Soultz-sous-For ts in France and at Landau and Insheim in Germany Closed-loop geothermal systems edit Main article Closed-loop geothermal Closed-loop geothermal systems sometimes colloquially referred to as Advanced Geothermal Systems AGS are engineered geothermal systems containing subsurface working fluid that is heated in the hot rock reservoir without direct contact with rock pores and fractures Instead the subsurface working fluid stays inside a closed loop of deeply buried pipes that conduct Earth s heat The advantages of a deep closed-loop geothermal circuit include no need for a geofluid no need for the hot rock to be permeable or porous and all the introduced working fluid can be recirculated with zero loss Eavor tm a Canadian-based geothermal startup piloted their closed-loop system in shallow soft rock formations in Alberta Canada Situated within a sedimentary basin the geothermal gradient proved to be insufficient for electrical power generation However the system successfully produced approximately MWh of thermal energy during its initial two years of operation Economics edit This section needs to be updated Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information November As with wind and solar energy geothermal power has minimal operating costs capital costs dominate Drilling accounts for over half the costs and not all wells produce exploitable resources For example as of a typical well pair one for extraction and one for injection in Nevada can produce megawatts MW and costs about million to drill with a failure rate making the average cost of a successful well million A power plant at The Geysers Drilling geothermal wells is more expensive than drilling oil and gas wells of comparable depth for several reasons Geothermal reservoirs are usually in igneous or metamorphic rock which is harder to penetrate than the sedimentary rock of typical hydrocarbon reservoirs The rock is often fractured which causes vibrations that damage bits and other drilling tools The rock is often abrasive with high quartz content and sometimes contains highly corrosive fluids The rock is hot which limits use of downhole electronics Well casing must be cemented from top to bottom to resist the casing s tendency to expand and contract with temperature changes Oil and gas wells are usually cemented only at the bottom Well diameters are considerably larger than typical oil and gas wells As of plant construction and well drilling cost about million per MW of electrical capacity while the break-even price was per kW h Enhanced geothermal systems tend to be on the high side of these ranges with capital costs above million per MW and break-even above per kW h Between and private investments were the main source of funding for renewable energy comprising approximately of total financing The mix between private and public funding varies among different renewable energy technologies influenced by their market appeal and readiness In geothermal energy received just of its investment from private sources Socioeconomic benefits edit In January the Energy Sector Management Assistance Program ESMAP report Socioeconomic Impacts of Geothermal Energy Development was published highlighting the substantial socioeconomic benefits of geothermal energy development which notably exceeds those of wind and solar by generating an estimated jobs per megawatt across various sectors The report details how geothermal projects contribute to skill development through practical on-the-job training and formal education thereby strengthening the local workforce and expanding employment opportunities It also underscores the collaborative nature of geothermal development with local communities which leads to improved infrastructure skill-building programs and revenue-sharing models thereby enhancing access to reliable electricity and heat These improvements have the potential to boost agricultural productivity and food security The report further addresses the commitment to advancing gender equality and social inclusion by offering job opportunities education and training to underrepresented groups ensuring fair access to the benefits of geothermal development Collectively these efforts are instrumental in driving domestic economic growth increasing fiscal revenues and contributing to more stable and diverse national economies while also offering significant social benefits such as better health education and community cohesion Development edit Geothermal projects have several stages of development Each phase has associated risks Many projects are canceled during the stages of reconnaissance and geophysical surveys which are unsuitable for traditional lending At later stages can often be equity-financed Precipitate scaling edit A common issue encountered in geothermal systems arises when the system is situated in carbonate-rich formations In such cases the fluids extracting heat from the subsurface often dissolve fragments of the rock during their ascent towards the surface where they subsequently cool As the fluids cool dissolved cations precipitate out of solution leading to the formation of calcium scale a phenomenon known as calcite scaling This calcite scaling has the potential to decrease flow rates and necessitate system downtime for maintenance purposes Sustainability edit Geothermal energy is considered to be sustainable because the heat extracted is so small compared to the Earth s heat content which is approximately billion times worldwide annual energy consumption Earth s heat flows are not in equilibrium the planet is cooling on geologic timescales Anthropic heat extraction typically does not accelerate the cooling process Wells can further be considered renewable because they return the extracted water to the borehole for reheating and re-extraction albeit at a lower temperature Replacing material use with energy has reduced the human environmental footprint in many applications Geothermal has the potential to allow further reductions For example Iceland has sufficient geothermal energy to eliminate fossil fuels for electricity production and to heat Reykjavik sidewalks and eliminate the need for gritting Electricity generation at Poihipi New Zealand Electricity generation at Ohaaki New Zealand Electricity generation at Wairakei New Zealand However local effects of heat extraction must be considered Over the course of decades individual wells draw down local temperatures and water levels The three oldest sites at Larderello Wairakei and the Geysers experienced reduced output because of local depletion Heat and water in uncertain proportions were extracted faster than they were replenished Reducing production and injecting additional water could allow these wells to recover their original capacity Such strategies have been implemented at some sites These sites continue to provide significant energy The Wairakei power station was commissioned in November and it attained its peak generation of MW in but already the supply of high-pressure steam was faltering In it was down-rated to intermediate pressure and the output to MW In two MW isopentane systems were added boosting output by about MW Detailed data were lost due to re-organisations Environmental effects edit Geothermal power station in the Philippines Krafla Geothermal Station in northeast Iceland Fluids drawn from underground carry a mixture of gasses notably carbon dioxide CO hydrogen sulfide H S methane CH and ammonia NH These pollutants contribute to global warming acid rain and noxious smells if released Existing geothermal electric plants emit an average of kilograms lb of CO per megawatt-hour MW h of electricity a small fraction of the emission intensity of fossil fuel plants needs update A few plants emit more pollutants than gas-fired power at least in the first few years such as some geothermal power in Turkey Plants that experience high levels of acids and volatile chemicals are typically equipped with emission-control systems to reduce the exhaust New emerging closed looped technologies developed by Eavor have the potential to reduce these emissions to zero Water from geothermal sources may hold in solution trace amounts of toxic elements such as mercury arsenic boron and antimony These chemicals precipitate as the water cools and can damage surroundings if released The modern practice of returning geothermal fluids into the Earth to stimulate production has the side benefit of reducing this environmental impact Construction can adversely affect land stability Subsidence occurred in the Wairakei field In Staufen im Breisgau Germany tectonic uplift occurred instead A previously isolated anhydrite layer came in contact with water and turned it into gypsum doubling its volume Enhanced geothermal systems can trigger earthquakes as part of hydraulic fracturing A project in Basel Switzerland was suspended because more than seismic events measuring up to on the Richter Scale occurred over the first days of water injection Geothermal power production has minimal land and freshwater requirements Geothermal plants use square kilometres sq mi per gigawatt of electrical production not capacity versus square kilometres sq mi and square kilometres sq mi for coal facilities and wind farms respectively They use litres US gal of freshwater per MW h versus over litres US gal per MW h for nuclear coal or oil

Renewable energy portal v t e Geothermal heating is the direct use of geothermal energy for some heating applications Humans have taken advantage of geothermal heat this way since the Paleolithic era Approximately seventy countries made direct use of a total of PJ of geothermal heating in As of GW of geothermal heating capacity is installed around the world satisfying of global primary energy consumption Thermal efficiency is high since no energy conversion is needed but capacity factors tend to be low around since the heat is mostly needed in the winter Geothermal energy originates from the heat retained within the Earth since the original formation of the planet from radioactive decay of minerals and from solar energy absorbed at the surface Most high temperature geothermal heat is harvested in regions close to tectonic plate boundaries where volcanic activity rises close to the surface of the Earth In these areas ground and groundwater can be found with temperatures higher than the target temperature of the application However even cold ground contains heat Below metres ft the undisturbed ground temperature is consistently at the mean annual air temperature and this heat can be extracted with a ground source heat pump Applications edit Top countries using the most geothermal heating in Country Production PJ yr Capacity GW Capacity factor Dominant applications China bathing Sweden heat pumps USA heat pumps Turkey district heating Iceland district heating Japan bathing onsens Hungary spas greenhouses Italy spas space heating New Zealand industrial uses others Total space heating Direct use of geothermal heat by category in as adapted from John W Lund Category GWh year Geothermal heat pumps Bathing and swimming Space heating Greenhouse heating Aquaculture pond heating Industrial uses Cooling snow melting Agriculture drying Others Total There are a wide variety of applications for cheap geothermal heat including heating of houses greenhouses bathing and swimming or industrial uses Most applications use geothermal in the form of hot fluids between C F and C F The suitable temperature varies for the different applications For direct use of geothermal heat the temperature range for the agricultural sector lies between C F and C F for space heating lies between C F to C F Heat pipes extend the temperature range down to C F as they extract and amplify the heat Geothermal heat exceeding C F is typically used for geothermal power generation In more than half of direct geothermal heat was used for space heating and a third was used for spas The remainder was used for a variety of industrial processes desalination domestic hot water and agricultural applications The cities of Reykjav k and Akureyri pipe hot water from geothermal plants under roads and pavements to melt snow Geothermal desalination has been demonstrated Geothermal systems tend to benefit from economies of scale so space heating power is often distributed to multiple buildings sometimes whole communities This technique long practiced throughout the world in locations such as Reykjav k Iceland Boise Idaho and Klamath Falls Oregon is known as district heating In Europe alone geothermal district heating plants were in operation in according to the European Geothermal Energy Council EGEC with a total capacity of approximately GWth Extraction edit Main article Ground-coupled heat exchanger Some parts of the world including substantial portions of the western USA are underlain by relatively shallow geothermal resources Similar conditions exist in Iceland parts of Japan and other geothermal hot spots around the world In these areas water or steam may be captured from natural hot springs and piped directly into radiators or heat exchangers Alternatively the heat may come from waste heat supplied by co-generation from a geothermal electrical plant or from deep wells into hot aquifers Direct geothermal heating is far more efficient than geothermal electricity generation and has less demanding temperature requirements so it is viable over a large geographical range If the shallow ground is hot but dry air or water may be circulated through earth tubes or downhole heat exchangers which act as heat exchangers with the ground Steam under pressure from deep geothermal resources is also used to generate electricity from geothermal power The Iceland Deep Drilling Project struck a pocket of magma at m A cemented steelcase was constructed in the hole with a perforation at the bottom close to the magma The high temperatures and pressure of the magma steam were used to generate MW of electricity making IDDP- the world s first magma-enhanced geothermal system In areas where the shallow ground is too cold to provide comfort directly it is still warmer than the winter air The thermal inertia of the shallow ground retains solar energy accumulated in the summertime and seasonal variations in ground temperature disappear completely below m of depth That heat can be extracted with a geothermal heat pump more efficiently than it can be generated by conventional furnaces Geothermal heat pumps are economically viable essentially anywhere in the world In theory geothermal energy usually cooling can also be extracted from existing infrastructure such as municipal water pipes Ground-source heat pumps edit Main article Geothermal heat pump In regions without any high temperature geothermal resources a ground-source heat pump GSHP can provide space heating and space cooling Like a refrigerator or air conditioner these systems use a heat pump to force the transfer of heat from the ground to the building Heat can be extracted from any source no matter how cold but a warmer source allows higher efficiency A ground-source heat pump uses the shallow ground or ground water typically starting at C or F as a source of heat thus taking advantage of its seasonally moderate temperatures In contrast an air source heat pump draws heat from the air colder outside air and thus requires more energy GSHPs circulate a carrier fluid usually a mixture of water and small amounts of antifreeze through closed pipe loops buried in the ground Single-home systems can be vertical loop field systems with bore holes feet m deep or if adequate land is available for extensive trenches a horizontal loop field is installed approximately six feet subsurface As the fluid circulates underground it absorbs heat from the ground and on its return the warmed fluid passes through the heat pump which uses electricity to extract heat from the fluid The re-chilled fluid is sent back into the ground thus continuing the cycle The heat extracted and that generated by the heat pump appliance as a byproduct is used to heat the house The addition of the ground heating loop in the energy equation means that significantly more heat can be transferred to a building than if electricity alone had been used directly for heating Switching the direction of heat flow the same system can be used to circulate the cooled water through the house for cooling in the summer months The heat is exhausted to the relatively cooler ground or groundwater rather than delivering it to the hot outside air as an air conditioner does As a result the heat is pumped across a larger temperature difference and this leads to higher efficiency and lower energy use This technology makes ground source heating economically viable in any geographical location In an estimated million ground-source heat pumps with a total capacity of GW extracted PJ of heat energy for space heating Global ground-source heat pump capacity is growing by annually History edit The oldest known pool fed by a hot spring built in the Qin dynasty in the rd century BC Hot springs have been used for bathing at least since Paleolithic times The oldest known spa is a stone pool on China s Mount Li built in the Qin dynasty in the rd century BC at the same site where the Huaqing Chi palace was later built Geothermal energy supplied channeled district heating for baths and houses in Pompeii around AD In the first century AD Romans conquered Aquae Sulis in England and used the hot springs there to feed public baths and underfloor heating The admission fees for these baths probably represents the first commercial use of geothermal power A -year-old hot tub has been located in Iceland where it was built by one of the island s original settlers The world s oldest working geothermal district heating system in Chaudes-Aigues France has been operating since the th century The earliest industrial exploitation began in with the use of geyser steam to extract boric acid from volcanic mud in Larderello Italy In America s first district heating system in Boise Idaho was powered directly by geothermal energy and was soon copied in Klamath Falls Oregon in A deep geothermal well was used to heat greenhouses in Boise in and geysers were used to heat greenhouses in Iceland and Tuscany at about the same time Charlie Lieb developed the first downhole heat exchanger in to heat his house Steam and hot water from the geysers began to be used to heat homes in Iceland in By this time Lord Kelvin had already invented the heat pump in and Heinrich Zoelly had patented the idea of using it to draw heat from the ground in But it was not until the late s that the geothermal heat pump was successfully implemented The earliest one was probably Robert C Webber s home-made kW direct-exchange system but sources disagree as to the exact timeline of his invention J Donald Kroeker designed the first commercial geothermal heat pump to heat the Commonwealth Building Portland Oregon and demonstrated it in Professor Carl Nielsen of Ohio State University built the first residential open loop version in his home in The technology became popular in Sweden as a result of the oil crisis and has been growing slowly in worldwide acceptance since then The development of polybutylene pipe greatly augmented the heat pump s economic viability Since a compelling body of research has been dedicated to numerically evidence the advantages and efficiency of using CO alternative to water as heat transmission fluid for geothermal energy recovery from enhanced geothermal systems EGS where the permeability of the underground source is enhanced by hydrofracturing As of there are over one million geothermal heat pumps installed worldwide providing GW of thermal capacity Each year about units are installed in the US and in Sweden Economics edit Geothermal drill machine Geothermal energy is a type of renewable energy that encourages conservation of natural resources According to the US Environmental Protection Agency geo-exchange systems save homeowners percent in heating costs and percent in cooling costs compared to conventional systems Geo-exchange systems also save money because they require much less maintenance In addition to being highly reliable they are built to last for decades Some utilities such as Kansas City Power and Light offer special lower winter rates for geothermal customers offering even more savings Geothermal drilling risks edit Cracks at the historic Town Hall of Staufen im Breisgau presumed due to damage from geothermal drilling In geothermal heating projects the underground is penetrated by trenches or drillholes As with all underground work projects may cause problems if the geology of the area is poorly understood In the spring of an exploratory geothermal drilling operation was conducted to provide geothermal heat to the town hall of Staufen im Breisgau After initially sinking a few millimeters a process called subsidence the city center has started to rise gradually causing considerable damage to buildings in the city center affecting numerous historic houses including the town hall It is hypothesized that the drilling perforated an anhydrite layer bringing high-pressure groundwater to come into contact with the anhydrite which then began to expand Currently no end to the rising process is in sight Data from the TerraSAR-X radar satellite before and after the changes confirmed the localised nature of the situation A geochemical process called anhydrite swelling has been confirmed as the cause of these uplifts This is a transformation of the mineral anhydrite anhydrous calcium sulphate into gypsum hydrous calcium sulphate A pre-condition for this transformation is that the anhydrite is in contact with water which is then stored in its crystalline structure There are other sources of potential risks i e cave enlargement or worsening of stability conditions quality or quantity degradation of groundwater resources Specific hazard worsening in the case of landslide-prone areas worsening of rocky mechanical characteristics soil and water pollution i e due to antifreeze additives or polluting constructive and boring material The design defined on the base of site-specific geological hydrogeological and

Countries generating more than percent of their electricity from geothermal sources include El Salvador Kenya the Philippines Iceland New Zealand and Costa Rica Indonesia has an estimated potential of GW of geothermal energy resources the largest in the world in its installed capacity was GW Geothermal power is considered to be a sustainable renewable source of energy because the heat extraction is small compared with the Earth s heat content The greenhouse gas emissions of geothermal electric stations average grams of carbon dioxide per kilowatt-hour of electricity or less than of those of conventional coal-fired plants As a source of renewable energy for both power and heating geothermal has the potential to meet to of global demand by With economic incentives it is estimated that by

fluid production has been in excess of km Subsidence at Wairakei-Tauhara has been an issue in a number of formal hearings related to environmental consents for expanded development of the system as a source of renewable energy In Pacific Gas and Electric began operation of the first successful geothermal electric power station in the United States at The Geysers in California The original turbine lasted for more than years and produced MW net power An organic fluid based binary cycle power station was first demonstrated in in the Soviet Union and later introduced to the United States in citation needed following the s energy crisis and significant changes in regulatory policies This technology allows the use of temperature resources as low as C F In a binary cycle station in Chena Hot Springs Alaska came on-line producing electricity from a record low fluid temperature of C F Geothermal electric stations have until recently been built exclusively where high-temperature geothermal resources are available near the surface The development of binary cycle power plants and improvements in drilling and extraction technology may enable enhanced geothermal systems over a much greater geographical range Demonstration projects are operational in Landau-Pfalz Germany and Soultz-sous-For ts France while an earlier effort in Basel Switzerland was shut down after it triggered earthquakes Other demonstration projects are under construction in Australia the United Kingdom and the United States of America The thermal efficiency of geothermal electric stations is low around to because geothermal fluids are at a low temperature compared with steam from boilers By the laws of thermodynamics this low temperature limits the efficiency of heat engines in extracting useful energy during the generation of electricity Exhaust heat is wasted unless it can be used directly and locally for example in greenhouses timber mills and district heating The efficiency of the system does not affect operational costs as it would for a coal or other fossil fuel plant but it does factor into the viability of the station In order to produce more energy than the pumps consume electricity generation requires high-temperature geothermal fields and specialized heat cycles citation needed Because geothermal power does not rely on variable sources of energy unlike for example wind or solar its capacity factor can be quite large up to has been demonstrated However the global average capacity factor was in according to the IPCC Resources edit Enhanced geothermal system Reservoir Pump house Heat exchanger Turbine hall Production well Injection well Hot water to district heating Porous sediments Observation well Crystalline bedrock The Earth s heat content is about TJ TWh This heat naturally flows to the surface by conduction at a rate of TW and is replenished by radioactive decay at a rate of TW These power rates are more than double humanity s current energy consumption from primary sources but most of this power is too diffuse approximately W m on average to be recoverable The Earth s crust effectively acts as a thick insulating blanket which must be pierced by fluid conduits of magma water or other to release the heat underneath Electricity generation requires high-temperature resources that can only come from deep underground The heat must be carried to the surface by fluid circulation either through magma conduits hot springs hydrothermal circulation oil wells drilled water wells or a combination of these This circulation sometimes exists naturally where the crust is thin magma conduits bring heat close to the surface and hot springs bring the heat to the surface If a hot spring is not available a well must be drilled into a hot aquifer Away from tectonic plate boundaries the geothermal gradient is to C per kilometre to F per mile of depth in most of the world so wells would have to be several kilometres deep to permit electricity generation The quantity and quality of recoverable resources improves with drilling depth and proximity to tectonic plate boundaries In ground that is hot but dry or where water pressure is inadequate injected fluid can stimulate production Developers bore two holes into a candidate site and fracture the rock between them with explosives or high-pressure water Then they pump water or liquefied carbon dioxide down one borehole and it comes up the other borehole as a gas This approach is called hot dry rock geothermal energy in Europe or enhanced geothermal systems in North America Much greater potential may be available from this approach than from conventional tapping of natural aquifers Estimates of the electricity generating potential of geothermal energy vary from to GW depending on the scale of investments This does not include non-electric heat recovered by co-generation geothermal heat pumps and other direct use A report by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology MIT that included the potential of enhanced geothermal systems estimated that investing US billion in research and development over years would allow the creation of GW of electrical generating capacity by in the United States alone The MIT report estimated that over TJ ZJ TWh would be extractable with the potential to increase this to over ZJ with technology improvements sufficient to provide all the world s present energy needs for several millennia At present geothermal wells are rarely more than km mi deep Upper estimates of geothermal resources assume wells as deep as km mi Drilling near this depth is now possible in the petroleum industry although it is an expensive process The deepest research well in the world the Kola Superdeep Borehole KSDB- is km mi deep Wells drilled to depths greater than km mi generally incur drilling costs in the tens of millions of dollars The technological challenges are to drill wide bores at low cost and to break larger volumes of rock Geothermal power is considered to be sustainable because the heat extraction is small compared to the Earth s heat content but extraction must still be monitored to avoid local depletion Although geothermal sites are capable of providing heat for many decades individual wells may cool down or run out of water The three oldest sites at Larderello Wairakei and the Geysers have all reduced production from their peaks It is not clear whether these stations extracted energy faster than it was replenished from greater depths or whether the aquifers supplying them are being depleted If production is reduced and water is reinjected these wells could theoretically recover their full potential Such mitigation strategies have already been implemented at some sites The long-term sustainability of geothermal energy has been demonstrated at the Larderello field in Italy since at the Wairakei field in New Zealand since and at the Geysers field in California since Power station types edit Dry steam left flash steam centre and binary cycle right power stations Geothermal power stations are similar to other steam turbine thermal power stations in that heat from a fuel source in geothermal s case the Earth s core is used to heat water or another working fluid The working fluid is then used to turn a turbine of a generator thereby producing electricity The fluid is then cooled and returned to the heat source Dry steam power stations edit Dry steam stations are the simplest and oldest design There are few power stations of this type because they require a resource that produces dry steam but they are the most efficient with the simplest facilities At these sites there may be liquid water present in the reservoir but only steam not water is produced to the surface Dry steam power directly uses geothermal steam of C F or greater to turn turbines As the turbine rotates it powers a generator that produces electricity and adds to the power field Then the steam is emitted to a condenser where it turns back into a liquid which then cools the water After the water is cooled it flows down a pipe that conducts the condensate back into deep wells where it can be reheated and produced again At The Geysers in California after the first years of power production the steam supply had depleted and generation was substantially reduced To restore some of the former capacity supplemental water injection was developed during the s and s including utilization of effluent from nearby municipal sewage treatment facilities Flash steam power stations edit Flash steam stations pull deep high-pressure hot water into lower-pressure tanks and use the resulting flashed steam to drive turbines They require fluid temperatures of at least C F usually more As of flash steam stations account for of all geothermal power plants and of the installed capacity in the world Flash steam plants use geothermal reservoirs of water with temperatures greater than C The hot water flows up through wells in the ground under its own pressure As it flows upward the pressure decreases and some of the hot water is transformed into steam The steam is then separated from the water and used to power a turbine generator Any leftover water and condensed steam may be injected back into the reservoir making this a potentially sustainable resource Binary cycle power stations edit Main article Binary cycle Binary cycle power stations are the most recent development and can accept fluid temperatures as low as C F The moderately hot geothermal water is passed by a secondary fluid with a much lower boiling point than water This causes the secondary fluid to flash vaporize which then drives the turbines This is the most common type of geothermal electricity station being constructed today Both Organic Rankine and Kalina cycles are used The thermal efficiency of this type of station is typically about Binary cycle power plants have an average unit capacity of MW MW at single-flash power plants MW at double-flash plants and MW at power plants working on superheated steam Worldwide production edit Cracks at the historic Town Hall of Staufen im Breisgau presumed due to damage from geothermal drilling A geothermal power station in Negros Oriental Philippines Geothermal power center in the Usulut n Department El Salvador The International Renewable Energy Agency has reported that MW of geothermal power was online worldwide at the end of generating GWh of electricity In theory the world s geothermal resources are sufficient to supply humans with energy However only a tiny fraction of the world s geothermal resources can at present be explored on a profitable basis Al Gore said in The Climate Project Asia Pacific Summit that Indonesia could become a super power country in electricity production from geothermal energy In the publicly owned electricity sector in India announced a plan to develop the country s first geothermal power facility in the landlocked state of Chhattisgarh Geothermal power in Canada has high potential due to its position on the Pacific Ring of Fire The region of greatest potential is the Canadian Cordillera stretching from British Columbia to the Yukon where estimates of generating output have ranged from MW to MW The geography of Japan is advantageous for geothermal power production Japan has numerous hot springs that could provide fuel for geothermal power plants but a massive investment in Japan s infrastructure would be necessary Utility-grade stations edit See also List of geothermal power stations Yearly

the IPCC produce on average kg of CO equivalent emissions per megawatt-hour of generated electricity kg CO eq MWh For comparison a coal-fired power plant emits kg of CO equivalent per megawatt-hour when not coupled with carbon capture and storage CCS As many geothermal projects are situated in volcanically active areas that naturally emit greenhouse gases it is hypothesized that geothermal plants may actually decrease the rate of de-gassing by reducing the pressure on underground reservoirs Stations that experience high levels of acids and volatile chemicals are usually equipped with emission-control systems to reduce the exhaust Geothermal stations can also inject these gases back into the earth as a form of carbon capture and storage such as in New Zealand and in the CarbFix project in Iceland Other stations like the K z ldere geothermal power plant exhibit the capability to use geothermal fluids to process carbon dioxide gas into dry ice at two nearby plants resulting in very little environmental impact In addition to dissolved gases hot water from geothermal sources may hold in solution trace amounts of toxic chemicals such as mercury arsenic boron antimony and salt These chemicals come out of solution as the water cools and can cause environmental damage if released The modern practice of injecting geothermal fluids back into the Earth to stimulate production has the side benefit of reducing this environmental risk Station construction can adversely affect land stability Subsidence has occurred in the Wairakei field in New Zealand Enhanced geothermal systems can trigger earthquakes due to water injection The project in Basel Switzerland was suspended because more than seismic events measuring up to on the Richter Scale occurred over the first days of water injection The risk of geothermal drilling leading to uplift has been experienced in Staufen im Breisgau Geothermal has minimal land and freshwater requirements Geothermal stations use square meters per GWh versus and square meters for coal facilities and wind farms respectively They use litres of freshwater per MWh versus over litres per MWh for nuclear coal or oil Local climate cooling is possible as a result of the work of the geothermal circulation systems However according to an estimation given by Leningrad Mining Institute in s possible cool-down will be negligible compared to natural climate fluctuations While volcanic activity produces geothermal energy it is also risky As of update the Puna Geothermal Venture has still not returned to full capacity after the lower Puna eruption Economics edit See also Cost of electricity by source Geothermal power requires no fuel it is therefore immune to fuel cost fluctuations However capital costs tend to be high Drilling accounts for over half the costs and exploration of deep resources entails significant risks A typical well doublet in Nevada can support MW of electricity generation and costs about million to drill with a failure rate In total electrical station construction and well drilling costs about million per MW of electrical capacity while the levelised energy cost is per kWh Enhanced geothermal systems tend to be on the high side of these ranges with capital costs above million per MW and levelized costs above per kWh in Research suggests in-reservoir storage could increase the economic viability of enhanced geothermal systems in energy systems with a large share of variable renewable energy sources Geothermal power is highly scalable a small power station can supply a rural village though initial capital costs can be high The most developed geothermal field is the Geysers in California In this field supported stations all owned by Calpine with a total generating capacity of MW See also

hydroelectric power is electricity generated from hydropower water power Hydropower supplies of the world s electricity almost TWh in which is more than all other renewable sources combined and also more than nuclear power Hydropower can provide large amounts of low-carbon electricity on demand making it a key element for creating secure and clean electricity supply systems A hydroelectric power station that has a dam and reservoir is a flexible source since the amount of electricity produced can be increased or decreased in seconds or minutes in response to varying electricity demand Once a hydroelectric complex is constructed it produces no direct waste and almost always emits considerably less greenhouse gas than fossil fuel -powered energy plants However when constructed in lowland rainforest areas where part of the forest is inundated substantial amounts of greenhouse gases may be emitted Construction of a hydroelectric complex can have significant environmental impact principally in loss of arable land and population displacement They also disrupt the natural ecology of the river involved affecting habitats and ecosystems and siltation and erosion patterns While dams can ameliorate the risks of flooding dam failure can be catastrophic In global installed hydropower electrical capacity reached almost GW the highest among all renewable energy technologies Hydroelectricity plays a leading role in countries like Brazil Norway and China but there are geographical limits and environmental issues Tidal power can be used in coastal regions China added GW in accounting for nearly three-quarters of global hydropower capacity additions Europe added GW the largest amount for the region since Meanwhile globally hydropower generation increased by TWh up in and remains the largest renewable energy source surpassing all other technologies combined History See also Hydropower History Museum Hydroelectric power plant Under the Town in U ice Serbia built in Hydropower has been used since ancient times to grind flour and perform other tasks In the late th century hydraulic power provided the energy source needed for the start of the Industrial Revolution In the mid- s French engineer Bernard Forest de B lidor published Architecture Hydraulique which described vertical- and horizontal-axis hydraulic machines and in Richard Arkwright s combination of water power the water frame and continuous production played a significant part in the development of the factory system with modern employment practices In the s hydraulic power networks were developed to generate and transmit hydro power to end users By the late th century the electrical generator was developed and could now be coupled with hydraulics The growing demand arising from the Industrial Revolution would drive development as well In the world s first hydroelectric power scheme was developed at Cragside in Northumberland England by William Armstrong It was used to power a single arc lamp in his art gallery The old Schoelkopf Power Station No US near Niagara Falls began to produce electricity in The first Edison hydroelectric power station the Vulcan Street Plant began operating September in Appleton Wisconsin with an output of about kilowatts By there were hydroelectric power stations in the United States and Canada and by there were in the United States alone The Warwick Castle water-powered generator house used for the generation of electricity for the castle from until At the beginning of the th century many small hydroelectric power stations were being constructed by commercial companies in mountains near metropolitan areas Grenoble France held the International Exhibition of Hydropower and Tourism with over one million visitors By when of the power produced in the United States was hydroelectric the Federal Power Act was enacted into law The Act created the Federal Power Commission to regulate hydroelectric power stations on federal land and water As the power stations became larger their associated dams developed additional purposes including flood control irrigation and navigation Federal funding became necessary for large-scale development and federally owned corporations such as the Tennessee Valley Authority and the Bonneville Power Administration were created Additionally the Bureau of Reclamation which had begun a series of western US irrigation projects in the early th century was now constructing large hydroelectric projects such as the Hoover Dam The United States Army Corps of Engineers was also involved in hydroelectric development completing the Bonneville Dam in and being recognized by the Flood Control Act of as the premier federal flood control agency Hydroelectric power stations continued to become larger throughout the th century Hydropower was referred to as white coal Hoover Dam s initial MW power station was the world s largest hydroelectric power station in it was eclipsed by the MW Grand Coulee Dam in The Itaipu Dam opened in in South America as the largest producing GW but was surpassed in by the Three Gorges Dam in China at GW Hydroelectricity would eventually supply some countries including Norway Democratic Republic of the Congo Paraguay and Brazil with over of their electricity Future potential In the International Energy Agency IEA said that more efforts are needed to help limit climate change Some countries have highly developed their hydropower potential and have very little room for growth Switzerland produces of its potential and Mexico In the IEA released a main-case forecast of GW generated by hydropower over which is slightly lower than deployment achieved from Because environmental permitting and construction times are long they estimate hydropower potential will remain limited with only an additional GW deemed possible in the accelerated case Modernization of existing infrastructure In the IEA said that major modernisation refurbishments are required Generating methods Cross-section of a conventional hydroelectric dam Pumped-storage Run-of-the-river Tidal Conventional dams See also List of conventional hydroelectric power stations Most hydroelectric power comes from the potential energy of dammed water driving a water turbine and generator The power extracted from the water depends on the volume and on the difference in height between the source and the water s outflow This height difference is called the head A large pipe the penstock delivers water from the reservoir to the turbine Pumped-storage Main article Pumped-storage hydroelectricity See also List of pumped-storage hydroelectric power stations This method produces electricity to supply high peak demands by moving water between reservoirs at different elevations At times of low electrical demand the excess generation capacity is used to pump water into the higher reservoir thus providing demand side response When the demand becomes greater water is released back into the lower reservoir through a turbine In pumped-storage schemes provided almost of the world s GW of grid energy storage and improve the daily capacity factor of the generation system Pumped storage is not an energy source and appears as a negative number in listings Run-of-the-river Main article Run-of-the-river hydroelectricity See also List of run-of-the-river hydroelectric power stations Run-of-the-river hydroelectric stations are those with small or no reservoir capacity so that only the water coming from upstream is available for generation at that moment and any oversupply must pass unused A constant supply of water from a lake or existing reservoir upstream is a significant advantage in choosing sites for run-of-the-river Tide Main article Tidal power See also List of tidal power stations A tidal power station makes use of the daily rise and fall of ocean water due to tides such sources are highly predictable and if conditions permit construction of reservoirs can also be dispatchable to generate power during high demand periods Less common types of hydro schemes use water s kinetic energy or undammed sources such as undershot water wheels Tidal power is viable in a relatively small number of locations around the world Conduit Main article Conduit hydroelectricity Conduit hydroelectricity stations use mechanical energy of water as part of the water delivery system through man-made conduits to generate electricity Generally the conduits are existing water pipelines such as in public water supply Some definitions expand the definition of conduits to be existing tunnels canals or aqueducts that are used primarily for other water delivery purposes than electricity generation Sizes types and capacities of hydroelectric facilities The classification of hydropower plants starts with two top-level categories small hydropower plants SHP and large hydropower plants LHP The classification of a plant as an SHP or LHP is primarily based on its nameplate capacity the threshold varies by the country but in any case a plant with the capacity of MW or more is considered an LHP As an example for China SHP power is below MW for India - below MW most of Europe - below MW The SHP and LHP categories are further subdivided into many subcategories that are not mutually exclusive For example a low-head hydro power plant with hydrostatic head of few meters to few tens of meters can be classified either as an SHP or an LHP The other distinction between SHP and LHP is the degree of the water flow regulation a typical SHP primarily uses the natural water discharge with very little regulation in comparison to an LHP Therefore the term SHP is frequently used as a synonym for the run-of-the-river power plant Large facilities See also List of largest power stations and List of largest hydroelectric power stations The largest power producers in the world are hydroelectric power stations with some hydroelectric facilities capable of generating more than double the installed capacities of the current largest nuclear power stations Although no official definition exists for the capacity range of large hydroelectric power stations facilities from over a few hundred megawatts are generally considered large hydroelectric facilities Currently only seven facilities over GW MW are

Panoramic view of the Itaipu Dam with the spillways closed at the time of the photo on the left In the American Society of Civil Engineers elected the Itaipu Dam as one of the Seven Wonders of the Modern World Small Main article Small hydro Small hydro is hydroelectric power on a scale serving a small community or industrial plant The definition of a small hydro project varies but a generating capacity of up to megawatts MW is generally accepted as the upper limit This may be stretched to MW and MW in Canada and the United States A micro-hydro facility in Vietnam Pico hydroelectricity in Mondulkiri Cambodia Small hydro stations may be connected to conventional electrical distribution networks as a source of low-cost renewable energy Alternatively small hydro projects may be built in isolated areas that would be uneconomic to serve from a grid or in areas where there is no national electrical distribution network Since small hydro projects usually have minimal reservoirs and civil construction work they are seen as having a relatively low environmental impact compared to large hydro This decreased environmental impact depends strongly on the balance between stream flow and power production citation needed Micro Main article Micro hydro Micro hydro means hydroelectric power installations that typically produce up to kW of power These installations can provide power to an isolated home or small community or are sometimes connected to electric power networks There are many of these installations around the world particularly in developing nations as they can provide an economical source of energy without purchase of fuel Micro hydro systems complement photovoltaic solar energy systems because in many areas water flow and thus available hydro power is highest in the winter when solar energy is at a minimum Pico Main article Pico hydro Pico hydro is hydroelectric power generation of under kW It is useful in small remote communities that require only a small amount of electricity For example the kW Intermediate Technology Development Group Pico Hydro Project in Kenya supplies homes with very small electric loads e g a couple of lights and a phone charger or a small TV radio Even smaller turbines of W may power a few homes in a developing country with a drop of only m ft A Pico-hydro setup is typically run-of-the-river meaning that dams are not used but rather pipes divert some of the flow drop this down a gradient and through the turbine before returning it to the stream Underground Main article Underground power station An underground power station is generally used at large facilities and makes use of a large natural height difference between two waterways such as a waterfall or mountain lake A tunnel is constructed to take water from the high reservoir to the generating hall built in a cavern near the lowest point of the water tunnel and a horizontal tailrace taking water away to the lower outlet waterway Measurement of the tailrace and forebay rates at the Limestone Generating Station in Manitoba Canada Calculating available power Main article Hydropower A simple formula for approximating electric power production at a hydroelectric station is P m g h V g h displaystyle P - eta dot m g Delta h - eta rho dot V g Delta h where P displaystyle P is power in watts displaystyle eta eta is the coefficient of efficiency a unitless scalar coefficient ranging from for completely inefficient to for completely efficient displaystyle rho rho is the density of water kg m V displaystyle dot V is the volumetric flow rate in m s m displaystyle dot m is the mass flow rate in kg s h displaystyle Delta h Delta h is the change in height in meters g displaystyle g is acceleration due to gravity m s Efficiency is often higher that is closer to with larger and more modern turbines Annual electric energy production depends on the available water supply In some installations the water flow rate can vary by a factor of over the course of a year citation needed Properties Advantages The Ffestiniog Power Station can generate MW of electricity within seconds of the demand arising Flexibility Hydropower is a flexible source of electricity since stations can be ramped up and down very quickly to adapt to changing energy demands Hydro turbines have a start-up time of the order of a few minutes Although battery power is quicker its capacity is tiny compared to hydro It takes less than minutes to bring most hydro units from cold start-up to full load this is quicker than nuclear and almost all fossil fuel power Power generation can also be decreased quickly when there is a surplus power generation Hence the limited capacity of hydropower units is not generally used to produce base power except for vacating the flood pool or meeting downstream needs Instead it can serve as backup for non-hydro generators High value power The major advantage of conventional hydroelectric dams with reservoirs is their ability to store water at low cost for dispatch later as high value clean electricity In the IEA estimated that the reservoirs of all existing conventional hydropower plants combined can store a total of terawatt-hours TWh of electrical energy in one full cycle which was about times more energy than the global fleet of pumped storage hydropower plants Battery storage capacity is not expected to overtake pumped storage during the s When used as peak power to meet demand hydroelectricity has a higher value than baseload power and a much higher value compared to intermittent energy sources such as wind and solar Hydroelectric stations have long economic lives with some plants still in service after years Operating labor cost is also usually low as plants are automated and have few personnel on site during normal operation Where a dam serves multiple purposes a hydroelectric station may be added with relatively low construction cost providing a useful revenue stream to offset the costs of dam operation It has been calculated that the sale of electricity from the Three Gorges Dam will cover the construction costs after to years of full generation However some data shows that in most countries large hydropower dams will be too costly and take too long to build to deliver a positive risk adjusted return unless appropriate risk management measures are put in place Suitability for industrial applications While many hydroelectric projects supply public electricity networks some are created to serve specific industrial enterprises Dedicated hydroelectric projects are often built to provide the substantial amounts of electricity needed for aluminium electrolytic plants for example The Grand Coulee Dam switched to support Alcoa aluminium in Bellingham Washington United States for American World War II airplanes before it was allowed to provide irrigation and power to citizens in addition to aluminium power after the war In Suriname the Brokopondo Reservoir was constructed to provide electricity for the Alcoa aluminium industry New Zealand s Manapouri Power Station was constructed to supply electricity to the aluminium smelter at Tiwai Point Reduced CO emissions Since hydroelectric dams do not use fuel power generation does not produce carbon dioxide While carbon dioxide is initially produced during construction of the project and some methane is given off annually by reservoirs hydro has one of the lowest lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions for electricity generation The low greenhouse gas impact of hydroelectricity is found especially in temperate climates Greater greenhouse gas emission impacts are found in the tropical regions because the reservoirs of power stations in tropical regions produce a larger amount of methane than those in temperate areas Like other non-fossil fuel sources hydropower also has no emissions of sulfur dioxide nitrogen oxides or other particulates Other uses of the reservoir Reservoirs created by hydroelectric schemes often provide facilities for water sports and become tourist attractions themselves In some countries aquaculture in reservoirs is common Multi-use dams installed for irrigation support agriculture with a relatively constant water supply Large hydro dams can control floods which would otherwise affect people living downstream of the project Managing dams which are also used for other purposes such as irrigation is complicated Disadvantages See also Renewable energy debate Disadvantages of hydroelectricity In the IEA called for robust sustainability standards for all hydropower development with streamlined rules and regulations Ecosystem damage and loss of land Merowe Dam in Sudan Hydroelectric power stations that use dams submerge large areas of land due to the requirement of a reservoir These changes to land color or albedo alongside certain projects that concurrently submerge rainforests can in these specific cases result in the global warming impact or equivalent life-cycle greenhouse gases of hydroelectricity projects to potentially exceed that of coal power stations Large reservoirs associated with traditional hydroelectric power stations result in submersion of extensive areas upstream of the dams sometimes destroying biologically rich and productive lowland and riverine valley forests marshland and grasslands Damming interrupts the flow of rivers and can harm local ecosystems and building large dams and reservoirs often involves displacing people and wildlife The loss of land is often exacerbated by habitat fragmentation of surrounding areas caused by the reservoir Hydroelectric projects can be disruptive to surrounding aquatic ecosystems both upstream and downstream of the plant site Generation of hydroelectric power changes the downstream river environment Water exiting a turbine usually contains very little suspended sediment which can lead to scouring of river beds and loss of riverbanks The turbines also will kill large portions of the fauna passing through for instance of the eel passing a turbine will perish immediately Since turbine gates are often opened intermittently rapid or even daily fluctuations in river flow are observed Drought and water loss by evaporation Drought and seasonal changes in rainfall can severely limit hydropower Water may also be lost by evaporation Siltation and flow shortage When water flows it has the ability to transport particles heavier than itself downstream This has a negative effect on dams and subsequently their power stations particularly those on rivers or within catchment areas with high siltation Siltation can fill a reservoir and reduce its capacity to control floods along with causing additional horizontal pressure on the upstream portion of the dam Eventually some reservoirs can become full of sediment and useless or over-top during a flood and fail Changes in the amount of river flow will correlate with the amount of energy produced by a dam Lower river flows will reduce the amount of live storage in a reservoir therefore reducing the amount of water that can be used for hydroelectricity The result of diminished river flow can be power shortages in areas that depend heavily on hydroelectric power The risk of flow shortage may increase as a result of climate change One study from the Colorado River in the United States suggest that modest climate changes such as an increase in temperature in degree Celsius resulting in a decline in precipitation might reduce river run-off by up to Brazil in particular is vulnerable due to its heavy reliance on hydroelectricity as increasing temperatures lower water flow and alterations in the rainfall regime could reduce total energy production by annually by the end of the century Methane emissions from reservoirs The Hoover Dam in the United States is a large conventional dammed-hydro facility with an installed capacity of MW See also Environmental impacts of reservoirs Lower positive impacts are found in the tropical regions In lowland rainforest areas where inundation of a part of the forest is necessary it has been noted that the reservoirs of power plants produce substantial amounts of methane This is due to plant material in flooded areas decaying in an anaerobic environment and forming methane a greenhouse gas According to the World Commission on Dams report where the reservoir is large compared to the generating capacity less than watts per square metre of surface area and no clearing of the forests in the area was undertaken prior to impoundment of the reservoir greenhouse gas emissions from the reservoir may be higher than those of a conventional oil-fired thermal generation plant In boreal reservoirs of Canada and Northern Europe however greenhouse gas emissions are typically only to of any kind of conventional fossil-fuel thermal generation A new class of underwater logging operation that targets drowned forests can mitigate the effect of forest decay Relocation Another disadvantage of hydroelectric dams is the need to relocate the people living where the reservoirs are planned In the World Commission on Dams estimated that dams had physically displaced million people worldwide Failure risks See also Dam failure and List of hydroelectric power station failures Because large conventional dammed-hydro facilities hold back large volumes of water a failure due to poor construction natural disasters or sabotage can be catastrophic to downriver settlements and infrastructure During Typhoon Nina in Banqiao Dam in Southern China failed when more than a year s worth of rain fell within hours see Banqiao Dam failure The resulting flood resulted in the deaths of people and another from epidemics Millions were left homeless The creation of a dam in a geologically inappropriate location may cause disasters such as disaster at Vajont Dam in Italy where almost people died The Malpasset Dam failure in Fr jus on the French Riviera C te d Azur southern France collapsed on December killing people in the resulting flood Smaller dams and micro hydro facilities create less risk but can form continuing hazards even after being decommissioned For example the small earthen embankment Kelly Barnes Dam failed in twenty years after its power station was decommissioned causing deaths Comparison and interactions with other methods of power generation This section needs to be updated The reason given is solar panels on reservoirs also Tasmania link Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information January Hydroelectricity eliminates the flue gas emissions from fossil fuel combustion including pollutants such as sulfur dioxide nitric oxide carbon monoxide dust and mercury in the coal Hydroelectricity also avoids the hazards of coal mining and the indirect health effects of coal emissions In the IEA said that government energy policy should price in the value of the multiple public benefits provided by hydropower plants Nuclear power Nuclear power is relatively inflexible although it can reduce its output reasonably quickly Since the cost of nuclear power is dominated by its high infrastructure costs the cost per unit energy goes up significantly with low production Because of this nuclear power is mostly used for baseload By way of contrast hydroelectricity can supply peak power at much lower cost Hydroelectricity is thus often used to complement nuclear or other sources for load following Country examples where they are paired in a close to share include the electric grid in Switzerland the Electricity sector in Sweden and to a lesser extent Ukraine and the Electricity sector in Finland Wind power Wind power goes through predictable variation by season but is intermittent on a daily basis Maximum wind generation has little relationship to peak daily electricity consumption the wind may peak at night when power is not needed or be still during the day when electrical demand is highest Occasionally weather patterns can result in low wind for days or weeks at a time a hydroelectric reservoir capable of storing weeks of output is useful to balance generation on the grid Peak wind power can be offset by minimum hydropower and minimum wind can be offset with maximum hydropower In this way the easily regulated character of hydroelectricity is used to compensate for the intermittent nature of wind power Conversely in some cases wind power can be used to spare water for later use in dry seasons An example of this is Norway s trading with Sweden Denmark the Netherlands Germany and the UK Norway is hydropower while its flatland neighbors have wind power In areas that do not have hydropower pumped storage serves a similar role but at a much higher cost and lower efficiency citation needed Hydro power by country Yearly hydro generation by continent Hydro generation by country See also List of countries

    "content": "Run-of-the-river hydroelectricity - Wikipedia Jump to content From Wikipedia the free encyclopedia Hydroelectric power station Chief Joseph Dam near Bridgeport Washington USA is a major run-of-the-river station without a sizeable reservoir A small and floating run-of-the-river power plant in Austria Run-of-river hydroelectricity ROR or run-of-the-river hydroelectricity is a type of hydroelectric generation plant whereby little or no water storage is provided Run-of-the-river power plants may have no water storage at all or a limited amount of storage in which case the storage reservoir is referred to as pondage A plant without pondage is subject to seasonal river flows so the plant will operate as an intermittent energy source Conventional hydro uses reservoirs which regulate water for flood control dispatchable electrical power and the provision of fresh water for agriculture Concept edit Mankala Power Station along the Kymi River in Iitti Finland Run-of-the-river or ROR hydroelectricity is considered ideal for streams or rivers that can sustain a minimum flow or those regulated by a lake or reservoir upstream A small dam is usually built to create a headpond ensuring that there is enough water entering the penstock pipes that lead to the turbines which are at a lower elevation Projects with pondage as opposed to those without pondage can store water for daily load demands In general projects divert some or most of a river s flow up to of mean annual discharge through a pipe and or tunnel leading to electricity-generating turbines then return the water back to the river downstream Run-of-the-river projects are dramatically different in design and appearance from conventional hydroelectric projects Traditional hydroelectric dams store enormous quantities of water in reservoirs sometimes flooding large tracts of land In contrast run-of-river projects do not have the disadvantages associated with reservoirs and so cause fewer environmental impacts Saint Marys Falls run of the river The use of the term run-of-the-river for power projects varies around the world Some may consider a project run-of-the-river if power is produced with no water storage but limited storage is considered run-of-the-river by others Developers may mislabel a project run-of-the-river to soothe public perception about its environmental or social effects The European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity distinguishes run-of-the-river and pondage hydropower plants which can hold enough water to allow generation for up to hours reservoir capacity generating capacity hours from reservoir hydropower plants which hold far more than hours of generation without pumps The Bureau of Indian Standards describes run-of-the-river hydroelectricity as A power station utilizing the run of the river flows for generation of power with sufficient pondage for supplying water for meeting diurnal or weekly fluctuations of demand In such stations the normal course of the river is not materially altered Many of the larger run-of-the-river projects have been designed to a scale and generating capacity rivaling some traditional hydroelectric dams For example the Beauharnois Hydroelectric Generating Station in Quebec is rated at MW Some run-of-the-river projects are downstream of other dams and reservoirs The reservoir was not built by the project but takes advantage of the water supplied by it An example would be the MW La Grande- generating station Previous upstream dams and reservoirs were part of the s James Bay Project There are also small and somewhat-mobile forms of a run-of-the-river power plants One example is the so-called electricity buoy a small floating hydroelectric power plant Like most buoys it is anchored to the ground in this case in a river The energy within the moving water propels a power generator and thereby creates electricity Prototypes by commercial producers are generating power on the Middle Rhine river in Germany and on the Danube river in Austria Major types edit The advantages and disadvantages of run-of-river dams depends on the type the following sections generally refer to Dam-Toe unless otherwise stated These are listed in order of least impact to most impact as well as on average requisite project size Dam-Toe edit Dam-toe has no flow regulation and utilizes the natural flow of the river to turn the turbines Electricity generation is heavily dependent on river flow Diversion Weir edit Diversion Weir has very little flow regulation which is generally used to cover exclusively short-term peak times electricity demand Diversion Weir is also heavily dependent on the natural river flow Pondage edit Similar to a regular dam water is stored from lull periods to be used during peak-times This allows for the pondage dams to provide for the regulation of daily and or weekly flows depending on location Advantages edit When developed with care to footprint size and location run-of-the-river hydro projects can create sustainable energy minimizing impacts to the surrounding environment and nearby communities Run-of-the-river harnesses the natural potential energy of water by eliminating the need to burn coal or natural gas to generate the electricity needed by consumers and industry Advantages include Cleaner power and fewer greenhouse gases edit Like all hydro-electric power run-of-the-river harnesses the natural potential energy of water by eliminating the need to burn coal or natural gas to generate the electricity needed by consumers and industry Moreover run-of-the-river hydroelectric plants do not have reservoirs thus eliminating the methane and carbon dioxide emissions caused by the decomposition of organic matter in the reservoir of a conventional hydroelectric dam That is a particular advantage in tropical countries where methane generation can be a problem Less flooding edit Without a reservoir flooding of the upper part of the river does not take place As a result people remain living at or near the river and existing habitats are not flooded Any pre-existing pattern of flooding will continue unaltered which presents a flood risk to the facility and downstream areas Low-Impact Implementation edit Due to their low impact run-of-the-river dams can be implemented in existing irrigation dams with little to no change in the local fluvial ecosystem Disadvantages edit Unfirm power edit Run-of-the-river power is considered an unfirm source of power a run-of-the-river project has little or no capacity for energy storage and so cannot co-ordinate the output of electricity generation to match consumer demand It thus generates much more power when seasonal river flows are high spring freshet and depending on location much less during drier summer months or frozen winter months Depending on location and type the plant will most likely have a lower head of water than from a dam and will thus generate less power Availability of sites edit Rapids can provide enough hydraulic head The potential power at a site is a result of the head and flow of water By damming a river the head is available to generate power at the face of the dam A dam may create a reservoir hundreds of kilometres long but in run-of-the-river the head is usually delivered by a canal pipe or tunnel constructed upstream of the power house The cost of upstream construction makes a steep drop desirable such as falls or rapids Environmental impacts edit Small well-sited run-of-the-river projects can be developed with minimal environmental impacts Larger projects have more environmental concerns For fish-bearing rivers a ladder may be required and dissolved gases downstream may affect fish In British Columbia the mountainous terrain and wealth of big rivers have made it a global testing ground for MW run-of-river technology As of March there were applications pending for new water licences solely for power generation representing more than potential points of river diversion In undeveloped areas new access roads and transmission lines can cause habitat fragmentation allowing the introduction of invasive species Vulnerable to climate change edit Run-of-the-river projects strongly depend on the consistent flow of water as they lack reservoirs and depend on the natural flow of rivers Consequently these projects are more vulnerable to climate change compared to storage-based projects Short-term climate anomalies such as the El Ni o Southern Oscillation ENSO can significantly disrupt the flow and can have a profound impact on the operation of these projects Thus incorporating climate change considerations into the initial design and location selection of

Rapid transit Personal rapid transit Category Renewable energy portal v t e Hydropower from Ancient Greek - water also known as water power or water energy is the use of falling or fast-running water to produce electricity or to power machines This is achieved by converting the gravitational potential or kinetic energy of a water source to produce power Hydropower is a method of sustainable energy production Hydropower is now used principally for hydroelectric power generation and is also applied as one half of an energy storage system known as pumped-storage hydroelectricity Hydropower is an attractive alternative to fossil fuels as it does not directly produce carbon dioxide or other atmospheric pollutants and it provides a relatively consistent source of power Nonetheless it has economic sociological and environmental downsides and requires a sufficiently energetic source of water such as a river or elevated lake International institutions such as the World Bank view hydropower as a low-carbon means for economic development Since ancient times hydropower from watermills has been used as a renewable energy source for irrigation and the operation of mechanical devices such as gristmills sawmills textile mills trip hammers dock cranes domestic lifts and ore mills A trompe which produces compressed air from falling water is sometimes used to power other machinery at a distance Calculating the amount of available power edit A hydropower resource can be evaluated by its available power Power is a function of the hydraulic head and volumetric flow rate The head is the energy per unit weight or unit mass of water The static head is proportional to the difference in height through which the water falls The Dynamic head is related to the velocity of moving water Each unit of water can do an amount of work equal to its weight times the head Calculator Efficiency Flow rate m s Head m Density kg m Acceleration m s Power kW Capacity factor Annual

text m text s text MW Operators of hydroelectric stations compare the total electrical energy produced with the theoretical potential energy of the water passing through the turbine to calculate efficiency Procedures and definitions for the calculation of efficiency are given in test codes such as ASME PTC and IEC Field testing of turbines is used to validate the manufacturer s efficiency guarantee Detailed calculation of the efficiency of a hydropower turbine accounts for the head lost due to flow friction in the power canal or penstock rise in tailwater level due to flow the location of the station and effect of varying gravity the air temperature and barometric pressure the density of the water at ambient temperature and the relative altitudes of the forebay and tailbay For precise calculations errors due to rounding and the number of significant digits of constants must be considered Some hydropower systems such as water wheels can draw power from the flow of a body of water without necessarily changing its height In this case the available power is the kinetic energy of the flowing water Over-shot water wheels can efficiently capture both types of energy The flow in a stream can vary widely from season to season The development of a hydropower site requires analysis of flow records sometimes spanning decades to assess the reliable annual energy supply Dams and reservoirs provide a more dependable source of power by smoothing seasonal changes in water flow However reservoirs have a significant environmental impact as does alteration of naturally occurring streamflow Dam design must account for the worst-case probable maximum flood that can be expected at the site a spillway is often included to route flood flows around the dam A computer model of the hydraulic basin and rainfall and snowfall records are used to predict the maximum flood citation needed Disadvantages and limitations edit Main articles Hydroelectricity Disadvantages and Renewable energy debate Hydroelectricity Some disadvantages of hydropower have been identified Dam failures can have catastrophic effects including loss of life property and pollution of land Dams and reservoirs can have major negative impacts on river ecosystems such as preventing some animals from traveling upstream cooling and de-oxygenating of water released downstream and loss of nutrients due to settling of particulates River sediment builds river deltas and dams prevent them from restoring what is lost from erosion Furthermore studies found that the construction of dams and reservoirs can result in habitat loss for some aquatic species A hydropower scheme which harnesses the power of the water which pours down from the Brecon Beacons mountains Wales Large and deep dam and reservoir plants cover large areas of land which causes greenhouse gas emissions from underwater rotting vegetation Furthermore although at lower levels than other renewable energy sources citation needed it was found that hydropower produces methane CH equivalent to almost a billion tonnes of CO greenhouse gas a year This occurs when organic matters accumulate at the bottom of the reservoir because of the deoxygenation of water which triggers anaerobic digestion People who live near a hydro plant site are displaced during construction or when reservoir banks become unstable Another potential disadvantage is that cultural or religious sites may block construction note Applications edit A shishi-odoshi powered by falling water breaks the quietness of a Japanese garden with the sound of a bamboo rocker arm hitting a rock Mechanical power edit Watermills edit This section is an excerpt from Watermill edit Watermill of Braine-le-Ch teau Belgium th century Interior of the Lyme Regis watermill UK th century A watermill or water mill is a mill that uses hydropower It is a structure that uses a water wheel or water turbine to drive a mechanical process such as milling grinding rolling or hammering Such processes are needed in the production of many material goods including flour lumber paper textiles and many metal products These watermills may comprise gristmills sawmills paper mills textile mills hammermills trip hammering mills rolling mills and wire drawing mills One major way to classify watermills is by wheel orientation vertical or horizontal one powered by a vertical waterwheel through a gear mechanism and the other equipped with a horizontal waterwheel without such a mechanism The former type can be further subdivided depending on where the water hits the wheel paddles into undershot overshot breastshot and pitchback backshot or reverse shot waterwheel mills Another way to classify water mills is by an essential trait about their location tide mills use the movement of the tide ship mills are water mills onboard and constituting a ship Watermills impact the river dynamics of the watercourses where they are installed During the time watermills operate channels tend to sedimentate particularly backwater Also in the backwater area inundation events and sedimentation of adjacent floodplains increase Over time however these effects are cancelled by river banks becoming higher Where mills have been removed river incision increases and channels deepen Rail transport edit This section is an excerpt from Water balance railway edit A water balance railway is a funicular aerial tramway or cable railway that uses the weight of water to move its carriages Compressed air edit See also Trompe A plentiful head of water can be made to generate compressed air directly without moving parts In these designs a falling column of water is deliberately mixed with air bubbles generated through turbulence or a venturi pressure reducer at the high-level intake This allows it to fall down a shaft into a subterranean high-roofed chamber where the now-compressed air separates from the water and becomes trapped The height of the falling water column maintains compression of the air in the top of the chamber while an outlet submerged below the water level in the chamber allows water to flow back to the surface at a lower level than the intake A separate outlet in the roof of the chamber supplies the compressed air A facility on this principle was built on the Montreal River at Ragged Shutes near Cobalt Ontario in and supplied horsepower to nearby mines Electricity edit Main article Hydroelectricity Hydroelectricity is the biggest hydropower application Hydroelectricity generates about of global electricity and provides at least of the total electricity supply for more than countries In global installed hydropower electrical capacity reached almost GW the highest among all renewable energy technologies Hydroelectricity generation starts with converting either the potential energy of water that is present due to the site s elevation or the kinetic energy of moving water into electrical energy Hydroelectric power plants vary in terms of the way they harvest energy One type involves a dam and a reservoir The water in the reservoir is available on demand to be used to generate electricity by passing through channels that connect the dam to the reservoir The water spins a turbine which is connected to the generator that produces electricity The other type is called a run-of-river plant In this case a barrage is built to control the flow of water absent a reservoir The run-of river power plant needs continuous water flow and therefore has less ability to provide power on demand The kinetic energy of flowing water is the main source of energy Both designs have limitations For example dam construction can result in discomfort to nearby residents The dam and reservoirs occupy a relatively large amount of space that may be opposed by nearby communities Moreover reservoirs can potentially have major environmental consequences such as harming downstream habitats On the other hand the limitation of the run-of-river project is the decreased efficiency of electricity generation because the process depends on the speed of the seasonal river flow This means that the rainy season increases electricity generation compared to the dry season The size of hydroelectric plants can vary from small plants called micro hydro to large plants that supply power to a whole country As of the five largest power stations in the world are conventional hydroelectric power stations with dams Hydroelectricity can also be used to store energy in the form of potential energy between two reservoirs at different heights with pumped-storage Water is pumped uphill into reservoirs during periods of low demand to be released for generation when demand is high or system generation is low Other forms of electricity generation with hydropower include tidal stream generators using energy from tidal power generated from oceans rivers and human-made canal systems to generating electricity A conventional dammed-hydro facility hydroelectric dam is the most common type of hydroelectric power generation Chief Joseph Dam near Bridgeport Washington is a major run-of-the-river station without a sizeable reservoir Micro hydro in Northwest Vietnam The upper reservoir and dam of the Ffestiniog Pumped Storage Scheme in Wales The lower power station can generate MW of electricity Rain power edit Billions of litres of rainwater can fall which can generate huge amounts of electrical energy if used in the right way Research is being done into the different methods of generating power from rain such as by using the energy in the impact of raindrops This is in its very early stages with new and emerging technologies being tested prototyped and created Such power has been called rain power One way in which this has been tried is by using hybrid solar panels called all-weather solar panels that can generate electricity from both the sun and the rain According to zoologist and science and technology educator Luis Villazon a French study estimated that you could use piezoelectric devices which generate power when they move to extract milliwatts from a raindrop clarification needed An individual raindrop is not a continuous process so its electrical output must be measured in joules not watts Over a year this would amount to less than Wh per square metre enough to power a remote sensor Villazon suggested a better application would be to collect the water from fallen rain and use it to drive a turbine with an estimated energy generation of kWh of energy per year for a m roof A microturbine-based system created by three students from the Technological University of Mexico has been used to generate electricity The Pluvia system uses the stream of rainwater runoff from houses rooftop rain gutters to spin a microturbine in a cylindrical housing Electricity generated by that turbine is used to charge -volt batteries The term rain power has also been applied to hydropower systems which include the process of capturing the rain History edit Ancient history edit A water piston from the Nongshu by Wang Zhen fl Saint Anthony Falls United States hydropower was used here to mill flour Directly water-powered ore mill late nineteenth century Evidence suggests that the fundamentals of hydropower date to ancient Greek civilization Other evidence indicates that the waterwheel independently emerged in China around the same period Evidence of water wheels and watermills date to the ancient Near East in the th century BC Moreover evidence indicates the use of hydropower using irrigation machines to ancient civilizations such as Sumer and Babylonia Studies suggest that the water wheel was the initial form of water power In the Roman Empire water-powered mills were described by Vitruvius by the first century BC The Barbegal mill located in modern-day France had water wheels processing up to tons of grain per day Roman waterwheels were also used for sawing marble such as the Hierapolis sawmill of the late rd century AD Such sawmills had a waterwheel that drove two crank-and-connecting rods to power two saws It also appears in two th century Eastern Roman sawmills excavated at Ephesus and Gerasa respectively The crank and connecting rod mechanism of these Roman watermills converted the rotary motion of the waterwheel into the linear movement of the saw blades Water-powered trip hammers and bellows in China during the Han dynasty BC AD were initially thought to be powered by water scoops However some historians suggested that they were powered by waterwheels This is since it was theorized that water scoops would not have had the motive force to operate their blast furnace bellows Many texts describe the Hun waterwheel some of the earliest ones are the Jijiupian dictionary of BC Yang Xiong s text known as the Fangyan of BC as well as Xin Lun written by Huan Tan about AD It was also during this time that the engineer Du Shi c AD applied the power of waterwheels to piston - bellows in forging cast iron Ancient Indian texts dating back to the th century BC refer to the term cakkavattaka turning wheel which commentaries explain as arahatta-ghati-yanta machine with wheel-pots attached however whether this is water or hand powered is disputed by scholars On this basis Joseph Needham suggested that the machine was a noria Terry S Reynolds however argues that the term used in Indian texts is ambiguous and does not clearly indicate a water-powered device This quote needs a citation Thorkild Schi ler argued that it is more likely that these passages refer to some type of tread- or hand-operated water-lifting device instead of a water-powered water-lifting wheel This quote needs a citation India received Roman water mills and baths in the early th century AD according to Greek sources Dams spillways reservoirs channels and water balance would develop in India during the Mauryan Gupta and Chola empires Another example of the early use of hydropower is seen in hushing a historic method of mining that uses flood or torrent of water to reveal mineral veins The method was first used at the Dolaucothi Gold Mines in Wales from AD onwards This method was further developed in Spain in mines such as Las M dulas Hushing was also widely used in Britain in the Medieval and later periods to extract lead and tin ores It later evolved into hydraulic mining when used during the California Gold Rush in the th century The Islamic Empire spanned a large region mainly in Asia and Africa along with other surrounding areas During the Islamic Golden Age and the Arab Agricultural Revolution th th centuries hydropower was widely used and developed Early uses of tidal power emerged along with large hydraulic factory complexes A wide range of water-powered industrial mills were used in the region including fulling mills gristmills paper mills hullers sawmills ship mills stamp mills steel mills sugar mills and tide mills By the th century every province throughout the Islamic Empire had these industrial mills in operation from Al-Andalus and North Africa to the Middle East and Central Asia Muslim engineers also used water turbines while employing gears in watermills and water-raising machines They also pioneered the use of dams as a source of water power used to provide additional power to watermills and water-raising machines Islamic irrigation techniques including Persian Wheels would be introduced to India and would be combined with local methods during the Delhi Sultanate and the Mughal Empire Furthermore in his book The Book of Knowledge of Ingenious Mechanical Devices the Muslim mechanical engineer Al-Jazari described designs for devices Many of these devices were water-powered including clocks a device to serve wine and five devices to lift water from rivers or pools where three of them are animal-powered and one can be powered by animal or water Moreover they included an endless belt with jugs attached a cow-powered shadoof a crane-like irrigation tool and a reciprocating device with hinged valves Beno t Fourneyron the French engineer who developed the first hydropower turbine th century edit In the th century French engineer Beno t Fourneyron developed the first hydropower turbine This device was implemented in the commercial plant of Niagara Falls in and it is still operating In the early th century English engineer William Armstrong built and operated the first private electrical power station which was located in his house in Cragside in Northumberland England In the French engineer Bernard Forest de B lidor published his book Architecture Hydraulique which described vertical-axis and horizontal-axis hydraulic machines The growing demand for the Industrial Revolution would drive development as well At the beginning of the Industrial Revolution in Britain water was the main power source for new inventions such as Richard Arkwright s water frame Although water power gave way to steam power in many of the larger mills and factories it was still used during the th and th centuries for many smaller operations such as driving the bellows in small blast furnaces e g the Dyfi Furnace and gristmills such as those built at Saint Anthony Falls which uses the -foot m drop in the Mississippi River Technological advances moved the open water wheel into an enclosed turbine or water motor In the British-American engineer James B Francis head engineer of Lowell s Locks and Canals company improved on these designs to create a turbine with efficiency He applied scientific principles and testing methods to the problem of turbine design His mathematical and graphical calculation methods allowed the confident design of high-efficiency turbines to exactly match a site s specific flow conditions The Francis reaction turbine is still in use In the s deriving from uses in the California mining industry Lester Allan Pelton developed the high-efficiency Pelton wheel impulse turbine which used hydropower from the high head streams characteristic of the Sierra Nevada citation needed th century edit The modern history of hydropower begins in the s with large dams built not simply to power neighboring mills or factories but provide extensive electricity for increasingly distant groups of people Competition drove much of the global hydroelectric craze Europe competed amongst itself to electrify first and the United States hydroelectric plants in Niagara Falls and the Sierra Nevada inspired bigger and bolder creations across the globe American and USSR financers and hydropower experts also spread the gospel of dams and hydroelectricity across the globe during the Cold War contributing to projects such as the Three Gorges Dam and the Aswan High Dam Feeding desire for large scale electrification with water inherently required large dams across powerful rivers which impacted public and private interests downstream and in flood zones Inevitably smaller communities and marginalized groups suffered They were unable to successfully resist companies flooding them out of their homes or blocking traditional salmon passages The stagnant water created by hydroelectric dams provides breeding ground for pests and pathogens leading to local epidemics However in some cases a mutual need for hydropower could lead to cooperation between otherwise adversarial nations Hydropower technology and attitude began to shift in the second half of the th century While countries had largely abandoned their small hydropower systems by the s the smaller hydropower plants began to make a comeback in the s boosted by government subsidies and a push for more independent energy producers Some politicians who once advocated for large hydropower projects in the first half of the th century began to speak out against them and citizen groups organizing against dam projects increased In the s and s the international anti-dam movement had made finding government or private investors for new large hydropower projects incredibly difficult and given rise to NGOs devoted to fighting dams Additionally while the cost of other energy sources fell the cost of building new hydroelectric dams increased annually between and due both to the increasing costs of construction and to the decrease in high quality building sites In the s only of the world s electricity came from hydropower Tidal power production also emerged in the s as a burgeoning alternative hydropower system though still has not taken hold as a strong energy contender United States edit Especially at the start of the American hydropower experiment engineers and politicians began major hydroelectricity projects to solve a problem of wasted potential rather than to power a population that needed the electricity When the Niagara Falls Power Company began looking into damming Niagara the first major hydroelectric project in the United States in the s they struggled to transport electricity from the falls far enough away to actually reach enough people and justify installation The project succeeded in large part due to Nikola Tesla s invention of the alternating current motor On the other side of the country San Francisco engineers the Sierra Club and the federal government fought over acceptable use of the Hetch Hetchy Valley Despite ostensible protection within a national park city engineers successfully won the rights to both water and power in the Hetch Hetchy Valley in After their victory they delivered Hetch Hetchy hydropower and water to San Francisco a decade later and at twice the promised cost selling power to PG E which resold to San Francisco residents at a profit The American West with its mountain rivers and lack of coal turned to hydropower early and often especially along the Columbia River and its tributaries The Bureau of Reclamation built the Hoover Dam in symbolically linking the job creation and economic growth priorities of the New Deal The federal government quickly followed Hoover with the Shasta Dam and Grand Coulee Dam Power demand in Oregon did not justify damming the Columbia until WWI revealed the weaknesses of a coal-based energy economy The federal government then began prioritizing interconnected power and lots of it Electricity from all three dams poured into war production during WWII After the war the Grand Coulee Dam and accompanying hydroelectric projects electrified almost all of the rural Columbia Basin but failed to improve the lives of those living and farming there the way its boosters had promised and also damaged the river ecosystem and migrating salmon populations In the s as well the federal government took advantage of the sheer amount of unused power and flowing water from the Grand Coulee to build a nuclear site placed on the banks of the Columbia The nuclear site leaked radioactive matter into the river contaminating the entire area Post-WWII Americans especially engineers from the Tennessee Valley Authority refocused from simply building domestic dams to promoting hydropower abroad While domestic dam building continued well into the s with the Reclamation Bureau and Army Corps of Engineers building more than new dams across the American West organized opposition to hydroelectric dams sparked up in the s and s based on environmental concerns Environmental movements successfully shut down proposed hydropower dams in Dinosaur National Monument and the Grand Canyon and gained more hydropower-fighting tools with s environmental legislation As nuclear and fossil fuels grew in the s and s and environmental activists push for river restoration hydropower gradually faded in American importance Africa edit Foreign powers and IGOs have frequently used hydropower projects in Africa as a tool to interfere in the economic development of African countries such as the World Bank with the Kariba and Akosombo Dams and the Soviet Union with the Aswan Dam The Nile River especially has borne the consequences of countries both along the Nile and distant foreign actors using the river to expand their economic power or national force After the British occupation of Egypt in the British worked with Egypt to construct the first Aswan Dam which they heightened in and to try to hold back the Nile floods Egyptian engineer Adriano Daninos developed a plan for the Aswan High Dam inspired by the Tennessee Valley Authority s multipurpose dam When Gamal Abdel Nasser took power in the s his government decided to undertake the High Dam project publicizing it as an economic development project After American refusal to help fund the dam and anti-British sentiment in Egypt and British interests in neighboring Sudan combined to make the United Kingdom pull out as well the Soviet Union funded the Aswan High Dam Between and the dam s turbines generated one third of Egypt s electricity The building of the Aswan Dam triggered a dispute between Sudan and Egypt over the sharing of the Nile especially since the dam flooded part of Sudan and decreased the volume of water available to them Ethiopia also located on the Nile took advantage of the Cold War tensions to request assistance from the United States for their own irrigation and hydropower investments in the s While progress stalled due to the coup d tat of and following -year-long Ethiopian Civil War Ethiopia began construction on the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam in Beyond the Nile hydroelectric projects cover the rivers and lakes of Africa The Inga powerplant on the Congo River had been discussed since Belgian colonization in the late th century and was successfully built after independence Mobutu s government failed to regularly maintain the plants and their capacity declined until the formation of the Southern African Power Pool created a multi-national power grid and plant maintenance program States with an abundance of hydropower such as the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Ghana frequently sell excess power to neighboring countries Foreign actors such as Chinese hydropower companies have proposed a significant amount of new hydropower projects in Africa and already funded and consulted on many others in countries like Mozambique and Ghana Small hydropower also played an important role in early th century electrification across Africa In South Africa small turbines powered gold mines and the first electric railway in the s and Zimbabwean farmers installed small hydropower stations in the s While interest faded as national grids improved in the second half of the century st century national governments in countries including South Africa and Mozambique as well as NGOs serving countries like Zimbabwe have begun re-exploring small-scale hydropower to diversify power sources and improve rural electrification Europe edit In the early th century two major factors motivated the expansion of hydropower in Europe in the northern countries of Norway and Sweden high rainfall and mountains proved exceptional resources for abundant hydropower and in the south coal shortages pushed governments and utility companies to seek alternative power sources Early on Switzerland dammed the Alpine rivers and the Swiss Rhine creating along with Italy and Scandinavia a Southern Europe hydropower race In Italy s Po Valley the main th-century transition was not the creation of hydropower but the transition from mechanical to electrical hydropower watermills churned in the Po watershed in the s but the first commercial hydroelectric plant completed in signaled the end of the mechanical reign These new large plants moved power away from rural mountainous areas to urban centers in the lower plain Italy prioritized early near-nationwide electrification almost entirely from hydropower which powered its rise as a dominant European and imperial force However they failed to reach any conclusive standard for determining water rights before WWI Modern German hydropower dam construction was built on a history of small dams powering mines and mills in the th century Some parts of the German industry relied more on waterwheels than steam until the s The German government did not set out building large dams such as the prewar Urft Mohne and Eder dams to expand hydropower they mostly wanted to reduce flooding and improve irrigation However hydropower quickly emerged as a bonus for all these dams especially in the coal-poor south Bavaria even achieved a statewide power grid by damming the Walchensee in inspired in part by loss of coal reserves after WWI Hydropower became a symbol of regional pride and distaste for northern coal barons although the north also held strong enthusiasm for hydropower Dam building rapidly increased after WWII aiming to increase hydropower However conflict accompanied the dam building and spread of hydropower agrarian interests suffered from decreased irrigation small mills lost water flow and different interest groups fought over where dams should be located controlling who benefited and whose homes they drowned See also edit Energy portal

    "content": "Micro hydro - Wikipedia Jump to content From Wikipedia the free encyclopedia Hydroelectric power generation of to kW of electricity Micro hydro in northwest Vietnam Micro hydro is a type of hydroelectric power that typically produces from kW to kW of electricity using the natural flow of water Installations below kW are called pico hydro These installations can provide power to an isolated home or small community or are sometimes connected to electric power networks particularly where net metering is offered There are many of these installations around the world particularly in developing nations as they can provide an economical source of energy without the purchase of fuel Micro hydro systems complement solar PV power systems because in many areas water flow and thus available hydro power is highest in the winter when solar energy is at a minimum Micro hydro is frequently accomplished with a pelton wheel for high head low flow water supply The installation is often when where just a small dammed pool at the top of a waterfall with several hundred feet of pipe leading to a small generator housing In low head sites example needed generally water wheels and Archimedes screws are used citation needed Construction edit Typical microhydro setup Construction details of a microhydro plant are site-specific Sometimes an existing mill-pond or other artificial reservoir is available and can be adapted for power production In general microhydro systems are made up of a number of components The most important include the intake where water is diverted from the natural stream river or perhaps a waterfall An intake structure such as a catch box is required to screen out floating debris and fish using a screen or array of bars to keep out large objects In temperate climates this structure must resist ice as well The intake may have a gate to allow the system to be dewatered for inspection and maintenance The intake is then brought through a canal and then forebay The forebay is used for sediment holding At the bottom of the system the water is tunneled through a pipeline penstock to the powerhouse building containing a turbine The penstock builds up pressure from the water that has traveled downwards In mountainous areas access to the route of the penstock may provide considerable challenges If the water source and turbine are far apart the construction of the penstock may be the largest part of the costs of construction At the turbine a controlling valve is installed to regulate the flow and the speed of the turbine The turbine converts the flow and pressure of the water to mechanical energy the water emerging from the turbine returns to the natural watercourse along a tailrace channel The turbine turns a generator which is then connected to electrical loads this might be directly connected to the power system of a single building in very small installations or may be connected to a community distribution system for several homes or buildings Usually microhydro installations do not have a dam and reservoir like large hydroelectric plants have relying on a minimal flow of water to be available year-round Head and flow characteristics edit Microhydro systems are typically set up in areas capable of producing up to kilowatts of electricity This can power a home or small business facility This production range is calculated in terms of head and flow The higher each of these are the more power available Hydraulic head is the pressure measurement of water falling in a pipe expressed as a function of the vertical distance the water falls This change in elevation is usually measured in feet or meters A drop of at least feet is required or the system may not be feasible When quantifying head both gross and net head must be considered Gross head approximates power accessibility through the vertical distance measurement alone whereas net head subtracts pressure lost due to friction in piping from the gross head Flow is the actual quantity of water falling from a site and is usually measured in gallons per minute cubic feet per second or liters per second Low flow high head installations in steep terrain have significant pipe costs A long penstock starts with low pressure pipe at the top and progressively higher pressure pipe closer to the turbine in order to reduce pipe costs The available power in kilowatts from such a system can be calculated by the equation P Q H k where Q is the flow rate in gallons per minute H is the static head and k is a constant of gal ft min kW For instance for a system with a flow of gallons per minute and a static head of feet the theoretical maximum power output is kW The system is prevented from efficiency from obtaining all kW due to the real world such as turbine efficiency friction in pipe and conversion from potential to kinetic energy Turbine efficiency is generally between - and pipe friction is accounted for using the Hazen Williams equation Regulation and operation edit Typically an automatic controller operates the turbine inlet valve to maintain constant speed and frequency when the load changes on the generator In a system connected to a grid with multiple sources the turbine control ensures that power always flows out from the generator to the system The frequency of the alternating current generated needs to match the local standard utility frequency In some systems if the useful load on the generator is not high enough a load bank may be automatically connected to the generator to dissipate energy not required by the load while this wastes energy it may be required if it s not possible to control the water flow through the turbine An induction generator always operates at the grid frequency irrespective of its rotation speed all that is necessary is to ensure that it is driven by the turbine faster than the synchronous speed so that it generates power rather than consuming it Other types of generator can use a speed control systems for frequency matching With the availability of modern power electronics it is often easier to operate the generator at an arbitrary frequency and feed its output through an inverter which produces output at grid frequency Power electronics now allow the use of permanent magnet alternators that produce wild AC to be stabilised This approach allows low speed low head water turbines to be competitive they can run at the best speed for extraction of energy and the power frequency is controlled by the electronics instead of the generator Very small installations pico hydro a few kilowatts or smaller may generate direct current and charge batteries for peak use times citation needed Turbine types edit Several types of water turbines can be used in micro hydro installations selection depending on the head of water the volume of flow and such factors as availability of local maintenance and transport of equipment to the site For hilly regions where a waterfall of meters or more may be available a Pelton wheel can be used For low head installations Francis or propeller-type turbines are used Very low head installations of only a few meters may use propeller-type turbines in a pit or water wheels and Archimedes screws Small micro hydro installations may successfully use industrial centrifugal pumps run in reverse as prime movers while the efficiency may not be as high as a purpose-built runner the relatively low cost makes the projects economically feasible In low-head installations maintenance and mechanism costs can be relatively high A low-head system moves larger amounts of water and is more likely to encounter surface debris For this reason a Banki turbine also called Ossberger turbine a pressurized self-cleaning crossflow waterwheel is often preferred for low-head micro hydro systems Though less efficient its simpler structure is less expensive than other low-head turbines of the same capacity Since the water flows in then out of it it cleans itself and is less prone to jam with debris Screw turbine Reverse Archimedes screw two low-head schemes in England Settle Hydro and Torrs Hydro use an Archimedes screw which is another debris-tolerant design Efficiency Gorlov the Gorlov helical turbine free stream or constrained flow with or without a dam Francis and propeller turbines Kaplan turbine Is a high flow low head propeller-type turbine An alternative to the traditional kaplan turbine is a large diameter slow turning permanent magnet sloped open flow VLH turbine with efficiencies of Water wheel advanced hydraulic water wheels and hydraulic wheel-part reaction turbine can have hydraulic efficiencies of and respectively Overshot water wheel maximum efficiency hydraulic efficiency is Undershot water wheels can operate with very low head but also have efficiencies below Gravitation water vortex power plant part of the river flow at a weir or natural water fall is diverted into a round basin with a central bottom exit that creates a vortex A simple rotor and connected generator is moved by the kinetic energy Efficiencies of down to at part flow citation needed Use edit Microhydro systems are very flexible and can be deployed in a number of different environments They are dependent on how much water flow the source creek river stream has and the velocity of the flow of water Energy can be stored in battery banks at sites that are far from a facility or used in addition to a system that is directly connected so that in times of high demand there is additional reserve energy available These systems can be designed to minimize community and environmental impact regularly caused by large dams or other mass hydroelectric generation sites Potential for rural development edit In relation to rural development the simplicity and low relative cost of micro hydro systems open up new opportunities for some isolated communities in need of electricity With only a small stream needed remote areas can access lighting and communications for homes medical clinics schools and other facilities Microhydro can even run a certain level of machinery supporting small businesses Regions along the Andes mountains and in Sri Lanka and China already have similar active programs One seemingly unexpected use of such systems in some areas is to keep young community members from moving into more urban regions in order to spur economic growth Also as the possibility of financial incentives for less carbon-intensive processes grows the future of microhydro systems may become more appealing Micro-hydro installations can also provide multiple uses For instance micro-hydro projects in rural Asia have incorporated agro-processing facilities such as rice mills alongside standard electrification into the project design Cost edit The cost of a micro hydro plant can be between and U S dollars per kW installed citation needed Advantages and disadvantages edit Advantages edit Microhydro power is generated through a process that utilizes the natural flow of water This power is most commonly converted into electricity With no direct emissions resulting from this conversion process there are little to no harmful effects on the environment if planned well thus supplying power from a renewable source and in a sustainable manner Microhydro is considered a run-of-river system meaning that water diverted from the stream or river is redirected back into the same watercourse Adding to the potential economic benefits of microhydro is efficiency reliability and cost effectiveness Disadvantages edit Microhydro systems are limited mainly by the characteristics of the site The most direct limitation comes from small sources with the minuscule flow Likewise flow can fluctuate seasonally in some areas Lastly though perhaps the foremost disadvantage is the distance from the power source to the site in need of energy This distributional issue as well as the others are key when considering using a micro-hydro system See also edit Renewable energy portal Energy portal Water portal Small hydro up to kW Pico hydro up to kW Hydro power Renewable Energy Sustainable

    "content": "Pico hydro - Wikipedia Jump to content From Wikipedia the free encyclopedia Hydroelectric power generation under kW A pico hydro system made by the Sustainable Vision project from Baylor University Pico hydro is a term used for hydroelectric power generation of under kW These generators have proven to be useful in small remote communities that require only a small amount of electricity for example to power one or two fluorescent light bulbs and a TV or radio in or so homes Even smaller turbines of W may power a single home with a drop of only metre ft Pico-hydro setups typically are run-of-stream meaning that a reservoir of water is not created only a small weir is common pipes divert some of the flow drop this down a gradient and through the turbine before being exhausted back to the stream Like other hydroelectric and renewable source power generation pollution and consumption of fossil fuels is reduced though there is still typically an environmental cost to the manufacture of the generator and distribution methods Small-scale DIY hydroplants edit With a growing DIY -community and an increasing interest in environmentally friendly green energy some hobbyists have endeavored to build their own hydroelectric plants from old water mills from kits or from scratch The DIY-community has used abandoned water mills to mount a waterwheel and electrical generating components This approach has also been popularized in the TV-series It s Not Easy Being Green These are usually smaller turbines of kW or less Through the internet the community is now able to obtain plans to construct DIY-water turbines and there is a growing trend toward building them for domestic requirements The DIY-hydroelectric plants are now being used both in developed countries and in developing countries to power residences and small businesses Two examples of pico hydro power can be found in the towns of Kithamba and Thimba in the Central Province of Kenya These produce kW and kW respectively Local residents were trained to maintain the hydro schemes The pico hydro sites in Kenya won Ashden Awards for Sustainable Energy Using a pumped-storage system of cisterns and small generators pico hydro may also be effective for closed loop home systems Manufacturers edit In Vietnam several Chinese manufacturers have sold pico-powerplants at prices as low as for a powerplant of W However the devices sold are said to be low in quality and may damage connected equipment if connected improperly Sam Redfield of the Appropriate Infrastructure Development Group AIDG has developed a pico-hydro generator made from common PVC pipe and a modified Toyota alternator housed in a five gallon bucket The generator was developed to provide power to communities without access to the electricity grid in developing countries Envisioned as an energy source to charge cell phones provide lighting and charge batteries the generator is designed to be made by artisans with basic skills and can be built for less than The Toyota alternator used in the generator is converted to a permanent magnet alternator allowing it to generate power at low RPMs The Five Gallon Bucket Hydroelectric Generator was the subject of a work group at the International Development Design Summit IDDS at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology During the Summer of an energy project in Abra Malaga Peru was completed using the bucket generator A website has been put together as a forum for ideas and further iterations of the generator that includes a build manual Common centrifugal water pumps can be operated in reverse to act as turbines While these machines rarely have optimum hydraulic characteristics when operated as turbines their availability and low cost makes them attractive Transmission distance edit If the power will be used more than metres ft from the generator then the transmission distance may be an important consideration Many small systems use automotive alternators producing VDC and possibly charging a battery For example a V system that produces kW of power has a flow of A and the wire size is -gauge The purchase cost of two strands of wire metres ft long for this voltage and amperage was typically US in To avoid such a large wire cost a higher voltage and lower current is required If a VAC alternator is used instead the flow is only A over metres ft of gauge wire costing US The cost of wire resulted in North America using VAC after DC voltage lost the war of the currents in the late s Another approach to reduce wire costs is to have a VDC alternator with a short high current connection to an inverter outputting VAC or VAC at a much lower current on a long length of thinner wire See also edit Energy portal Small hydro to MW Micro

es-Atlantiques France Small hydro is the generation of hydroelectric power on a smaller scale as compared to traditional large-scale hydro Exact definitions vary by country but small hydro power SHP projects are typically less than megawatts MW and can be further subdivided by scale into mini kW micro kW and pico kW Maximum power generation capacity is the primary factor of SHP classification Factors like dam height weir height reservoir area outlet structures and operating procedures are not standardized under this metric SHP projects have grown rapidly in the past two decades Quicker permitting processes can make them easier to develop and contribute to distributed generation in a regional electricity grid Small hydro projects may be built in isolated areas that would be uneconomic to serve from a national electricity grid or in areas where a national grid does not exist They produce power on a scale suitable for local community use promoting energy independence Rural areas face challenges in SHP integration due to an absence of political focus accurate data and sustainable funding The exact socio-environmental effects of smaller scale hydro are not yet fully understood Many countries do not require environmental impact assessments for smaller installations Description edit The use of the term small hydro varies considerably around the world In India hydro projects with up to MW capacities are categorized as Small Hydro Power SHP projects In California hydroelectric generating stations with a maximum capacity of less than MW are classified as small and are eligible for inclusion in the state s renewable portfolio standard The maximum limit is usually somewhere between and MW and is stretched up to MW in Canada China Pakistan and the United States The reservoir of the Iron Gate Dam an MW capacity facility deconstructed in A variety of project designs can be implemented for hydro projects with similar energy capacities Some SHP projects utilize a run-of-river system Others such as the Iron Gate Dam utilize impoundment systems which host the disadvantages associated with reservoirs For investors environmentalists and policy makers small hydro projects are considered most viable when there is little ecological impact and projected profit after construction Advantages and disadvantages edit The primary advantages of small hydro development include low costs to build and the ability to remain disconnected from centralized power grids Contentious points within small hydropower development include issues in environmental justice regulatory oversight and environmental impacts In a number of communities which lack essential electricity access small hydro offers a reliable source of decentralized electricity Small hydro projects do not always require significant government assistance and gaps in governance allow them to be built fairly easily Given these policy gaps small hydropower as a renewable climate mitigation strategy can also negatively affect local livelihoods in the absence of community-minded policy The environmental impacts of small hydropower projects are understudied Within run-of-river design projects the greatest harm for water systems are flow regime alteration loss of river cohesion and connectivity and habitat degradation effecting fish and macroinvertebrates An example of a small hydro power plant Sveta Petka Growth edit Between and China planned to electrify a further villages under their China Village Electrification Program including further investments in small hydro and photovoltaics By China had small hydro installations especially in rural areas producing Twh annually Over of the world s potential small hydro power was found in Asia however a report noted that It is possible in the future that more small hydropower potential might be identified both on the African and American continents In the mountains and rain forests of British Columbia Canada there are a great many sites suitable for hydro development However environmental concerns towards large reservoirs after the s halted new dam construction The solution to coping with increased demand was to offer contracts to independent power producers who have built run of the river projects under MW Power production without reservoirs varies dramatically but older conventional dams retain or release water to average out production though the year In these independent producers generated GWh from MW of capacity As of the global capacity for projects MW is approximately GW with China holding over of the world s SHP installed capacity Under this definition MW installed SHP capacity increased by in the Americas from to Because of local differences in SHP definitions it is likely that the installed capacity of SHPs across the globe is higher than these totals Countries such as China India and Brazil are significantly expanding their small hydro capacity in the st century The continents of Asia Africa and the Americas hold the most potential for small hydro power growth An hydroelectric plant near Telluride Colorado History edit Wood water wheels along riversides may be considered the first examples of small hydro Up to the th century the efficiency of water wheels neared However as the need for power generation increased small hydropower projects were phased out in favor of the large scale dams using newly designed turbines Post th century environmental doctrine is moving away from large-scale hydropower construction due to increased awareness of ecological problems associated with dams Examples of previous dam deconstruction projects include the Restoration of the Elwha River and Un-Dam the Klamath river movement in the United States Both of these projects deconstructed dams with generation capacities less than MW Generation edit Main article hydroelectricity Historic Ottenbach Small Hydro with original equipment of in Ottenbach Switzerland still running for guided visits Hongping Power station in Hongping Town Shennongjia has a design typical for small hydro stations in the western part of China s Hubei Province Water comes from the mountain behind the station through the black pipe seen in the photo Hydroelectric power is the generation of electric power from the movement of water A hydroelectric facility requires a dependable flow of water and a reasonable height for the water to fall called the head In a typical installation water is fed from a reservoir through a pipe into a turbine The water flowing through the turbine causes an electrical generator to rotate converting the motion into electrical energy Small hydro projects may be created from the re-development of existing dams whose primary purpose is flood control or irrigation Old hydro sites may also be re-developed with water rights re-used salvaging substantial investment in installation technology such as penstock pipe and turbines Either of these cost saving advantages can make the return on investment for a small hydro site well worth the use of existing sites Brazil is another country which is investing heavily in small hydro Brazil itself is a leader in hydroelectric generation the world s third most hydropower installed capacity country at GW behind the United States at GW and China in first place with GW new small hydro projects are as of being constructed in Brazil Project Design edit Many companies offer standardized turbine generator packages in the approximate size range of kW to MW These water to wire packages simplify the planning and development of the site since one vendor looks after most of the equipment supply Because non-recurring engineering costs are minimized and development cost is spread over multiple units the cost of such package systems is reduced While synchronous generators capable of isolated plant operation are often used small hydro plants connected to an electrical grid system can use economical induction generators to further reduce installation cost and simplify control and operation Small run of the river projects do not have a conventional dam with a reservoir only a weir to form a headpond for diversion of inlet water to the turbine Unused water simply flows over the weir and the headpond may only be capable of a single day s storage not enough for dry summers or frozen winters when generation may come to a halt A preferred scenario is to have the inlet in an existing lake Modular micro hydrokinetic systems have been developed for irrigation canals Irrigation districts across the U S have installed power plants at diversion points and in-canal drops which are traditionally used for flow measurement to stabilize upstream heads and to dissipate energy where there is significant elevation change throughout the canal system Countries like India and China have policies in favor of small hydro and the regulatory process allows for building dams and reservoirs In North America and Europe the regulatory process is too long and expensive to consider having a dam and a reservoir for a small project Small hydro projects usually have faster environmental and licensing procedures and since the equipment is usually in serial production standardized and simplified and the civil works construction is also reduced the projects may be developed very rapidly The physically smaller size of equipment makes it easier to transport to remote areas without good road or rail access One measure of decreased environmental impact with lakes and reservoirs depends on the balance between stream flow and power production Reducing water diversions helps the river s ecosystem but reduces the hydro system s return on Investment ROI The hydro system design must strike a balance to maintain both the health of the stream and the economics Part of the balance between a small hydro project s return on investment and environmental concern is the proximity of the project to the national power grid The more isolated a small hydro project is the more cost effective its construction will be Policy and Regulation edit Government support of small hydro differs by country To support renewable energy policy in Japan the government promotes the development of community-based SHP projects with high feed-in tariffs and low interest rates for loans In Bosnia and Herzegovina s parliament banned small hydro projects up to MWh in energy generation capacity citing environmental harm Lack of consistency in small hydropower definitions and lack of research of socio-environmental impacts has created variance surrounding policy-making and licensing decisions Around two-thirds of countries do not require a formal environmental licensing process to construct and operate small hydropower projects In India SHPs under MW do not require an Environmental Impact Assessment and instead have a Detailed Project Report DPR These reports provide basic information to policy and decision makers speeding up timelines for small hydro developments Planning and approval processes under India s DPRs do not require community engagement nor consultation Energy Justice edit Many small hydro developments are made in rural or geographically isolated areas where it is expensive to connect to national power grids For instance rural areas in India or other countries that have flowing water regimes utilize small hydro to provide a renewable source of energy without connection to the national grid Environmental justice of small hydro development has been most discussed in Asia and the Americas Asia edit In mountainous regions such as in the Indian state of Himachal Pradesh small tributaries play an essential role in the water supply of villages irrigating agriculture and supplying water to households The diversion of these streams for small hydropower generation threatens water quality irrigation supply and local livelihoods Local residents of Himachal Pradesh assert that benefits of local SHP projects have been exaggerated and have pushed for legal opposition to their development In Matsuguma Village Japan a kW small hydropower plant was completed in under a private-public partnership The local government approached the community explaining their goal to supply power to the regional electric grid Community members collaborated with a business model based by the local community and for the local community By selling the electricity produced community members obtained energy democracy improved the infrastructure of the village and improved their welfare and quality of life South America edit Because SHP projects under MW are considered renewable in Chile they are oftentimes approved without indigenous consultation ignoring community demands for autonomy and self-determination The Ralco Dam controversy in Chile afforded indigenous Chilean communities a governmental promise of no more mega-projects on the upper BioB o river the second largest river in Chile Lack of political and environmental oversight has allowed for multiple small hydropower installations to be developed in this area contributing to further tensions in the Mapuche Conflict Environmental Impacts edit Environmental effects of small hydro projects are understudied impacts are dependent upon individual project design Changes in the hydrologic cycles of an area can result in loss of river cohesion and connectivity contributing to habitat degradation and loss of biodiversity for fish and macroinvertebrates Small dams and ensuing water diversion may hinder the movement of fish as well and contribute to methane emissions from decomposed biomass Multiple small hydropower projects are occasionally placed segmentally on rivers but little research has been done on the effects of multiple installations in a collective area In India cumulative effects of multiple SHP projects are not considered prior to granting hydropower developments In China researchers found the effects of river connectivity on a river with small hydro projects to significantly outweigh the impacts associated with a river containing larger-scale projects Previous studies on the sustainability of hydropower focus on greenhouse gas emission estimations which are generally lesser than other conventional or renewable energy systems Assessments of sustainability often do not consider additional parameters such as environmental impacts land use social costs and cultural effects With climate change threatening the reliability of seasonal river flows the efficiency and sustainability of small hydro for energy generation is unknown Sample list of small installations worldwide edit Africa Zengamina a kW plant in Kalene Hill Mwinilunga District in northwestern Zambia Asia Meenvallam Small Hydroelectric Project Palakkad

    "content": "Marine current power - Wikipedia Jump to content From Wikipedia the free encyclopedia Extraction of power from ocean currents Marine currents can carry large amounts of water largely driven by the tides which are a consequence of the gravitational effects of the planetary motion of the Earth the Moon and the Sun Augmented flow velocities can be found where the underwater topography in straits between islands and the mainland or in shallows around headlands plays a major role in enhancing the flow velocities resulting in appreciable kinetic energy The Sun acts as the primary driving force causing winds and temperature differences Because there are only small fluctuations in current speed and stream location with minimal changes in direction ocean currents may be suitable locations for deploying energy extraction devices such as turbines Other effects such as regional differences in temperature and salinity and the Coriolis effect due to the rotation of the earth are also major influences The kinetic energy of marine currents can be converted in much the same way that a wind turbine extracts energy from the wind using various types of open-flow rotors Energy potential edit Vector Diagram of current flow along the east coast of the United States The total worldwide power in ocean currents has been estimated to be about GW with power densities of up to kW m The relatively constant extractable energy density near the surface of the Florida Straits Current is about kW m of flow area It has been estimated that capturing just th of the available energy from the Gulf Stream which has times more energy than Niagara Falls in a flow of water that is times the total flow of all the world s freshwater rivers would supply Florida with of its electrical needs The image to the right illustrates the high density of flow along the coast note the high velocity white northward flow perfect for extraction of ocean current energy Countries that are interested in and pursuing the application of ocean current energy technologies include the European Union Japan the United States and China The potential of electric power generation from marine tidal currents is enormous There are several factors that make electricity generation from marine currents very appealing when compared to other renewables The high load factors resulting from the fluid properties The predictability of the resource so that unlike most of other renewables the future availability of energy can be known and planned for The potentially large resource that can be exploited with little environmental impact thereby offering one of the least damaging methods for large-scale electricity generation The feasibility of marine-current power installations to provide also base grid power especially if two or more separate arrays with offset peak-flow periods are interconnected Technologies for marine-current-power generation edit Illustration of windpower-inspired axial-flow turbine used for marine power generation There are several types of open-flow devices that can be used in marine-current-power applications many of them are modern descendants of the water wheel or similar However the more technically sophisticated designs derived from wind-power rotors are the most likely to achieve enough cost-effectiveness and reliability to be practical in a massive marine-current-power future scenario Even though there is no generally accepted term for these open-flow hydro turbines some sources refer to them as water-current turbines There are three main types of water current turbines that might be considered axial-flow horizontal-axis propellers with both variable-pitch or fixed-pitch underwater kites and cross-flow Darrieus rotors The rotor types may be combined with any of the three main methods for supporting water-current turbines floating moored systems sea-bed mounted systems and intermediate systems Sea-bed-mounted monopile structures constitute the first-generation marine current power systems They have the advantage of using existing and reliable engineering know-how but they are limited to relatively shallow waters about to meters to feet depth History and application edit The possible use of marine currents as an energy resource began to draw attention in the mid- s after the first oil crisis In several conceptual designs were presented at the MacArthur Workshop on Energy and in the British General Electric Co undertook a partially government-funded study which concluded that marine current power deserved more detailed research Soon after the ITD-Group in UK implemented a research program involving a year of performance testing of a -m hydroDarrieus rotor deployed at Juba on the White Nile citation needed The s saw a number of small research projects to evaluate marine current power systems The main countries where studies were carried out were the UK Canada and Japan In the Tidal Stream Energy Review identified specific sites in UK waters with suitable current speed to generate up to TWh year It confirmed a total marine current power resource capable theoretically of meeting some of the UK electricity demand citation needed In the EU-JOULE CENEX project identified over European sites ranging from to km of sea-bed area many with power densities above MW km Both the UK Government and the EU have committed themselves to internationally negotiated agreements designed to combat global warming In order to comply with such agreements an increase in large-scale electricity generation from renewable resources will be required Marine currents have the potential to supply a substantial share of future EU electricity needs The study of possible sites for tidal turbines in the EU showed a total potential for power generation of about TWh year If this resource is to be successfully utilized the technology required could form the basis of a major new industry to produce clean power for the st century Contemporary applications of these technologies can be found here List of tidal power stations Since the effects of tides on ocean currents are so large and their flow patterns are quite reliable many ocean current energy extraction plants are placed in areas of high tidal flow rates Research on marine current power is conducted at among others Uppsala University in Sweden where a test unit with a straight-bladed Darrieus type turbine has been constructed and placed in the Dal river in Sweden Environmental effects edit Ocean currents are instrumental in determining the climate in many regions around the world While little is known about the effects of removing ocean current energy the impacts of removing current energy on the farfield environment may be a significant environmental concern The typical turbine issues with blade strike entanglement of marine organisms and acoustic effects still exists however these may be magnified due to the presence of more diverse populations of marine organisms using ocean currents for migration purposes Locations can be further offshore and therefore require longer power cables that could affect the marine

Renewable energy portal v t e Marine energy also known as ocean energy ocean power or marine and hydrokinetic energy refers to energy harnessed from waves tides salinity gradients and temperature differences in the ocean The movement of water in the world s oceans stores vast amounts of kinetic energy which can be converted into electricity to power homes transportation and industries Marine energy includes wave power which is derived from surface waves and tidal power which is obtained from the kinetic energy of moving water Offshore wind power however is not considered marine energy because it is generated from wind even if the wind turbines are located over water The oceans have a tremendous amount of energy and are close to many if not most concentrated populations Ocean energy has the potential of providing a substantial amount of new renewable energy around the world While marine energy is a sustainable alternative to fossil fuels its development can impact marine ecosystems wildlife and the physical environment Potential effects include habitat disruption noise pollution and electromagnetic fields from subsea cables which may require mitigation strategies such as fish-friendly turbine designs and environmental impact assessments Government policies economic incentives and regulatory frameworks contribute significantly to advancing marine energy with countries like the UK Canada and South Korea leading in tidal and wave energy projects Global potential edit The global potential for marine energy is significant with estimates suggesting that to

waters Marine current power edit Main article Marine current power Strong ocean currents are driven by temperature wind salinity bathymetry and the rotation of the Earth The Sun acts as the primary driving force causing winds and temperature differences Because there are only small fluctuations in current speed and stream location with no changes in direction ocean currents may be suitable locations for deploying energy extraction devices such as turbines Ocean currents are instrumental in determining the climate in many regions around the world While little is known about the effects

Locations can be further offshore and therefore require longer power cables that could affect the marine environment with electromagnetic output Osmotic power edit Main article Osmotic power At the mouth of rivers where fresh water mixes with salt water energy associated with the salinity gradient can be harnessed using pressure-retarded reverse osmosis process and associated conversion technologies Another system is based on using freshwater upwelling through a turbine immersed in seawater and one involving electrochemical reactions is also in development Significant research took place from to and gave various results regarding the economy of PRO and RED plants Small-scale investigations into salinity power production take place in other countries like Japan Israel and the United States In Europe the research is concentrated in Norway and the Netherlands in both places small pilots are tested Salinity gradient energy is the energy available from the difference in salt concentration between freshwater with saltwater This energy source is not easy to understand as it is not directly occurring in nature in the form of heat waterfalls wind waves or radiation Ocean thermal energy edit Main article Ocean thermal energy conversion Water typically varies in temperature from the surface warmed by direct sunlight to greater depths where sunlight cannot penetrate This differential is greatest in tropical waters making this technology most applicable in water locations A fluid is often vaporized to drive a turbine that may generate electricity or produce desalinized water Systems may be either open-cycle closed-cycle or hybrid Tidal power edit Main article Tidal power The energy from moving masses of water a popular form of hydroelectric power generation Tidal power generation comprises three main forms namely tidal stream power tidal barrage power and dynamic tidal power Wave power edit Main article Wave power Solar energy from the Sun creates temperature differentials that result in wind The interaction between wind and the surface of water creates waves which are larger when there is a greater distance for them to build up Wave energy potential is greatest between and latitude in both hemispheres on the west coast because of the global direction of wind When evaluating wave energy as a technology type it is important to distinguish between the four most common approaches point absorber buoys surface attenuators oscillating water columns and overtopping devices The wave energy sector is reaching a significant milestone in the development of the industry with positive steps towards commercial viability being taken The more advanced device developers are now progressing beyond single unit demonstration devices and are proceeding to array development and multi-megawatt projects The backing of major utility companies is now manifesting itself through partnerships within the development process unlocking further investment and in some cases international co-operation At a simplified level wave energy technology can be located near-shore and offshore Wave energy converters can also be designed for operation in specific water depth conditions deep water intermediate water or shallow water The fundamental device design will be dependent on the location of the device and the intended resource characteristics Environmental effects edit Marine energy harnessed from renewable sources such as waves tides and ocean currents is widely regarded as a sustainable alternative to fossil fuels However similar to other energy technologies marine energy may have environmental impacts that need to be carefully assessed These effects can be broadly categorized into impacts on marine ecosystems wildlife and the physical environment Impacts on Marine Ecosystems The deployment of marine energy infrastructure can alter local ecosystems by modifying water flow sediment transport and habitat structures For instance tidal barrages which block the natural flow of water can lead to changes in salinity levels and sediment deposition in estuaries Such alterations can disrupt benthic habitats affecting species that rely on these environments for survival Research has shown that tidal energy projects can result in localized habitat loss particularly for species sensitive to changes in sediment composition and water flow Wave energy converters WECs can also influence marine ecosystems While they may create artificial reefs that attract certain species they can simultaneously displace others leading to competition for resources In some cases these structures have been observed to enhance biodiversity but the overall impact depends on the specific design and location of the devices The ecological trade-offs associated with WECs highlight the importance of careful planning and monitoring to balance energy production with environmental conservation Effects on Marine Wildlife Marine energy technologies pose risks to marine wildlife particularly through collisions with underwater turbines noise pollution and electromagnetic fields EMFs generated by subsea cables For example tidal turbines which operate in high-flow environments can pose a threat to fish and marine mammals that may collide with rotating blades While the risk of collision is generally considered low it can be significant for slow-moving or migratory species necessitating the development of fish-friendly turbine designs Noise pollution is another concern associated with marine energy installations The construction and operation of devices can generate underwater noise which may disrupt marine life Cetaceans such as whales and dolphins rely heavily on sound for communication navigation and foraging Prolonged exposure to noise can lead to behavioral changes increased stress levels and even habitat abandonment Mitigation measures such as noise-reduction technologies and strategic placement of devices are required to minimize these impacts Electromagnetic fields EMFs from subsea power cables can also affect marine species particularly those sensitive to electromagnetic stimuli such as sharks and rays citation needed Physical and Chemical Changes The installation of marine energy infrastructure can lead to physical changes in the marine environment such as altered wave patterns and coastal erosion For example large-scale wave energy farms can reduce the amount of wave energy reaching the shore which may impact coastal processes like sediment transport In some cases this could exacerbate coastal erosion particularly in areas already vulnerable to such changes Chemical impacts such as the release of antifouling agents or other pollutants from marine energy devices are another potential concern While these impacts are generally minor compared to those associated with fossil fuel extraction they still require careful management to minimize harm to marine ecosystems Regular maintenance and the use of environmentally friendly materials can help mitigate these risks Mitigation and Best Practices Governments and organizations have developed regulatory frameworks and best practices to address these environmental effects Regulatory bodies typically require environmental impact assessments EIAs before deploying marine energy projects These assessments help identify potential risks and guide mitigation strategies such as the use of fish-friendly turbine designs noise-reduction technologies and strategic placement of devices to minimize ecological disruption International organizations such as the International Renewable Energy Agency IRENA have published guidelines for sustainable marine energy development These guidelines emphasize the importance of stakeholder engagement adaptive management and long-term monitoring to ensure that marine energy projects are environmentally responsible By adhering to these principles the marine energy industry can balance the need for renewable energy with the protection of marine ecosystems and wildlife Policies Economics and Government Initiatives edit The development of marine energy is heavily influenced by government policies economic incentives and regulatory frameworks These factors play a critical role in fostering innovation attracting investment and ensuring the sustainable deployment of marine energy technologies Economic Considerations Marine energy is still in the early stages of commercialization and its economic viability depends on reducing costs and improving efficiency The high capital expenditure CapEx and operational expenditure OpEx associated with marine energy projects have historically been barriers to widespread adoption However technological advancements economies of scale and government support are helping to drive down costs For example the levelized cost of energy LCOE for tidal and wave energy has decreased significantly in recent years though it remains higher than that of more established renewable energy sources like wind and solar Government subsidies grants and tax incentives are often used to offset the high initial costs of marine energy projects These financial mechanisms are designed to encourage private sector investment and accelerate the deployment of marine energy technologies Government Policies and Regulatory Frameworks Government policies significantly influence the development of marine energy Many countries have implemented renewable energy targets feed-in tariffs and renewable portfolio standards RPS to promote the development of marine energy For instance the European Union has set ambitious renewable energy targets as part of its Green Deal with marine energy identified as a key component of its strategy to achieve carbon neutrality by In the United Kingdom the Marine Energy Programme has been instrumental in supporting the development of tidal and wave energy The program provides funding for research and development R D as well as demonstration projects The UK government has also established the Contracts for Difference CfD scheme which guarantees a fixed price for electricity generated from marine energy providing long-term revenue certainty for developers United States has implemented policies to support marine energy through the Department of Energy s Water Power Technologies Office WPTO The WPTO funds R D initiatives and provides grants for pilot projects The Marine Renewable Energy Act has also been proposed to create a regulatory framework for the development of marine energy resources in U S waters Case Studies United Kingdom The UK is a global leader in marine energy particularly tidal energy The MeyGen tidal energy project in Scotland is one of the largest tidal stream projects in the world Supported by government funding and private investment the project has demonstrated the potential for large-scale tidal energy generation The UK s supportive policy environment including the CfD scheme has played a key role in the project s success Canada Canada has significant marine energy resources particularly in the Bay of Fundy which has some of the highest tidal ranges in the world The Fundy Ocean Research Center for Energy FORCE in Nova Scotia serves as a test site for tidal energy technologies The Canadian government has provided funding for FORCE and established regulatory frameworks to facilitate the deployment of marine energy projects South Korea South Korea has made substantial investments in marine energy as part of its renewable energy strategy The Sihwa Lake

    "content": "Ocean thermal energy conversion - Wikipedia Jump to content From Wikipedia the free encyclopedia Extracting energy from the ocean Ocean thermal energy conversion OTEC is a renewable energy technology that harnesses the temperature difference between the warm surface waters of the ocean and the cold depths to run a heat engine to produce electricity It is a unique form of clean energy generation that has the potential to provide a consistent and sustainable source of power Although it has challenges to overcome OTEC has the potential to provide a consistent and sustainable source of clean energy particularly in tropical regions with access to deep ocean water Description edit OTEC uses the ocean thermal gradient between cooler deep and warmer shallow or surface seawaters to run a heat engine and produce useful work usually in the form of electricity OTEC can operate with a very high capacity factor and so can operate in base load mode The denser cold water masses formed by ocean surface water interaction with cold atmosphere in quite specific areas of the North Atlantic and the Southern Ocean sink into the deep sea basins and spread in entire deep ocean by the thermohaline circulation Upwelling of cold water from the deep ocean is replenished by the downwelling of cold surface sea water Among ocean energy sources OTEC is one of the continuously available renewable energy resources that could contribute to base-load power supply The resource potential for OTEC is considered to be much larger than for other ocean energy forms Up to TWh yr of power could be generated from OTEC without affecting the ocean s thermal structure Systems may be either closed-cycle or open-cycle Closed-cycle OTEC uses working fluids that are typically thought of as refrigerants such as ammonia or R- a These fluids have low boiling points and are therefore suitable for powering the system s generator to generate electricity The most commonly used heat cycle for OTEC to date is the Rankine cycle using a low-pressure turbine Open-cycle engines use vapor from the seawater itself as the working fluid OTEC can also supply quantities of cold water as a by-product This can be used for air conditioning and refrigeration and the nutrient-rich deep ocean water can feed biological technologies Another by-product is fresh water distilled from the sea OTEC theory was first developed in the s and the first bench size demonstration model was constructed in Currently operating pilot-scale OTEC plants are located in Japan overseen by Saga University and in Hawaii operated by Makai Ocean Engineering History edit French engineer Georges Claude conducting a demonstration on ocean thermal energy conversion at the Institut de France in Attempts to develop and refine OTEC technology started in the s In Jacques Arsene d Arsonval a French physicist proposed tapping the thermal energy of the ocean D Arsonval s student Georges Claude built the first OTEC plant in Matanzas Cuba in The system generated kW of electricity with a low- pressure turbine The plant was later destroyed in a storm In Claude constructed a plant aboard a - ton cargo vessel moored off the coast of Brazil Weather and waves destroyed it before it could generate net power Net power is the amount of power generated after subtracting power needed to run the system In French scientists designed a MW plant for Abidjan Ivory Coast The plant was never completed because new finds of large amounts of cheap petroleum made it uneconomical In J Hilbert Anderson and James H Anderson Jr focused on increasing component efficiency They patented their new closed cycle design in This design improved upon the original closed-cycle Rankine system and included this in an outline for a plant that would produce power at lower cost than oil or coal At the time however their research garnered little attention since coal and nuclear were considered the future of energy Japan is a major contributor to the development of OTEC technology Beginning in the Tokyo Electric Power Company successfully built and deployed a kW closed-cycle OTEC plant on the island of Nauru The plant became operational on October producing about kW of electricity kW was used to power the plant and the remaining electricity was used to power a school and other places This set a world record for power output from an OTEC system where the power was sent to a real as opposed to an experimental power grid also saw a major development in OTEC technology when Russian engineer Dr Alexander Kalina used a mixture of ammonia and water to produce electricity This new ammonia-water mixture greatly improved the efficiency of the power cycle In the Institute of Ocean Energy at Saga University designed and constructed a kW plant for the purpose of testing a newly invented Uehara cycle also named after its inventor Haruo Uehara This cycle included absorption and extraction processes that allow this system to outperform the Kalina cycle by The s saw an uptick in OTEC research and development during the post Arab-Israeli War which caused oil prices to triple The U S federal government poured million into OTEC research after President Carter signed a law that committed the US to a production goal of MW of electricity from OTEC systems by View of a land based OTEC facility at Keahole Point on the Kona coast of Hawaii In The U S established the Natural Energy Laboratory of Hawaii Authority NELHA at Keahole Point on the Kona coast of Hawaii Hawaii is the best US OTEC location due to its warm surface water access to very deep very cold water and high electricity costs The laboratory has become a leading test facility for OTEC technology In the same year Lockheed received a grant from the U S National Science Foundation to study OTEC This eventually led to an effort by Lockheed the US Navy Makai Ocean Engineering Dillingham Construction and other firms to build the world s first and only net-power producing OTEC plant dubbed Mini-OTEC For three months in a small amount of electricity was generated NELHA operated a kW demonstration plant for six years in the s With funding from the United States Navy a kW plant at the site began supplying energy to the local power grid in A European initiative EUROCEAN - a privately funded joint venture of European companies already active in offshore engineering - was active in promoting OTEC from to Initially a large scale offshore facility was studied Later a kW land based installation was studied combining land based OTEC with Desalination and Aquaculture nicknamed ODA This was based on the results from a small scale aquaculture facility at the island of St Croix that used a deepwater supply line to feed the aquaculture basins Also a shore based open cycle plant was investigated The location of the case of study was the Dutch Kingdom related island Cura ao Research related to making open-cycle OTEC a reality began earnestly in at the Solar Energy Research Institute SERI with funding from the US Department of Energy Evaporators and suitably configured direct-contact condensers were developed and patented by SERI see An original design for a power-producing experiment then called the -kW experiment was described by Kreith and Bharathan and as the Max Jakob Memorial Award Lecture The initial design used two parallel axial turbines using last stage rotors taken from large steam turbines Later a team led by Dr Bharathan at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory NREL developed the initial conceptual design for up-dated kW open-cycle OTEC experiment This design integrated all components of the cycle namely the evaporator condenser and the turbine into one single vacuum vessel with the turbine mounted on top to prevent any potential for water to reach it The vessel was made of concrete as the first process vacuum vessel of its kind Attempts to make all components using low-cost plastic material could not be fully achieved as some conservatism was required for the turbine and the vacuum pumps developed as the first of their kind Later Dr Bharathan worked with a team of engineers at the Pacific Institute for High Technology Research PICHTR to further pursue this design through preliminary and final stages It was renamed the Net Power Producing Experiment NPPE and was constructed at the Natural Energy Laboratory of Hawaii NELH by PICHTR by a team led by Chief Engineer Don Evans and the project was managed by Dr Luis Vega India pipes used for OTEC left and floating OTEC plant constructed in right In India tested a MW floating OTEC pilot plant near Tamil Nadu The plant was ultimately unsuccessful due to a failure of the deep sea cold water pipe Its government continues to sponsor research In Makai Ocean Engineering was awarded a contract from the U S Office of Naval Research ONR to investigate the potential for OTEC to produce nationally significant quantities of hydrogen in at-sea floating plants located in warm tropical waters Realizing the need for larger partners to actually commercialize OTEC Makai approached Lockheed Martin to renew their previous relationship and determine if the time was ready for OTEC And so in Lockheed Martin resumed work in OTEC and became a subcontractor to Makai to support their SBIR which was followed by other subsequent collaborations In March Ocean Thermal Energy Corporation signed an Energy Services Agreement ESA with the Baha Mar resort Nassau Bahamas for the world s first and largest seawater air conditioning SWAC system In June the project was put on pause while the resort resolved financial and ownership issues In August it was announced that the issues had been resolved and that the resort would open in March It is expected that the SWAC system s construction will resume at that time Makai Ocean Engineering s kW OTEC Plant in Kona HI In July Makai Ocean Engineering completed the design and construction of an OTEC Heat Exchanger Test Facility at the Natural Energy Laboratory of Hawaii The purpose of the facility is to arrive at an optimal design for OTEC heat exchangers increasing performance and useful life while reducing cost heat exchangers being the cost driver for an OTEC plant And in March Makai announced an award to install and operate a kilowatt turbine on the OTEC Heat Exchanger Test Facility this marked the first time that OTEC power was connected to the U S grid In July the Virgin Islands Public Services Commission approved Ocean Thermal Energy Corporation s application to become a Qualified Facility The company is thus permitted to begin negotiations with the Virgin Islands Water and Power Authority WAPA for a Power Purchase Agreement PPA pertaining to an Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion OTEC plant on the island of St Croix This would be the world s first commercial OTEC plant A project is set to be installed in the African country of S o Tom and Pr ncipe which will be the first commercial-scale floating OTEC platform in the world Developed by Global OTEC the structure named Dominique will generate MW with subsequent barges being installed to help supply the full demand of the country In an MoU was signed between the government and British startup Global OTEC Currently operating OTEC plants edit In March Saga University with various Japanese industries completed the installation of a new OTEC plant Okinawa Prefecture announced the start of the OTEC operation testing at Kume Island on April The main aim is to prove the validity of computer models and demonstrate OTEC to the public The testing and research will be conducted with the support of Saga University until the end of FY IHI Plant Construction Co Ltd Yokogawa Electric Corporation and Xenesys Inc were entrusted with constructing the kilowatt class plant within the grounds of the Okinawa Prefecture Deep Sea Water Research Center The location was specifically chosen in order to utilize existing deep seawater and surface seawater intake pipes installed for the research center in The pipe is used for the intake of deep sea water for research fishery and agricultural use The plant consists of two kW units in double Rankine configuration The OTEC facility and deep seawater research center are open to free public tours by appointment in English and Japanese Currently this is one of only two fully operational OTEC plants in the world This plant operates continuously when specific tests are not underway In Makai Ocean Engineering completed a heat exchanger test facility at NELHA Used to test a variety of heat exchange technologies for use in OTEC Makai has received funding to install a kW turbine Installation will make this facility the largest operational OTEC facility though the record for largest power will remain with the Open Cycle plant also developed in Hawaii In July DCNS group partnered with Akuo Energy announced NER funding for their NEMO project If the project was successful the MW gross MW net offshore plant would have been the largest OTEC facility to date DCNS planned to have NEMO operational by failed verification Early in April Naval Energies shut down the project indefinitely due to technical difficulties relating to the main cold-water intake pipe An ocean thermal energy conversion power plant built by Makai Ocean Engineering went operational in Hawaii in August The governor of Hawaii David Ige flipped the switch to activate the plant This is the first true closed-cycle ocean Thermal Energy Conversion OTEC plant to be connected to a U S electrical grid It is a demo plant capable of generating kilowatts enough to power about homes Thermodynamic efficiency edit A heat engine gives greater efficiency when run with a large temperature difference In the oceans the temperature difference between surface and deep water is greatest in the tropics although still a modest to C It is therefore in the tropics that OTEC offers the greatest possibilities OTEC has the potential to offer global amounts of energy that are to times greater than other ocean energy options such as wave power OTEC plants can operate continuously providing a base load supply for an electrical power generation system The main technical challenge of OTEC is to generate significant amounts of power efficiently from small temperature differences It is still considered an emerging technology Early OTEC systems were to percent thermally efficient well below the theoretical maximum and percent for this temperature difference Modern designs allow performance approaching the theoretical maximum Carnot efficiency Power cycle types edit Cold seawater is an integral part of each of the three types of OTEC systems closed-cycle open-cycle and hybrid To operate the cold seawater must be brought to the surface The primary approaches are active pumping and desalination Desalinating seawater near the sea floor lowers its density which causes it to rise to the surface The alternative to costly pipes to bring condensing cold water to the surface is to pump vaporized low boiling point fluid into the depths to be condensed thus reducing pumping volumes and reducing technical and environmental problems and lowering costs Closed edit Diagram of a closed cycle OTEC plant Closed-cycle systems use fluid with a low boiling point such as ammonia having a boiling point around - C at atmospheric pressure to power a turbine to generate electricity Warm surface seawater is pumped through a heat exchanger to vaporize the fluid The expanding vapor turns the turbo-generator Cold water pumped through a second heat exchanger condenses the vapor into a liquid which is then recycled through the system In the Natural Energy Laboratory and several private-sector partners developed the mini OTEC experiment which achieved the first successful at-sea production of net electrical power from closed-cycle OTEC The mini OTEC vessel was moored miles km off the Hawaiian coast and produced enough net electricity to illuminate the ship s light bulbs and run its computers and television Open edit Diagram of an open cycle OTEC plant Open-cycle OTEC uses warm surface water directly to make electricity The warm seawater is first pumped into a low-pressure container which causes it to boil In some schemes the expanding vapor drives a low-pressure turbine attached to an electrical generator The vapor which has left its salt and other contaminants in the low-pressure container is pure fresh water It is condensed into a liquid by exposure to cold temperatures from deep-ocean water This method produces desalinized fresh water suitable for drinking water irrigation or aquaculture In other schemes the rising vapor is used in a gas lift technique of lifting water to significant heights Depending on the embodiment such vapor lift pump techniques generate power from a hydroelectric turbine either before or after the pump is used In the Solar Energy Research Institute now known as the National Renewable Energy Laboratory developed a vertical-spout evaporator to convert warm seawater into low-pressure steam for open-cycle plants Conversion efficiencies were as high as for seawater-to-steam conversion overall steam production would only be a few percent of the incoming water In May an open-cycle OTEC plant at Keahole Point Hawaii produced close to kW of electricity during a net power-producing experiment This broke the record of kW set by a Japanese system in Hybrid edit A hybrid cycle combines the features of the closed- and open-cycle systems In a hybrid warm seawater enters a vacuum chamber and is flash-evaporated similar to the open-cycle evaporation process The steam vaporizes the ammonia working fluid of a closed-cycle loop on the other side of an ammonia vaporizer The vaporized fluid then drives a turbine to produce electricity The steam condenses within the heat exchanger and provides desalinated water see heat pipe Working fluids edit A popular choice of working fluid is ammonia which has superior transport properties easy availability and low cost Ammonia however is toxic and flammable Fluorinated carbons such as CFCs and HCFCs are not toxic or flammable but they contribute to ozone layer depletion Hydrocarbons too are good candidates but they are highly flammable in addition this would create competition for use of them directly as fuels The power plant size is dependent upon the vapor pressure of the working fluid With increasing vapor pressure the size of the turbine and heat exchangers decreases while the wall thickness of the pipe and heat exchangers increase to endure high pressure especially on the evaporator side Land shelf and floating sites edit OTEC has the potential to produce gigawatts of electrical power and in conjunction with electrolysis could produce enough hydrogen to completely replace all projected global fossil fuel consumption citation needed Reducing costs remains an unsolved challenge however OTEC plants require a long large diameter intake pipe which is submerged a kilometer or more into the ocean s depths to bring cold water to the surface Land-based edit Land-based and near-shore facilities offer three main advantages over those located in deep water Plants constructed on or near land do not require sophisticated mooring lengthy power cables or the more extensive maintenance associated with open-ocean environments They can be installed in sheltered areas so that they are relatively safe from storms and heavy seas Electricity desalinated water and cold nutrient-rich seawater could be transmitted from near-shore facilities via trestle bridges or causeways In addition land-based or near-shore sites allow plants to operate with related industries such as mariculture or those that require desalinated water Favored locations include those with narrow shelves volcanic islands steep degrees offshore slopes and relatively smooth sea floors These sites minimize the length of the intake pipe A land-based plant could be built well inland from the shore offering more protection from storms or on the beach where the pipes would be shorter In either case easy access for construction and operation helps lower costs Land-based or near-shore sites can also support mariculture or chilled water agriculture Tanks or lagoons built on shore allow workers to monitor and control miniature marine environments Mariculture products can be delivered to market via standard transport One disadvantage of land-based facilities arises from the turbulent wave action in the surf zone OTEC discharge pipes should be placed in protective trenches to prevent subjecting them to extreme stress during storms and prolonged periods of heavy seas Also the mixed discharge of cold and warm seawater may need to be carried several hundred meters offshore to reach the proper depth before it is released requiring additional expense in construction and maintenance One way that OTEC systems can avoid some of the problems and expenses of operating in a surf zone is by building them just offshore in waters ranging from to meters deep Ocean Thermal Corporation This type of plant would use shorter and therefore less costly intake and discharge pipes which would avoid the dangers of turbulent surf The plant itself however would require protection from the marine environment such as breakwaters and erosion-resistant foundations and the plant output would need to be transmitted to shore Shelf based edit To avoid the turbulent surf zone as well as to move closer to the cold-water resource OTEC plants can be mounted to the continental shelf at depths up to meters ft A shelf-mounted plant could be towed to the site and affixed to the sea bottom This type of construction is already used for offshore oil rigs The complexities of operating an OTEC plant in deeper water may make them more expensive than land-based approaches Problems include the stress of open-ocean conditions and more difficult product delivery Addressing strong ocean currents and large waves adds engineering and construction expense Platforms require extensive pilings to maintain a stable base Power delivery can require long underwater cables to reach land For these reasons shelf-mounted plants are less attractive citation needed Floating edit Floating OTEC facilities operate off-shore Although potentially optimal for large systems floating facilities present several difficulties The difficulty of mooring plants in very deep water complicates power delivery Cables attached to floating platforms are more susceptible to damage especially during storms Cables at depths greater than meters are difficult to maintain and repair Riser cables which connect the sea bed and the plant need to be constructed to resist entanglement As with shelf-mounted plants floating plants need a stable base for continuous operation Major storms and heavy seas can break the vertically suspended cold-water pipe and interrupt warm water intake as well To help prevent these problems pipes can be made of flexible polyethylene attached to the bottom of the platform and gimballed with joints or collars Pipes may need to be uncoupled from the plant to prevent storm damage As an alternative to a warm-water pipe surface water can be drawn directly into the platform however it is necessary to prevent the intake flow from being damaged or interrupted during violent motions caused by heavy seas Connecting a floating plant to power delivery cables requires the plant to remain relatively stationary Mooring is an acceptable method but current mooring technology is limited to depths of about meters ft Even at shallower depths the cost of mooring may be prohibitive Political concerns edit Because OTEC facilities are more-or-less stationary surface platforms their exact location and legal status may be affected by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea treaty UNCLOS This treaty grants coastal nations -and- -nautical-mile and km zones of varying legal authority from land creating potential conflicts and regulatory barriers OTEC plants and similar structures would be considered artificial islands under the treaty giving them no independent legal status OTEC plants could be perceived as either a threat or potential partner to fisheries or to seabed mining operations controlled by the International Seabed Authority Cost and economics edit Because OTEC systems have not yet been widely deployed cost estimates are uncertain A study by University of Hawaii estimated the cost of electricity for OTEC at cents per kilowatt hour kWh for a MW plant cents per kWh for a MW plant and cents per kWh for a MW plant A report by the organization Ocean Energy Systems under the International Energy Agency gave an estimate of about cents per kWh for MW plants Another study estimated power generation costs as low as cents per kWh Comparing to other energy sources a study by Lazard estimated the unsubsidized cost of electricity to to cents per kWh for Solar PV at utility scale and to cents per kWh for wind power A report published by IRENA in claimed that commercial use of OTEC technology can be scaled in a variety of ways small-scale OTEC plants can be made to accommodate the electricity production of small communities residents but would require the production of valuable by-products like fresh water or cooling to be economically viable Larger scaled OTEC plants would have a much higher overhead and installation costs Beneficial factors that should be taken into account include OTEC s lack of waste products and fuel consumption the area in which it is available citation needed often within of the equator the geopolitical effects of petroleum dependence compatibility with alternate forms of ocean power such as wave energy tidal energy and methane hydrates and supplemental uses for the seawater Some proposed projects edit OTEC projects under consideration include a small plant for the U S Navy base on the British overseas territory island of Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean Ocean Thermal Energy Corporation formerly OCEES International Inc is working with the U S Navy on a design for a proposed -MW OTEC plant to replace the current diesel generators The OTEC plant would also provide million gallons clarification needed per day of potable water This project is currently when waiting for changes in US military contract policies OTE has proposed building a -MW OTEC plant on Guam Bahamas edit Ocean Thermal Energy Corporation OTE currently when has plans to install two MW OTEC plants in the US Virgin Islands and a MW OTEC facility in The Bahamas OTE has also designed the world s largest Seawater Air Conditioning SWAC plant for a resort in The Bahamas which will use cold deep seawater as a method of

agreement had been signed under which the Baha Mar resort will be completed On September Bahamian Prime Minister Perry Christie announced that construction had resumed on Baha Mar and that the resort was slated to open in March This is on hold and may never resume Hawaii edit Lockheed Martin s Alternative Energy Development team has partnered with Makai Ocean Engineering to complete the final design phase of a -MW closed cycle OTEC pilot system which planned to become operational in Hawaii in the time frame This system was designed to expand to -MW commercial systems in the near future In November the U S Naval Facilities Engineering Command NAVFAC awarded Lockheed Martin a US million contract modification to develop critical system components and designs for the plant adding to the million contract and two Department of Energy grants totaling over million in and March A small but operational ocean thermal energy conversion OTEC plant was inaugurated in Hawaii in August The opening of the research and development -kilowatt facility marked the first time a closed-cycle OTEC plant was connected to the U S grid Hainan edit On April Lockheed contracted with the Reignwood Group to build a megawatt plant off the coast of southern China to provide power for a planned resort on Hainan island A plant of that size would power several thousand homes The Reignwood Group acquired Opus Offshore in which forms its Reignwood Ocean Engineering division which also is engaged in development of deepwater drilling Japan edit Currently the only continuously operating OTEC system is located in Okinawa Prefecture Japan The Governmental support local community support and advanced research carried out by Saga University were key for the contractors IHI Plant Construction Co Ltd Yokogawa Electric Corporation and Xenesys Inc to succeed with this project Work is being conducted to develop a MW facility on Kume Island requiring new pipelines In July more than members formed the Global Ocean reSource and Energy Association GOSEA an international organization formed to promote the development of the Kumejima Model and work towards the installation of larger deep seawater pipelines and a MW OTEC Facility The companies involved in the current OTEC projects along with other interested parties have developed plans for offshore OTEC systems as well - For more details see Currently Operating OTEC Plants above United States Virgin Islands edit On March Ocean Thermal Energy Corporation OTEC and the th Legislature of the United States Virgin Islands USVI signed a Memorandum of Understanding to move forward with a study to evaluate the feasibility and potential benefits to the USVI of installing on-shore Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion OTEC renewable energy power plants and Seawater Air Conditioning SWAC facilities The benefits to be assessed in the USVI study include both the baseload clean electricity generated by OTEC as well as the various related products associated with OTEC and SWAC including abundant fresh drinking water energy-saving air conditioning sustainable aquaculture and mariculture and agricultural enhancement projects for the Islands of St Thomas and St Croix On July OTE s application to be a Qualifying Facility was approved by the Virgin Islands Public Services Commission OTE also received permission to begin negotiating contracts associated with this project Kiribati edit South Korea s Research Institute of Ships and Ocean Engineering KRISO received approval in principle from Bureau Veritas for their MW offshore OTEC design No timeline was given for the project which will be located km offshore of the Republic of Kiribati Martinique edit Akuo Energy and DCNS were awarded NER funding on July for their NEMO New Energy for Martinique and Overseas project which is expected to be a MW-net offshore facility completed in The award to help with development totaled million Euro Maldives edit On February Global OTEC Resources announced plans to build a kW plant in the Maldives designed bespoke for hotels and resorts All these resorts draw their power from diesel generators Moreover some individual resorts consume litres of diesel a day to meet demands which equates to over tonnes of CO annually said Director Dan Grech The EU awarded a grant and Global OTEC resources launched a crowdfunding campaign for the rest Related activities edit OTEC has uses other than power production Desalination edit Desalinated water can be produced in open- or hybrid-cycle plants using surface condensers to turn evaporated seawater into potable water System analysis indicates that a -megawatt plant could produce about cubic metres cu ft of desalinated water each day Another system patented by Richard Bailey creates condensate water by regulating deep ocean water flow through surface condensers correlating with fluctuating dew-point temperatures This condensation system uses no incremental energy and has no moving parts On March Saga University opened a Flash-type desalination demonstration facility on Kumejima This satellite of their Institute of Ocean Energy uses post-OTEC deep seawater from the Okinawa OTEC Demonstration Facility and raw surface seawater to produce desalinated water Air is extracted from the closed system with a vacuum pump When raw sea water is pumped into the flash chamber it boils allowing pure steam to rise and the salt and remaining seawater to be removed The steam is returned to liquid in a heat exchanger with cold post-OTEC deep seawater The desalinated water can be used in hydrogen production or drinking water if minerals are added The NELHA plant established in produced an average of gallons of freshwater per day KOYO USA was established in to capitalize on this new economic opportunity KOYO bottles the water produced by the NELHA plant in Hawaii With the capacity to produce one million bottles of water every day KOYO is now Hawaii s biggest exporter with million in sales Air conditioning edit This section may contain material unrelated to the topic of the article Please help improve this section or discuss this issue on the talk page January Learn how and when to remove this message The F C cold seawater made available by an OTEC system creates an opportunity to provide large amounts of cooling to industries and homes near the plant The water can be used in chilled-water coils to provide air conditioning for buildings It is estimated that a pipe foot m in diameter can deliver gallons of water per minute Water at F C could provide more than enough air conditioning for a large building Operating hours per year in lieu of electrical conditioning selling for per kilowatt-hour it would save - in energy bills annually The InterContinental Resort and Thalasso-Spa on the island of Bora Bora uses an SWAC system to air-condition its buildings The system passes seawater through a heat exchanger where it cools freshwater in a closed loop system This freshwater is then pumped to buildings and directly cools the air In Copenhagen Energy opened a district cooling plant in Copenhagen Denmark The plant delivers cold seawater to commercial and industrial buildings and has reduced electricity consumption by percent Ocean Thermal Energy Corporation OTE has designed a -ton SDC system for a vacation resort in The Bahamas Chilled-soil agriculture edit OTEC technology supports chilled-soil agriculture When cold seawater flows through underground pipes it chills the surrounding soil The temperature difference between roots in the cool soil and leaves in the warm air allows plants that evolved in temperate climates to be grown in the subtropics Dr John P Craven Dr Jack Davidson and Richard Bailey patented this process and demonstrated it at a research facility at the Natural Energy Laboratory of Hawaii Authority NELHA The research facility demonstrated that more than different crops can be grown using this system Many normally could not survive in Hawaii or at Keahole Point citation needed Japan has also been researching agricultural uses of Deep Sea Water since at the Okinawa Deep Sea Water Research Institute on Kume Island The Kume Island facilities use regular water cooled by Deep Sea Water in a heat exchanger run through pipes in the ground to cool soil Their techniques have developed an important resource for the island community as they now produce spinach a winter vegetable commercially year round An expansion of the deep seawater agriculture facility was completed by Kumejima Town next to the OTEC Demonstration Facility in The new facility is for researching the economic practicality of chilled-soil agriculture on a larger scale Aquaculture edit Aquaculture is the best-known byproduct because it reduces the financial and energy costs of pumping large volumes of water from the deep ocean Deep ocean water contains high concentrations of essential nutrients that are depleted in surface waters due to biological consumption This artificial upwelling mimics the natural upwellings that are responsible for fertilizing and supporting the world s largest marine ecosystems and the largest densities of life on the planet Cold-water sea animals such as salmon and lobster thrive in this nutrient-rich deep seawater Microalgae such as Spirulina a health food supplement also can be cultivated Deep-ocean water can be combined with surface water to deliver water at an optimal temperature Non-native species such as salmon lobster abalone trout oysters and clams can be raised in pools supplied by OTEC-pumped water This extends the variety of fresh seafood products available for nearby markets Such low-cost refrigeration can be used to maintain the quality of harvested fish which deteriorate quickly in warm tropical regions In Kona Hawaii aquaculture companies working with NELHA generate about million annually a significant portion of Hawaii s GDP Hydrogen production edit Hydrogen can be produced via electrolysis using OTEC electricity Generated steam with electrolyte compounds added to improve efficiency is a relatively pure medium for hydrogen production OTEC can be scaled to generate large quantities of hydrogen The main challenge is cost relative to other energy sources and fuels Mineral extraction edit The ocean contains trace elements in salts and other forms and dissolved in solution In the past most economic analyses concluded that mining the ocean for trace elements would be unprofitable in part because of the energy required to pump the water Mining generally targets minerals that occur in high concentrations and can be extracted easily such as magnesium With OTEC plants supplying water the only cost is for extraction The Japanese investigated the possibility of extracting uranium and found developments in other technologies especially materials sciences were improving the prospects Climate control edit

and the flora and fauna citation needed When sea surface temperatures are relatively high on an area lower atmospheric pressure area is formed compared to atmospheric pressure prevailing on the nearby land mass inducing winds from the landmass towards the ocean Oceanward winds are dry and warm which would not contribute to good rainfall on the landmass compared to landward moist winds For adequate rainfall and comfortable summer ambient temperatures below C on the landmass it is preferred to have landward moist winds from the ocean Creating high pressure zones by artificial upwelling on sea area selectively can also be used to deflect guide the normal monsoon global winds towards the landmass Artificial upwelling of nutrient-rich deep ocean water to the surface also enhances fisheries growth in areas with tropical and temperate weather It would also lead to enhanced carbon sequestration by the oceans from improved algae growth and mass gain by glaciers from the extra snow fall mitigating sea level rise or global warming process citation needed Tropical cyclones also do not pass through the high pressure zones as they intensify by gaining energy from the warm surface waters of the sea The cold deep sea water C is pumped to the sea surface area to suppress the sea surface temperature C by artificial means using electricity produced by mega scale floating wind turbine plants on the deep sea The lower sea water surface temperature would enhance the local ambient pressure so that atmospheric landward winds are created For upwelling the cold sea water a stationary hydraulically driven propeller m diameter is located on the deep sea floor at to m depth with a flexible draft tube extending up to the sea surface The draft tube is anchored to the sea bed at its bottom side and top side to floating pontoons at the sea surface The flexible draft tube would not collapse as its inside pressure is more compared to outside pressure when the colder water is pumped to the sea surface Middle east north east Africa Indian subcontinent and Australia can get relief from hot and dry weather in summer season also prone to erratic rainfall by pumping deep sea water to the sea surface from the Persian gulf Red sea Indian Ocean and Pacific Ocean respectively citation needed Thermodynamics edit A rigorous treatment of OTEC reveals that a C temperature difference will provide as much energy as a hydroelectric plant with m head for the same volume of water flow citation needed The low temperature difference means that water volumes must be very large to extract useful amounts of heat A MW power plant would be expected to pump on the order of million gallons tonnes per minute For comparison pumps must move a mass of water greater than the weight of the battleship Bismarck which weighed tonnes every minute This makes pumping a substantial parasitic drain on energy production in OTEC systems with one Lockheed design consuming MW in pumping costs for every MW net electricity generated For OTEC schemes using heat exchangers to handle this volume of water the exchangers need to be enormous compared to those used in conventional thermal power generation plants making them one of the most critical components due to their impact on overall efficiency A MW OTEC power plant would require exchangers each larger than a -foot shipping container making them the single most expensive component Variation of ocean temperature with depth edit Chart of different thermoclines depth vs temperature based on seasons and latitude The total insolation received by the oceans covering of the earth s surface with clearness index of and average energy retention of is MJ yr MJ yr We can use Beer Lambert Bouguer s law to quantify the solar energy absorption by water d I y d y I displaystyle - frac dI y dy mu I where y is the depth of water I is intensity and is the absorption coefficient Solving the above differential equation I y I exp y displaystyle I y I exp - mu y The absorption coefficient may range from m for very clear fresh water to m for very salty water Since the intensity falls exponentially with depth y heat absorption is concentrated at the top layers Typically in the tropics surface temperature values are in excess of C F while at kilometer mi the temperature is about C F The warmer and hence lighter waters at the surface means there are no thermal convection currents Due to the small temperature gradients heat transfer by conduction is too low to equalize the temperatures The ocean is thus both a practically infinite heat source and a practically infinite heat sink clarification needed This temperature difference varies with latitude and season with the maximum in tropical subtropical and equatorial waters Hence the tropics are generally the best OTEC locations Open Claude cycle edit In this scheme warm surface water at around C F enters an evaporator at pressure slightly below the saturation pressures causing it to vaporize H H f displaystyle H H f Where H f is enthalpy of liquid water at the inlet temperature T This temporarily superheated water undergoes volume boiling as opposed to pool boiling in conventional boilers where the heating surface is in contact Thus the water partially flashes to steam with two-phase equilibrium prevailing Suppose that the pressure inside the evaporator is maintained at the saturation pressure T H H H f x H f g displaystyle H H H f x H fg Here x is the fraction of water by mass that vaporizes The warm water mass flow rate per unit turbine mass flow rate is x The low pressure in the evaporator is maintained by a vacuum pump that also removes the dissolved non-condensable gases from the evaporator The evaporator now contains a mixture of water and steam of very low vapor quality steam content The steam is separated from the water as saturated vapor The remaining water is saturated and is discharged to the ocean in the open cycle The

vapor content now is negligible H H f a t T displaystyle H approx H f at T The temperature differences between stages include that between warm surface water and working steam that between exhaust

Anderson cycle edit As developed starting in the s by J Hilbert Anderson of Sea Solar Power Inc in this cycle Q H is the heat transferred in the evaporator from the warm sea water to the working fluid The working fluid exits the evaporator as a gas near its dew point The high-pressure high-temperature gas then is expanded in the turbine to yield turbine work W T The working fluid is slightly superheated at the turbine exit and the turbine typically has an efficiency of based on reversible adiabatic expansion From the turbine exit the working fluid enters the condenser where it rejects heat -Q C to the cold sea water The condensate is then compressed to the highest pressure in the cycle requiring condensate pump work W C Thus the Anderson closed cycle is a Rankine-type cycle similar to the conventional power plant steam cycle except that in the Anderson cycle the working fluid is never superheated more than a few degrees Fahrenheit Owing to viscosity effects working fluid pressure drops in both the evaporator and the condenser This pressure drop which depends on the types of heat exchangers used must be considered in final design calculations but is ignored here to simplify the analysis Thus the parasitic condensate pump work W C computed here will be lower than if the heat exchanger pressure drop was included The major additional parasitic energy requirements in the OTEC plant are the cold water pump work W CT and the warm water pump work W HT Denoting all other parasitic energy requirements by W A the net work from the OTEC plant W NP is W N P W T W C W C

thermodynamic cycle work becomes W N H T H d s C T C d s displaystyle W N int H T H ds- int C T C ds Subcooled liquid enters the evaporator Due to the heat exchange with warm sea water evaporation takes place and usually superheated vapor leaves the evaporator This vapor drives the turbine and the -phase mixture enters the condenser Usually the subcooled liquid leaves the condenser and finally this liquid is pumped to the evaporator completing a cycle Environmental impact edit Carbon dioxide dissolved in deep cold and high pressure layers is brought up to the surface and released as the water warms citation needed Mixing of deep ocean water with shallower water brings up nutrients and makes them available to shallow water life This may be an advantage for aquaculture of commercially important species but may also unbalance the ecological system around the power plant OTEC plants use very large flows of warm surface seawater and cold deep seawater to generate constant renewable power The deep seawater is oxygen deficient and generally times more nutrient rich in nitrate and nitrite than shallow seawater When these plumes are mixed they are slightly denser than the ambient seawater Though no large scale physical environmental testing of OTEC has been done computer models have been developed to simulate the effect of OTEC plants Hydrodynamic modeling edit In a computer model was developed to simulate the physical oceanographic effects of one or several megawatt OTEC plant s The model suggests that OTEC plants can be configured such that the plant can conduct continuous operations with resulting temperature and nutrient variations that are within naturally occurring levels Studies to date suggest that by discharging the OTEC flows downwards at a depth below meters the dilution is adequate and nutrient enrichment is small enough so that -megawatt OTEC plants could be operated in a sustainable manner on a continuous basis Biological modeling edit The nutrients from an OTEC discharge could potentially cause increased biological activity if they accumulate in large quantities in the photic zone In a biological component was added to the hydrodynamic computer model to simulate the biological response to plumes from megawatt OTEC plants In all cases modeled discharge at meters depth or more no unnatural variations occurs in the upper meters of the ocean s surface The picoplankton response in the - meter depth layer is approximately a increase which is well within naturally occurring variability The nanoplankton response is negligible The enhanced productivity of diatoms microplankton is small The subtle phytoplankton increase of the baseline OTEC plant suggests that higher-order biochemical effects will be very small Studies edit A previous Final Environmental Impact Statement EIS for the United States NOAA from is available but needs to be brought up to current oceanographic and engineering standards Studies have been done to propose the best environmental baseline monitoring practices focusing on a set of ten chemical oceanographic parameters relevant to OTEC Most recently NOAA held an OTEC Workshop in and seeking to assess the physical chemical and biological impacts and risks and identify information gaps or needs The Tethys database provides access to scientific literature and general information on the potential environmental effects of OTEC Technical difficulties edit Dissolved gases edit The performance of direct contact heat exchangers operating at typical OTEC boundary conditions is important to the Claude cycle Many early Claude cycle designs used a surface condenser since their performance was well understood However direct contact condensers offer significant disadvantages As cold water rises in the intake pipe the pressure decreases to the point where gas begins to evolve If a significant amount of gas comes out of solution placing a gas trap before the direct contact heat exchangers may be justified Experiments simulating conditions in the warm water intake pipe indicated about of the dissolved gas evolves in the top meters ft of the tube The trade-off between pre-deaeration of the seawater and expulsion of non-condensable gases from the condenser is dependent on the gas evolution dynamics deaerator efficiency head loss vent compressor efficiency and parasitic power Experimental results indicate vertical spout condensers perform some better than falling jet types Microbial fouling edit Because raw seawater must pass through the heat exchanger care must be taken to maintain good thermal conductivity Biofouling layers as thin as to micrometres to in can degrade heat exchanger performance by as much as A study in which mock heat exchangers were exposed to seawater for ten weeks concluded that although the level of microbial fouling was low the thermal conductivity of the system was significantly impaired The apparent discrepancy between the level of fouling and the heat transfer impairment is the result of a thin layer of water trapped by the microbial growth on the surface of the heat exchanger Another study concluded that fouling degrades performance over time and determined that although regular brushing was able to remove most of the microbial layer over time a tougher layer formed that could not be removed through simple brushing The study passed sponge rubber balls through the system It concluded that although the ball treatment decreased the fouling rate it was not enough to completely halt growth and brushing was occasionally necessary to restore capacity The microbes regrew more quickly later in the experiment i e brushing became necessary more often replicating the results of a previous study The increased growth rate after subsequent cleanings appears to result from selection pressure on the microbial colony Continuous use of hour per day and intermittent periods of free fouling and then chlorination periods again hour per day were studied Chlorination slowed but did not stop microbial growth however chlorination levels of mg per liter for hour per day may prove effective for long term operation of a plant The study concluded that although microbial fouling was an issue for the warm surface water heat exchanger the cold water heat exchanger suffered little or no biofouling and only minimal inorganic fouling Besides water temperature microbial fouling also depends on nutrient levels with growth occurring faster in nutrient rich water The fouling rate also depends on the material used to construct the heat exchanger Aluminium tubing slows the growth of microbial life although the oxide layer which forms on the inside of the pipes complicates cleaning and leads to larger efficiency losses In contrast titanium tubing allows biofouling to occur faster but cleaning is more effective than with aluminium Sealing edit The evaporator turbine and condenser operate in partial vacuum ranging from to of atmospheric pressure The system must be carefully sealed to prevent in-leakage of atmospheric air that can degrade or shut down operation In closed-cycle OTEC the specific volume of low-pressure steam is very large compared to that of the pressurized working fluid Components must have large flow areas to ensure steam velocities do not attain excessively high values Parasitic power consumption by exhaust compressor edit An approach for reducing the exhaust compressor parasitic power loss is as follows After most of the steam has been condensed by spout condensers the non-condensible gas steam mixture is passed through a counter current region which increases the gas-steam reaction by a factor of five The result is an reduction in the exhaust pumping power requirements Cold air warm water conversion edit Further information Lake Vanda In winter in coastal Arctic locations the temperature difference between the seawater and ambient air can be as high as C F Closed-cycle systems could exploit the air-water temperature difference Eliminating seawater extraction pipes might make a system based on this concept less expensive than OTEC This technology is due to H Barjot who suggested butane as cryogen because of its boiling point of C F and its non-solubility in water Assuming a realistic level of efficiency of calculations show that the amount of energy generated with one cubic meter water at a temperature of C F in a place with an air temperature of C F equals the amount of energy generated by letting this cubic meter water run through a hydroelectric plant of feet m height Barjot Polar Power Plants could be located on islands in the polar region or designed as swimming barges or platforms attached to the ice cap The weather station Myggbuka at Greenlands east coast for example which is only km away from Glasgow detects monthly mean temperatures below C F during winter months in the year Application of the thermoelectric effect edit In SERI proposed using the Seebeck effect to produce power with a total conversion efficiency of In Liping Liu Associate Professor at Rutgers University envisioned an OTEC system that utilises the solid state thermoelectric effect rather than the fluid cycles traditionally used See also edit Energy portal Deep water source cooling Geothermal power Heat engine Floating wind turbine Ocean

power Tidal stream generator Wave power Wind power Nuclear power proposed as renewable energy Topics by country and territory Marketing and policy trends v t e Osmotic power salinity gradient power or blue energy is the energy available from the difference in the salt concentration between seawater and river water Two practical methods for this are reverse electrodialysis RED and pressure retarded osmosis PRO Both processes rely on osmosis with membranes The key waste product is brackish water This byproduct is the result of natural forces that are being harnessed the flow of fresh water into seas that are made up of salt water In Pattle suggested that there was an untapped source of power when a river mixes with the sea in terms of the lost osmotic pressure however it was not until the mid- s when a practical method of harnessing it using selectively permeable membranes by Loeb was outlined The method of generating power by pressure retarded osmosis was invented by Sidney Loeb in at the Ben-Gurion University of the Negev Beersheba Israel The idea came to Loeb in part as he observed the Jordan River flowing into the Dead Sea He wanted to harvest the energy of mixing of the two aqueous solutions the Jordan River being one and the Dead Sea being the other that was going to waste in this natural mixing process In Loeb invented a method of producing power by a reverse electrodialysis heat engine The technologies have been confirmed in laboratory conditions They are being developed for commercial use in the Netherlands RED and Norway PRO The cost of the membrane has been an obstacle A new lower cost membrane based on an electrically modified polyethylene plastic made it fit for potential commercial use Other methods have been proposed and are currently under development Among them are a method based on electric double-layer capacitor technology and a method based on vapor pressure difference Basics of salinity gradient power edit Pressure-retarded osmosis Salinity gradient power is a specific renewable energy alternative that creates renewable and sustainable power by using naturally occurring processes This practice does not contaminate or release carbon dioxide CO emissions vapor pressure methods will release dissolved air containing CO at low pressures these non-condensable gases can be re-dissolved of course but with an energy penalty Also as stated by Jones and Finley within their article Recent Development in Salinity Gradient Power there is basically no fuel cost Salinity gradient energy is based on using the resources of osmotic pressure difference between fresh water and sea water All energy that is proposed to use salinity gradient technology relies on evaporation to separate water from salt Osmotic pressure is the chemical potential of concentrated and dilute solutions of salt When looking at relations between high osmotic pressure and low solutions with higher concentrations of salt have higher pressure Various salinity gradient power generations exist one of the most commonly discussed is pressure-retarded osmosis PRO Within PRO seawater is pumped into a pressure chamber where the pressure is lower than the difference between fresh and salt water pressure Fresh water moves in a semipermeable membrane and increases its volume in the chamber As the pressure in the chamber is compensated a turbine spins to generate electricity In Braun s article he states that this process is easy to understand in a more broken down manner Two solutions A being salt water and B being fresh water are separated by a membrane He states only water molecules can pass the semipermeable membrane As a result of the osmotic pressure difference between both solutions the water from solution B thus will diffuse through the membrane in order to dilute solution A The pressure drives the turbines and power the generator that produces the electrical energy Osmosis might be used directly to pump fresh water out of The Netherlands into the sea This is currently done using electric pumps Efficiency edit A study on efficiency from Yale University concluded that the highest extractable work in constant-pressure PRO with a seawater draw solution and river water feed solution is kWh m kJ L while the free energy of mixing is kWh m kJ L a thermodynamic extraction efficiency of Methods edit While the mechanics and concepts of salinity gradient power are still being studied the power source has been implemented in several different locations Most of these are experimental but thus far they have been predominantly successful The various companies that have utilized this power have also done so in many different ways as there are several concepts and processes that harness the power from salinity gradient Pressure-retarded osmosis edit Simple PRO power generation scheme Osmotic Power Prototype at Tofte Hurum Norway One method to utilize salinity gradient energy is called pressure-retarded osmosis In this method seawater is pumped into a pressure chamber that is at a pressure lower than the difference between the pressures of saline water and fresh water Freshwater is also pumped into the pressure chamber through a membrane which increase both the volume and pressure of the chamber As the pressure differences are compensated a turbine is spun providing kinetic energy This method is being specifically studied by the Norwegian utility Statkraft which has calculated that up to GW would be available from this process in Norway Statkraft has built the world s first prototype PRO power plant on the Oslo fjord which was opened on November It aimed to produce enough electricity to light and heat a small town within five years by osmosis At first it did produce a minuscule kilowatts enough to heat a large electric kettle but by the target was megawatts the same as a small wind farm In January however Statkraft announced not to continue this pilot Statkraft found that with existing technology the salt gradient was not high enough to be economic which other studies have confirmed Higher salt gradients can be found in geothermal brines and desalination plant brines and SaltPower a Danish company is now building its first commercial plant with high salinity brine There is perhaps more potential in integrating Pressure Retarded Osmosis as an operating mode of reverse osmosis rather than a stand-alone technology Reversed electrodialysis edit RED-prototype of REDstack at the Afsluitdijk in The Netherlands A second method being developed and studied is reversed electrodialysis or reverse dialysis which is essentially the creation of a salt battery This method was described by Weinstein and Leitz as an array of alternating anion and cation exchange membranes can be used to generate electric power from the free energy of river and sea water The technology related to this type of power is still in its infant stages even though the principle was discovered in the s Standards and a complete understanding of all the ways salinity gradients can be utilized are important goals to strive for in order to make this clean energy source more viable in the future Capacitive method edit A third method is Doriano Brogioli s capacitive method which is relatively new and has so far only been tested on lab scale With this method energy can be extracted out of the mixing of saline water and freshwater by cyclically charging up electrodes in contact with saline water followed by a discharge in freshwater Since the amount of electrical energy which is needed during the charging step is less than one gets out during the discharge step each completed cycle effectively produces energy An intuitive explanation of this effect is that the great number of ions in the saline water efficiently neutralizes the charge on each electrode by forming a thin layer of opposite charge very close to the electrode surface known as an electric double layer Therefore the voltage over the electrodes remains low during the charge step and charging is relatively easy In between the charge and discharge step the electrodes are brought in contact with freshwater After this there are fewer ions available to neutralize the charge on each electrode such that the voltage over the electrodes increases The discharge step which follows is therefore able to deliver a relatively high amount of energy A physical explanation is that on an electrically charged capacitor there is a mutually attractive electric force between the electric charge on the electrode and the ionic charge in the liquid In order to pull ions away from the charged electrode osmotic pressure must do work This work done increases the electrical potential energy in the capacitor An electronic explanation is that capacitance is a function of ion density By introducing a salinity gradient and allowing some of the ions to diffuse out of the capacitor this reduces the capacitance and so the voltage must increase since the voltage equals the ratio of charge to capacitance Vapor pressure differences open cycle and absorption refrigeration cycle closed cycle edit Both of these methods do not rely on membranes so filtration requirements are not as important as they are in the PRO RED schemes Open cycle edit Similar to the open cycle in ocean thermal energy conversion OTEC The disadvantage of this cycle is the cumbersome problem of a large diameter turbine meters operating at below atmospheric pressure to extract the power between the water with less salinity the water with greater salinity Absorption refrigeration cycle closed cycle edit For the purpose of dehumidifying air in a water-spray absorption refrigeration system water vapor is dissolved into a deliquescent salt water mixture using osmotic power as an intermediary The primary power source originates from a thermal difference as part of a thermodynamic heat engine cycle Solar pond edit At the Eddy Potash Mine in New Mexico a technology called salinity gradient solar pond SGSP is being utilized to provide the energy needed by the mine This method does not harness osmotic power only solar power see solar pond Sunlight reaching the bottom of the saltwater pond is absorbed as heat The effect of natural convection wherein heat rises is blocked using density differences between the three layers that make up the pond in order to trap heat The upper convection zone is the uppermost zone followed by the stable gradient zone then the bottom thermal zone The stable gradient zone is the most important The saltwater in this layer can not rise to the higher zone because the saltwater above has lower salinity and is therefore less-dense and more buoyant and it can not sink to the lower level because that saltwater is denser This middle zone the stable gradient zone effectively becomes an insulator for the bottom layer although the main purpose is to block natural convection since water is a poor insulator This water from the lower layer the storage zone is pumped out and the heat is used to produce energy usually by turbine in an organic Rankine cycle In theory a solar pond could be used to generate osmotic power if evaporation from solar heat is used to create a salinity gradient and the potential energy in this salinity gradient is harnessed directly using one of the first three methods above such as the capacitive method Boron nitride nanotubes edit A research team built an experimental system using boron nitride that produced much greater power than the Statkraft prototype It used an impermeable and electrically insulating membrane that was pierced by a single boron nitride nanotube with an external diameter of a few dozen nanometers With this membrane separating a salt water reservoir and a fresh water reservoir the team measured the electric current passing through the membrane using two electrodes immersed in the fluid either side of the nanotube The results showed the device was able to generate an electric current on the order of a nanoampere The researchers claim this is times the yield of other known techniques for harvesting osmotic energy and makes boron nitride nanotubes an extremely efficient solution for harvesting the energy of salinity gradients for usable electrical power The team claimed that a square metre sq ft membrane could generate around kW and be capable of generating up to MWh per year At the fall meeting of the Materials Research Society a team from Rutgers University reported creating a membrane that contained around million BNNTs per cubic centimeter Using low caloric waste energy by regenerate a high solution ammonium bicarbonate in a solution with a low salinity edit At Pennsylvania State University Dr Logan tries to use waste heat with low calority using the fact that ammonium bicarbonate decomposes into NH and CO in warm water to form ammonium bicarbonate again in cold water So in a RED energy producing closed system the two different gradients of salinity are kept Possible negative environmental impact edit Marine and river environments have obvious differences in water quality namely salinity Each species of aquatic plant and animal is adapted to survive in either marine brackish or freshwater environments There are species that can tolerate both but these species usually thrive best in a specific water environment The main waste product of salinity gradient technology is brackish water The discharge of brackish water into the surrounding waters if done in large quantities and with any regularity will cause salinity fluctuations While some variation in salinity is usual particularly where fresh water rivers empties into an ocean or sea anyway these variations become less important for both bodies of water with the addition of brackish waste waters Extreme salinity changes in an aquatic environment may result in findings of low densities of both animals and plants due to intolerance of sudden severe salinity drops or spikes According to the prevailing environmentalist opinions the possibility of these negative effects should be considered by the operators of future large blue energy establishments The impact of brackish water on ecosystems can be minimized by pumping it out to sea and releasing it into the mid-layer away from the surface and bottom ecosystems Impingement and entrainment at intake structures are a concern due to large volumes of both river and sea water utilized in both PRO and RED schemes Intake construction permits must meet strict environmental regulations and desalination plants and power plants that utilize surface water are sometimes involved with various local state and federal agencies to obtain permission that can take upwards to months The Tethys database provides access to scientific literature and general information on the potential environmental effects of salinity gradient power See also edit Energy portal

light and heat which can be harnessed using a range of technologies such as solar electricity solar thermal energy including solar water heating and solar architecture It is an essential source of renewable energy and its technologies are broadly characterized as either passive solar or active solar depending on how they capture and distribute solar energy or convert it into solar power Active solar techniques include the use of photovoltaic systems concentrated solar power and solar water heating to harness the energy Passive solar techniques include designing a building for better daylighting selecting materials with favorable thermal mass or light-dispersing properties and organizing spaces that naturally circulate air In the International Energy Agency said that the development of affordable inexhaustible and clean solar energy technologies will have huge longer-term benefits It will increase countries energy security through reliance on an indigenous inexhaustible and mostly import-independent resource enhance sustainability reduce pollution lower the costs of mitigating global warming these advantages are global Potential Further information Solar radiation About half the incoming solar energy reaches the Earth s surface Average insolation The theoretical area of the small black dots is sufficient to supply the world s total energy needs of TW with solar power Global map of horizontal irradiation The Earth receives petawatts PW of incoming solar radiation insolation at the upper atmosphere Approximately is reflected back to space while the rest PW is absorbed by clouds oceans and land masses The spectrum of solar light at the Earth s surface is mostly spread across the visible and near-infrared ranges with a small part in the near-ultraviolet Most of the world s population live in areas with insolation levels of watts m or kWh m per day Solar radiation is absorbed by the Earth s land surface oceans which cover about of the globe and atmosphere Warm air containing evaporated water from the oceans rises causing atmospheric circulation or convection When the air reaches a high altitude where the temperature is low water vapor condenses into clouds which rain onto the Earth s surface completing the water cycle The latent heat of water condensation amplifies convection producing atmospheric phenomena such as wind cyclones and anticyclones Sunlight absorbed by the oceans and land masses keeps the surface at an average temperature of C By photosynthesis green plants convert solar energy into chemically stored energy which produces food wood and the biomass from which fossil fuels are derived The total solar energy absorbed by Earth s atmosphere oceans and land masses is approximately PW year exajoules EJ per year In this was more energy in one hour one hour and minutes than the world used in one year Photosynthesis captures approximately EJ per year in biomass Yearly solar fluxes human consumption Solar Wind Biomass potential Primary energy use Electricity Energy given in Exajoule EJ J TWh Consumption as of year The potential solar energy that could be used by humans differs from the amount of solar energy present near the surface of the planet because factors such as geography time variation cloud cover and the land available to humans limit the amount of solar energy that we can acquire In Carbon Tracker Initiative estimated the land area needed to generate all our energy from solar alone was km or about the same as the area of Sweden or the area of Morocco or the area of California of the Earth s total land area Solar technologies are categorized as either passive or active depending on the way they capture convert and distribute sunlight and enable solar energy to be harnessed at different levels around the world mostly depending on the distance from the Equator Although solar energy refers primarily to the use of solar radiation for practical ends all types of renewable energy other than geothermal power and tidal power are derived either directly or indirectly from the Sun Active solar techniques use photovoltaics concentrated solar power solar thermal collectors pumps and fans to convert sunlight into useful output Passive solar techniques include selecting materials with favorable thermal properties designing spaces that naturally circulate air and referencing clarification needed the position of a building to the Sun Active solar technologies increase the supply of energy and are considered supply side technologies while passive solar technologies reduce the need for alternative resources and are generally considered demand-side technologies In the United Nations Development Programme UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs and World Energy Council published an estimate of the potential solar energy that could be used by humans each year This took into account factors such as insolation cloud cover and the land that is usable by humans It was stated that solar energy has a global potential of to exajoules to kWh per year see table below Annual solar energy potential by region Exajoules Region North America Latin

Assessment Thermal energy Main article Solar thermal energy Solar thermal technologies can be used for water heating space heating space cooling and process heat generation Early commercial adaptation In at the Universal Exposition in Paris Augustin Mouchot successfully demonstrated a solar steam engine but could not continue development because of cheap coal and other factors patent drawing of Shuman s solar collector In Frank Shuman a US inventor engineer and solar energy pioneer built a small demonstration solar engine that worked by reflecting solar energy onto square boxes filled with ether which has a lower boiling point than water and were fitted internally with black pipes which in turn powered a steam engine In Shuman formed the Sun Power Company with the intent of building larger solar power plants He along with his technical advisor A S E Ackermann and British physicist Sir Charles Vernon Boys developed an improved system using mirrors to reflect solar energy upon collector boxes increasing heating capacity to the extent that water could now be used instead of ether Shuman then constructed a full-scale steam engine powered by low-pressure water enabling him to patent the entire solar engine system by Shuman built the world s first solar thermal power station in Maadi Egypt between and His plant used parabolic troughs to power a kilowatts hp engine that pumped more than litres imp gal US gal of water per minute from the Nile River to adjacent cotton fields Although the outbreak of World War I and the discovery of cheap oil in the s discouraged the advancement of solar energy Shuman s vision and basic design were resurrected in the s with a new wave of interest in solar thermal energy In Shuman was quoted in the media advocating solar energy s utilization saying We have proved the commercial profit of sun power in the tropics and have more particularly proved that after our stores of oil and coal are exhausted the human race can receive unlimited power from the rays of the Sun Frank Shuman New York Times July Water heating Main articles Solar hot water and Solar combisystem Solar water heaters facing the Sun to maximize gain Solar hot water systems use sunlight to heat water In middle geographical latitudes between degrees north and degrees south to of the domestic hot water use with water temperatures up to C F can be provided by solar heating systems The most common types of solar water heaters are evacuated tube collectors and glazed flat plate collectors generally used for domestic hot water and unglazed plastic collectors used mainly to heat swimming pools As of the total installed capacity of solar hot water systems was approximately thermal gigawatt GW th and China is the world leader in their deployment with GW th installed taken up of the market Israel and Cyprus are the per capita leaders in the use of solar hot water systems with over of homes using them In the United States Canada and Australia heating swimming pools is the dominant application of solar hot water with an installed capacity of GW th as of Heating cooling and ventilation Main articles Solar heating Thermal mass Solar chimney and Solar air conditioning In the United States heating ventilation and air conditioning HVAC systems account for EJ yr of the energy used in commercial buildings and nearly EJ yr of the energy used in residential buildings Solar heating cooling and ventilation technologies can be used to offset a portion of this energy Use of solar for heating can roughly be divided into passive solar concepts and active solar concepts depending on whether active elements such as sun tracking and solar concentrator optics are used MIT s Solar House built in in the US used seasonal thermal energy storage for year-round heating Thermal mass is any material that can be used to store heat heat from the Sun in the case of solar energy Common thermal mass materials include stone cement and water Historically they have been used in arid climates or warm temperate regions to keep buildings cool by absorbing solar energy during the day and radiating stored heat to the cooler atmosphere at night However they can be used in cold temperate areas to maintain warmth as well The size and placement of thermal mass depend on several factors such as climate daylighting and shading conditions When duly incorporated thermal mass maintains space temperatures in a comfortable range and reduces the need for auxiliary heating and cooling equipment A solar chimney or thermal chimney in this context is a passive solar ventilation system composed of a vertical shaft connecting the interior and exterior of a building As the chimney warms the air inside is heated causing an updraft that pulls air through the building Performance can be improved by using glazing and thermal mass materials in a way that mimics greenhouses Deciduous trees and plants have been promoted as a means of controlling solar heating and cooling When planted on the southern side of a building in the northern hemisphere or the northern side in the southern hemisphere their leaves provide shade during the summer while the bare limbs allow light to pass during the winter Since bare leafless trees shade to of incident solar radiation there is a balance between the benefits of summer shading and the corresponding loss of winter heating In climates with significant heating loads deciduous trees should not be planted on the Equator-facing side of a building because they will interfere with winter solar availability They can however be used on the east and west sides to provide a degree of summer shading without appreciably affecting winter solar gain Cooking Main article Solar cooker Parabolic dish produces steam for cooking in Auroville India Solar cookers use sunlight for cooking drying and pasteurization They can be grouped into three broad categories box cookers panel cookers and reflector cookers The simplest solar cooker is the box cooker first built by Horace de Saussure in A basic box cooker consists of an insulated container with a transparent lid It can be used effectively with partially overcast skies and will typically reach temperatures of C F Panel cookers use a reflective panel to direct sunlight onto an insulated container and reach temperatures comparable to box cookers Reflector cookers use various concentrating geometries dish trough Fresnel mirrors to focus light on a cooking container These cookers reach temperatures of C F and above but require direct light to function properly and must be repositioned to track the Sun Process heat Main articles Solar pond Salt evaporation pond and Solar furnace Solar concentrating technologies such as parabolic dish trough and Scheffler reflectors can provide process heat for commercial and industrial applications The first commercial system was the Solar Total Energy Project STEP in Shenandoah Georgia US where a field of parabolic dishes provided of the process heating air conditioning and electrical requirements for a clothing factory This grid-connected cogeneration system provided kW of electricity plus thermal energy in the form of kW steam and kW chilled water and had a one-hour peak load thermal storage Evaporation ponds are shallow pools that concentrate dissolved solids through evaporation The use of evaporation ponds to obtain salt from seawater is one of the oldest applications of solar energy Modern uses include concentrating brine solutions used in leach mining and removing dissolved solids from waste streams Clothes lines clotheshorses and clothes racks dry clothes through evaporation by wind and sunlight without consuming electricity or gas In some states of the United States legislation protects the right to dry clothes Unglazed transpired collectors UTC are perforated sun-facing walls used for preheating ventilation air UTCs can raise the incoming air temperature up to C F and deliver outlet temperatures of C F The short payback period of transpired collectors to years makes them a more cost-effective alternative than glazed collection systems As of over systems with a combined collector area of square metres sq ft had been installed worldwide including an m sq ft collector in Costa Rica used for drying coffee beans and a m sq ft collector in Coimbatore India used for drying marigolds needs update Water treatment Main articles Solar still Solar water disinfection Solar desalination and Solar Powered Desalination Unit Solar water disinfection in Indonesia Solar distillation can be used to make saline or brackish water potable The first recorded instance of this was by th-century Arab alchemists A large-scale solar distillation project was first constructed in in the Chilean mining town of Las Salinas The plant which had solar collection area of m sq ft could produce up to L imp gal US gal per day and operate for years Individual still designs include single-slope double-slope or greenhouse type vertical conical inverted absorber multi-wick and multiple effect These stills can operate in passive active or hybrid modes Double-slope stills are the most economical for decentralized domestic purposes while active multiple effect units are more suitable for large-scale applications Solar water disinfection SODIS involves exposing water-filled plastic polyethylene terephthalate PET bottles to sunlight for several hours Exposure times vary depending on weather and climate from a minimum of six hours to two days during fully overcast conditions It is recommended by the World Health Organization as a viable method for household water treatment and safe storage Over two million people in developing countries use this method for their daily drinking water Solar energy may be used in a water stabilization pond to treat waste water without chemicals or electricity A further environmental advantage is that algae grow in such ponds and consume carbon dioxide in photosynthesis although algae may produce toxic chemicals that make the water unusable Molten salt technology Molten salt can be employed as a thermal energy storage method to retain thermal energy collected by a solar tower or solar trough of a concentrated solar power plant so that it can be used to generate electricity in bad weather or at night It was demonstrated in the Solar Two project from to The system is predicted to have an annual efficiency of a reference to the energy retained by storing heat before turning it into electricity versus converting heat directly into electricity The molten salt mixtures vary The most extended mixture contains sodium nitrate potassium nitrate and calcium nitrate It is non-flammable and non-toxic and has already been used in the chemical and metals industries as a heat-transport fluid Hence experience with such systems exists in non-solar applications The salt melts at C F It is kept liquid at C F in an insulated cold storage tank The liquid salt is pumped through panels in a solar collector where the focused irradiance heats it to C F It is then sent to a hot storage tank This is so well insulated that the thermal energy can be usefully stored for up to a week When electricity is needed the hot salt is pumped to a conventional steam-generator to produce superheated steam for a turbine generator as used in any conventional coal oil or nuclear power plant A -megawatt turbine would need a tank about metres ft tall and metres ft in diameter to drive it for four hours by this design Several parabolic trough power plants in Spain and solar power tower developer SolarReserve use this thermal energy storage concept The Solana Generating Station in the U S has six hours of storage by molten salt In Chile The Cerro Dominador power plant has a MW solar-thermal tower the heat is transferred to molten salts The molten salts then transfer their heat in a heat exchanger to water generating superheated steam which feeds a turbine that transforms the kinetic energy of the steam into electric energy using the Rankine cycle In this way the Cerro Dominador plant is capable of generating around MW of power The plant has an advanced storage system enabling it to generate electricity for up to hours without direct solar radiation which allows it to provide a stable electricity supply without interruptions if required The Project secured up to GW h per year sale Another project is the Mar a Elena plant is a MW thermo-solar complex in the northern Chilean region of Antofagasta employing molten salt technology Electricity production Greencap Energy solar array on NHS hospital in Keighley England These paragraphs are an excerpt from Solar power edit Solar power also known as solar electricity is the conversion of energy from sunlight into electricity either directly using photovoltaics PV or indirectly using concentrated solar power Solar panels use the photovoltaic effect to convert light into an electric current Concentrated solar power systems use lenses or mirrors and solar tracking systems to focus a large area of sunlight to a hot spot often to drive a steam turbine Photovoltaics PV were initially solely used as a source of electricity for small and medium-sized applications from the calculator powered by a single solar cell to remote homes powered by an off-grid rooftop PV system Commercial concentrated solar power plants were first developed in the s Since then as the cost of solar panels has fallen grid-connected solar PV systems capacity and production has doubled about every three years Three-quarters of new generation capacity is solar with both millions of rooftop installations and gigawatt-scale photovoltaic power stations continuing to be built In solar power generated of global electricity and over of primary energy by the substitution method adding twice as much new electricity as coal Along with onshore wind power utility-scale solar is the source with the cheapest levelised cost of electricity for new installations in most countries China has about half the world s solar power Almost half the solar power installed in was mounted on rooftops Much more low-carbon power is needed for electrification and to limit climate change The International Energy Agency said in that more effort was needed for grid integration and the mitigation of policy regulation and financing challenges Nevertheless solar may greatly cut the cost of energy Solar is important for energy security Concentrated solar power Main article Concentrated solar power Concentrating Solar Power CSP systems use lenses or mirrors and tracking systems to focus a large area of sunlight into a small beam The concentrated heat is then used as a heat source for a conventional power plant A wide range of concentrating technologies exists the most developed are the parabolic trough the solar tower collectors the concentrating linear Fresnel reflector and the Stirling dish Various techniques are used to track the Sun and focus light In all of these systems a working fluid is heated by the concentrated sunlight and is then used for power generation or energy storage Designs need to account for the risk of a dust storm hail or another extreme weather event that can damage the fine glass surfaces of solar power plants Metal grills would allow a high percentage of sunlight to enter the mirrors and solar panels while also preventing most damage Architecture and urban planning Main articles Passive solar building design and Urban heat island Darmstadt University of Technology Germany won the Solar Decathlon in Washington DC with this passive house designed for humid and hot subtropical climate Sunlight has influenced building design since the beginning of architectural history Advanced solar architecture and urban planning methods were first employed by the Greeks and Chinese who oriented their buildings toward the south to provide light and warmth The common features of passive solar architecture are orientation relative to the Sun compact proportion a low surface area to volume ratio selective shading overhangs and thermal mass When these features are tailored to the local climate and environment they can produce well-lit spaces that stay in a comfortable temperature range Socrates Megaron House is a classic example of passive solar design The most recent approaches to solar design use computer modeling tying together solar lighting heating and ventilation systems in an integrated solar design package Active solar equipment such as pumps fans and switchable windows can complement passive design and improve system performance Urban heat islands UHI are metropolitan areas with higher temperatures than that of the surrounding environment The higher temperatures result from increased absorption of solar energy by urban materials such as asphalt and concrete which have lower albedos and higher heat capacities than those in the natural environment A straightforward method of counteracting the UHI effect is to paint buildings and roads white and to plant trees in the area Using these methods a hypothetical cool communities program in Los Angeles has projected that urban temperatures could be reduced by approximately C at an estimated cost of US billion giving estimated total annual benefits of US million from reduced air-conditioning costs and healthcare savings Agriculture and horticulture Greenhouses like these in the Westland municipality of the Netherlands grow vegetables fruits and flowers Agriculture and horticulture seek to optimize the capture of solar energy to optimize the productivity of plants Techniques such as timed planting cycles tailored row orientation staggered heights between rows and the mixing of plant varieties can improve crop yields While sunlight is generally considered a plentiful resource the exceptions highlight the importance of solar energy to agriculture During the short growing seasons of the Little Ice Age French and English farmers employed fruit walls to maximize the collection of solar energy These walls acted as thermal masses and accelerated ripening by keeping plants warm Early fruit walls were built perpendicular to the ground and facing south but over time sloping walls were developed to make better use of sunlight In Nicolas Fatio de Duillier even suggested using a tracking mechanism which could pivot to follow the Sun Applications of solar energy in agriculture aside from growing crops include pumping water drying crops brooding chicks and drying chicken manure More recently the technology has been embraced by vintners who use the energy generated by solar panels to power grape presses Greenhouses convert solar light to heat enabling year-round production and the growth in enclosed environments of specialty crops and other plants not naturally suited to the local climate Primitive greenhouses were first used during Roman times to produce cucumbers year-round for the Roman emperor Tiberius The first modern greenhouses were built in Europe in the th century to keep exotic plants brought back from explorations abroad Greenhouses remain an important part of horticulture today Plastic transparent materials have also been used to similar effect in polytunnels and row covers Transport Main articles Solar vehicle Solar-charged vehicle Electric boat Solar balloon and Solar aircraft Winner of the World Solar Challenge in Australia Solar electric aircraft circumnavigating the globe in Development of a solar-powered car has been an engineering goal since the s The World Solar Challenge is a biannual solar-powered car race where teams from universities and enterprises compete over kilometres mi across central Australia from Darwin to Adelaide In when it was founded the winner s average speed was kilometres per hour mph and by the winner s average speed had improved to kilometres per hour mph The North American Solar Challenge and the planned South African Solar Challenge are comparable competitions that reflect an international interest in the engineering and development of solar powered vehicles Some vehicles use solar panels for auxiliary power such as for air conditioning to keep the interior cool thus reducing fuel consumption In the first practical solar boat was constructed in England By passenger boats incorporating PV panels began appearing and are now used extensively In Kenichi Horie made the first solar-powered crossing of the Pacific Ocean and the Sun catamaran made the first solar-powered crossing of the Atlantic Ocean in the winter of There were plans to circumnavigate the globe in In the unmanned AstroFlight Sunrise airplane made the first solar flight On April the Solar Riser made the first flight in a solar-powered fully controlled man-carrying flying machine reaching an altitude of ft m In the Gossamer Penguin made the first piloted flights powered solely by photovoltaics This was quickly followed by the Solar Challenger which crossed the English Channel in July In Eric Scott Raymond in hops flew from California to North Carolina using solar power Developments then turned back to unmanned aerial vehicles UAV with the Pathfinder and subsequent designs culminating in the Helios which set the altitude record for a non-rocket-propelled aircraft at metres ft in The Zephyr developed by BAE Systems is the latest in a line of record-breaking solar aircraft making a -hour flight in and month-long flights were envisioned by From March to July Solar Impulse an electric aircraft successfully circumnavigated the globe It is a single-seat plane powered by solar cells and capable of taking off under its own power The design allows the aircraft to remain airborne for several days A solar balloon is a black balloon that is filled with ordinary air As sunlight shines on the balloon the air inside is heated and expands causing an upward buoyancy force much like an artificially heated hot air balloon Some solar balloons are large enough for human flight but usage is generally limited to the toy market as the surface-area to payload-weight ratio is relatively high Squad Solar vehicle Squad Solar The Squad Solar is a Neighborhood Electric Vehicle that has a solar roof and can be plugged into a normal volt outlet to be charged Fuel production Concentrated solar panels are getting a power boost Pacific Northwest National Laboratory PNNL will be testing a new concentrated solar power system one that can help natural gas power plants reduce their fuel usage by up to percent needs update Main articles Solar chemical Solar fuel and Artificial photosynthesis Solar chemical processes use solar energy to drive chemical reactions These processes offset energy that would otherwise come from a fossil fuel source and can also convert solar energy into storable and transportable fuels Solar induced chemical reactions can be divided into thermochemical or photochemical A variety of fuels can be produced by artificial photosynthesis The multielectron catalytic chemistry involved in making carbon-based fuels such as methanol from reduction of carbon dioxide is challenging a feasible alternative is hydrogen production from protons though use of water as the source of electrons as plants do requires mastering the multielectron oxidation of two water molecules to molecular oxygen Some have envisaged working solar fuel plants in coastal metropolitan areas by the splitting of seawater providing hydrogen to be run through adjacent fuel-cell electric power plants and the pure water by-product going directly into the municipal water system In addition chemical energy storage is another solution to solar energy storage Hydrogen production technologies have been a significant area of solar chemical research since the s Aside from electrolysis driven by photovoltaic or photochemical cells several thermochemical processes have also been explored One such route uses concentrators to split water into oxygen and hydrogen at high temperatures C or F Another approach uses the heat from solar concentrators to drive the steam reformation of natural gas thereby increasing the overall hydrogen yield compared to conventional reforming methods Thermochemical cycles characterized by the decomposition and regeneration of reactants present another avenue for hydrogen production The Solzinc process under development at the Weizmann Institute of Science uses a MW solar furnace to decompose zinc oxide ZnO at temperatures above C F This initial reaction produces pure zinc which can subsequently be reacted with water to produce hydrogen Energy storage methods Main articles Energy storage Seasonal thermal energy storage Phase change material Grid energy storage and Vehicle-to-grid Thermal energy storage The Andasol CSP plant uses tanks of molten salt to store solar energy Thermal mass systems can store solar energy in the form of heat at domestically useful temperatures for daily or interseasonal durations Thermal storage systems generally use readily available materials with high specific heat capacities such as water earth and stone Well-designed systems can lower peak demand shift time-of-use to off-peak hours and reduce overall heating and cooling requirements Phase change materials such as paraffin wax and Glauber s salt are another thermal storage medium These materials are inexpensive readily available and can deliver domestically useful temperatures approximately C or F The Dover House in Dover Massachusetts was the first to use a Glauber s salt heating system in Solar energy can also be stored at high temperatures using molten salts Salts are an effective storage medium because they are low-cost have a high specific heat capacity and can deliver heat at temperatures compatible with conventional power systems The Solar Two project used this method of energy storage allowing it to store terajoules kWh in its m storage tank with an annual storage efficiency of about Off-grid PV systems have traditionally used rechargeable batteries to store excess electricity With grid-tied systems excess electricity can be sent to the transmission grid while standard grid electricity can be used to meet shortfalls Net metering programs give household systems credit for any electricity they deliver to the grid This is handled by rolling back the meter whenever the home produces more electricity than it consumes If the net electricity use is below zero the utility then rolls over the kilowatt-hour credit to the next month Other approaches involve the use of two meters to measure electricity consumed vs electricity produced This is less common due to the increased installation cost of the second meter Most standard meters accurately measure in both directions making a second meter unnecessary Pumped-storage hydroelectricity stores energy in the form of water pumped when energy is available from a lower elevation reservoir to a higher elevation one The energy is recovered when demand is high by releasing the water with the pump becoming a hydroelectric power generator Development deployment and economics Participants in a workshop on sustainable development inspect solar panels at Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education Mexico City on top of a building on campus Further information Deployment of solar power to energy grids See also Cost of electricity by source and Renewable energy by country Cost development of solar PV modules per watt Beginning with the surge in coal use which accompanied the Industrial Revolution energy consumption steadily transitioned from wood and biomass to fossil fuels The early development of solar technologies starting in the s was driven by an expectation that coal would soon become scarce However development of solar technologies stagnated in the early th century in the face of the increasing availability economy and utility of coal and petroleum The oil embargo and energy crisis caused a reorganization of energy policies around the world It brought renewed attention to developing solar technologies Deployment strategies focused on incentive programs such as the Federal Photovoltaic Utilization Program in the US and the Sunshine Program in Japan Other efforts included the formation of research facilities in the US SERI now NREL Japan NEDO and Germany Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems ISE Commercial solar water heaters began appearing in the United States in the s These systems saw increasing use until the s but were gradually replaced by cheaper and more reliable heating fuels As with photovoltaics solar water heating attracted renewed attention as a result of the oil crises in the s but interest subsided in the s due to falling petroleum prices Development in the solar water heating sector progressed steadily throughout the s and annual growth rates have averaged since Although generally underestimated solar water heating and cooling is by far the most widely deployed solar technology with an estimated capacity of GW as of The International Energy Agency has said that solar energy can make considerable contributions to solving some of the most urgent problems the world now faces The development of affordable inexhaustible and clean solar energy technologies will have huge longer-term benefits It will increase countries energy security through reliance on an indigenous inexhaustible and mostly import-independent resource enhance sustainability reduce pollution lower the costs of mitigating climate change and keep fossil fuel prices lower than otherwise These advantages are global Hence the additional costs of the incentives for early deployment should be considered learning investments they must be wisely spent and need to be widely shared In a report by the International Energy Agency found that solar energy technologies such as photovoltaics solar hot water and concentrated solar power could provide a third of the world s energy by if politicians commit to limiting climate change and transitioning to renewable energy The energy from the Sun could play a key role in de-carbonizing the global economy alongside improvements in energy efficiency and imposing costs on greenhouse gas emitters The strength of solar is the incredible variety and flexibility of applications from small scale to big scale We have proved that after our stores of oil and coal are exhausted the human race can receive unlimited power from the rays of the Sun Frank Shuman The New York Times July In Lazard estimated the levelized cost of new build unsubsidized utility scale solar electricity at less than dollars per MWh and existing coal-fired power above that amount The report also said that new solar was also cheaper than new gas-fired power but not generally existing gas power Emerging technologies See also Thin-film solar cell Solar cell efficiencies of various cell technologies including both single-crystal and thin film technologies

purpose of electricity generation Thermoelectric or thermovoltaic devices convert a temperature difference between dissimilar materials into an electric current Floating solar arrays This section is an excerpt from Floating solar edit Floating photovoltaic on an irrigation pond Floating solar or floating photovoltaics FPV sometimes called floatovoltaics are solar panels mounted on a structure that floats The structures that hold the panels usually consist of plastic buoys and cables They are then placed on a body of water Typically these bodies of water are reservoirs quarry lakes irrigation canals or remediation and tailing ponds The systems can have advantages over photovoltaics PV on land Water surfaces may be less expensive than the cost of land and there are fewer rules and regulations for structures built on bodies of water not used for recreation Life cycle analysis indicates that foam-based FPV have some of the shortest energy payback times years and the lowest greenhouse gas emissions to energy ratio kg CO eq MWh in crystalline silicon solar photovoltaic technologies reported FPV can be used to generate electricity for any application as well as to make green hydrogen via electrolysis on the same water they are floating on Floating arrays can achieve higher efficiencies than PV panels on land because water cools the panels The panels can have a special coating to prevent rust or corrosion Floating SPV also provide shade slow evaporation and inhibit the growth of algae The market for this renewable energy technology has grown rapidly since The first plants with capacities of a few dozen kWp were built between and Installed power grew from GW in to GW in surpassing a prediction of GW by The World Bank estimated there are large bodies of water suitable for floating solar with a technical capacity of over GW if of their surfaces were covered with panels The U S has more floating solar potential than any other country in the world Bodies of water suitable for floating solar are well-distributed throughout the U S The southeast and southern U S plains states generally have reservoirs with the largest capacities Solar-assisted heat pump Main article Solar-assisted heat pump A heat pump is a device that provides heat energy from a source of heat to a destination called a heat sink Heat pumps are designed to move thermal energy opposite to the direction of spontaneous heat flow by absorbing heat from a cold space and releasing it to a warmer one A solar-assisted heat pump represents the integration of a heat pump and thermal solar panels in a single integrated system Typically these two technologies are used separately or only placing them in parallel to produce hot water In this system the solar thermal panel performs the function of the low temperature heat source and the heat produced is used to feed the heat pump s evaporator The goal of this system is to get high COP and then produce energy in a more efficient and less expensive way It is possible to use any type of solar thermal panel sheet and tubes roll-bond heat pipe thermal plates or hybrid mono polycrystalline thin film in combination with the heat pump The use of a hybrid panel is preferable because it allows covering a part of the electricity demand of the heat pump and reduces the power consumption and consequently the variable costs of the system Solar aircraft In Solar Impulse was the first solar-powered aircraft to complete a circumnavigation of the world See also Solar Impulse An electric aircraft is an aircraft that runs on electric motors rather than internal combustion engines with electricity coming from fuel cells solar cells ultracapacitors power beaming or batteries Currently flying manned electric aircraft are

sunlight into electricity For a broader range of human uses for sunlight see Solar energy For the unit of light from stars and galaxies see Solar luminosity For other uses see Solar Power Rooftop solar in Hong Kong The first three concentrated solar power CSP units of Spain s Solnova Solar Power Station in the foreground with the PS and PS solar power towers in the background Solar power also known as solar electricity is the conversion of energy from sunlight into electricity either directly using photovoltaics PV or indirectly using concentrated solar power Solar panels use the photovoltaic effect to convert light into an electric current Concentrated solar power systems use lenses or mirrors and solar tracking systems to focus a large area of sunlight to a hot spot often to drive a steam turbine Photovoltaics PV were initially solely used as a source of electricity for small and medium-sized applications from the calculator powered by a single solar cell to remote homes powered by an off-grid rooftop PV system Commercial concentrated solar power plants were first developed in the s Since then as the cost of solar panels has fallen grid-connected solar PV systems capacity and production has doubled about every three years Three-quarters of new generation capacity is solar with both millions of rooftop installations and gigawatt-scale photovoltaic power stations continuing to be built In solar power generated of global electricity and over of primary energy by the substitution method adding twice as much new electricity as coal Along with onshore wind power utility-scale solar is the source with the cheapest levelised cost of electricity for new installations in most countries China has about half the world s solar power Almost half the solar power installed in was mounted on rooftops Much more low-carbon power is needed for electrification and to limit climate change The International Energy Agency said in that more effort was needed for grid integration and the mitigation of policy regulation and financing challenges Nevertheless solar may greatly cut the cost of energy Solar is important for energy security Potential Part of a

transport Tram Rapid transit Personal rapid transit Category Renewable energy portal v t e Geography affects solar energy potential because some places are sunnier than others In particular areas that are closer to the equator generally receive more sunshine However solar panels that can follow the position of the Sun can significantly increase the solar energy potential in areas that are farther from the equator Daytime cloud cover can reduce the light available for solar cells Land availability also has a large effect on the available solar energy Technologies Solar power plants use one of two technologies Photovoltaic PV systems use solar panels either on rooftops or in ground-mounted solar farms converting sunlight directly into electric power Concentrated solar power CSP systems use mirrors or lenses to concentrate sunlight to extreme heat to make steam which drives a turbine to generate electricity Solar cells Main articles Photovoltaics and Solar cell Schematics of a grid-connected residential PV power system The photovoltaic effect in solar cells converts light into electric current The first solar cell was constructed by Charles Fritts in the s The German industrialist Ernst Werner von Siemens was among those who recognized the importance of this discovery In the German engineer Bruno Lange developed a photo cell using silver selenide in place of copper oxide although the prototype selenium cells converted less than of incident light into electricity Following the work of Russell Ohl in the s researchers Gerald Pearson Calvin Fuller and Daryl Chapin created the silicon solar cell in These early solar cells cost US watt and reached efficiencies of In Mohamed M Atalla developed the process of silicon surface passivation by thermal oxidation at Bell Labs The surface passivation process has since been critical to solar cell efficiency As of update over of the market is crystalline silicon The array of a photovoltaic system or PV system produces direct current DC power which fluctuates with the sunlight s intensity For practical use this usually requires conversion to alternating current AC through the use of inverters Multiple solar cells are connected inside panels Panels are wired together to form arrays then tied to an inverter which produces power at the desired voltage and for AC the desired frequency phase Many residential PV systems are connected to the grid when available especially in developed countries with large markets In these grid-connected PV systems energy storage is optional In certain applications such as satellites lighthouses or in developing countries batteries or additional power generators are often added as back-ups Such stand-alone power systems permit operations at night and at other times of limited sunlight In a vertical agrivoltaics system solar cells are oriented vertically on farmland to allow the land to both grow crops and generate renewable energy Other configurations include floating solar farms placing solar canopies over parking lots and rooftop solar Thin-film solar Main article Thin-film solar cell A thin-film solar cell is a second generation solar cell that is made by depositing one or more thin layers or thin film TF of photovoltaic material on a substrate such as glass plastic or metal Thin-film solar cells are commercially used in several technologies including cadmium telluride CdTe copper indium gallium diselenide CIGS and amorphous thin-film silicon a-Si TF-Si Perovskite solar cells This section is an excerpt from Perovskite solar cell edit A perovskite solar cell PSC is a type of solar cell that includes a perovskite-structured compound most commonly a hybrid organic inorganic lead or tin halide-based material as the light-harvesting active layer Perovskite materials such as methylammonium lead halides the all-inorganic cesium lead halide are cheap to produce and simple to manufacture Solar-cell efficiencies of laboratory-scale devices using these materials have increased from in to in in single-junction architectures and in silicon-based tandem cells to exceeding the maximum efficiency achieved in single-junction silicon solar cells Perovskite solar cells have therefore been the fastest-advancing solar technology as of update With the potential of achieving even higher efficiencies and very low production costs perovskite solar cells have become commercially attractive Core problems and research subjects include their long-term stability high sensitivity to moisture and toxicity if lead is used Managing toxic lead in PSCs is essential as exposure presents significant health risks including neurological disorders Because PSCs are an emerging technology lead toxicity remains a major hurdle to widespread adoption and commercialization Concentrated solar power A parabolic collector concentrates sunlight onto a tube in its focal point Main article Concentrated solar power Concentrated solar power CSP also called concentrated solar thermal uses lenses or mirrors and tracking systems to concentrate sunlight then uses the resulting heat to generate electricity from conventional steam-driven turbines As of update the levelized cost of electricity from CSP is over twice that of PV As of less than of solar power comes from CSP Hybrid systems Main article Hybrid power A hybrid system combines solar with energy storage or one or more other forms of generation Hydro wind and batteries are commonly combined with solar The combined generation may enable the system to vary power output with demand or at least smooth the solar power fluctuation There is much hydro worldwide and adding solar panels on or around existing hydro reservoirs is particularly useful because hydro is usually more flexible than wind and cheaper at scale than batteries and existing power lines can sometimes be used Development and deployment See also Growth of photovoltaics Timeline of solar cells Solar power by country and Concentrated solar power Deployment around the world Per capita solar power usage Share of energy from solar power Early days The early development of solar technologies starting in the s was driven by an expectation that coal would soon become scarce such as experiments by Augustin Mouchot Charles Fritts installed the world s first rooftop photovoltaic solar array using -efficient selenium cells on a New York City roof in However development of solar technologies stagnated in the early th century in the face of the increasing availability economy and utility of coal and petroleum Bell Telephone Laboratories s research used silicon wafers with a thin coating of boron The Bell Solar Battery was described as efficient with a square yard of the panels generating watts The first satellite with solar panels was launched in By the s solar panels were still too expensive for much other than satellites In it was estimated that only six private homes in all of North America were entirely heated or cooled by functional solar power systems However the oil embargo and energy crisis caused a reorganization of energy policies around the world and brought renewed attention to developing solar technologies Deployment strategies focused on incentive programs such as the Federal Photovoltaic Utilization Program in the US and the Sunshine Program in Japan Other efforts included the formation of research facilities in the United States SERI now NREL Japan NEDO and Germany Fraunhofer ISE Between and installations of photovoltaic systems grew rapidly In the United States President Jimmy Carter set a target of producing of U S energy from solar by the year but his successor Ronald Reagan removed the funding for research into renewables Falling oil prices in the early s moderated the growth of photovoltaics from to Yearly solar generation by continent Benefitting from favorable policies and declining costs of modules photovoltaic solar installation has grown consistently In China added of the world s new capacity The growth of solar PV on a semi-log scale since Electricity production by source Mid- s to In the mid- s development of both residential and commercial rooftop solar as well as utility-scale photovoltaic power stations began to accelerate again due to supply issues with oil and natural gas global warming concerns and the improving economics of PV relative to other energy technologies In the early s the adoption of feed-in tariffs a policy mechanism that gives renewables priority on the grid and defines a fixed price for the generated electricity led to a high level of investment security and to a soaring number of PV deployments in Europe s For several years worldwide growth of solar PV was driven by European deployment but it then shifted to Asia especially China and Japan and to a growing number of countries and regions all over the world Chinese manufacturers of solar equipment grew to be the largest Although concentrated solar power capacity grew more than tenfold it remained a tiny proportion of the total because the cost of utility-scale solar PV fell by between and while CSP costs only fell in the same timeframe s Despite the rising cost of materials such as polysilicon during the global energy crisis utility scale solar was still the least expensive energy source in many countries due to the rising costs of other energy sources such as natural gas In global solar generation capacity exceeded TW for the first time However fossil-fuel subsidies have slowed the growth of solar generation capacity Current status See also Solar cell research About half of installed capacity is utility scale Map of solar resources from World bank Forecasts Actual annual deployments of solar PV vs predictions by the IEA for the period Predictions have largely and consistently underestimated actual growth Solar is forecast to become the largest source of renewable power before the end of the s exceeding the output of hydropower Utility scale is forecast to become the largest source of electricity in all regions except sub-Saharan Africa by Photovoltaic power stations See also List of photovoltaic power stations This section is an excerpt from Photovoltaic power station edit The MW J nnersdorf Solar Park in Prignitz Germany A photovoltaic power station also known as a solar park solar farm or solar power plant is a large-scale grid-connected photovoltaic power system PV system designed for the supply of merchant power They are different from most building-mounted and other decentralized solar power because they supply power at the utility level rather than to a local user or users Utility-scale solar is sometimes used to describe this type of project This approach differs from concentrated solar power the other major large-scale solar generation technology which uses heat to drive a variety of conventional generator systems Both approaches have their own advantages and disadvantages but to date for a variety of reasons photovoltaic technology has seen much wider use As of update about of utility-scale solar power capacity was PV In some countries the nameplate capacity of photovoltaic power stations is rated in megawatt-peak MW p which refers to the solar array s theoretical maximum DC power output In other countries the manufacturer states the surface and the efficiency However Canada Japan Spain and the United States often specify using the converted lower nominal power output in MW AC a measure more directly comparable to other forms of power generation Most solar parks are developed at a scale of at least MW p As of the world s largest operating photovoltaic power stations surpassed gigawatt At the end of about solar farms were larger than MW AC utility scale with a combined capacity of over GW AC Most of the existing large-scale photovoltaic power stations are owned and operated by independent power producers but the involvement of community and utility-owned projects is increasing Previously almost all were supported at least in part by regulatory incentives such as feed-in tariffs or tax credits but as levelized costs fell significantly in the s and grid parity has been reached in most markets external incentives are usually not needed Concentrating solar power stations Main article List of solar thermal power stations Ivanpah Solar Electric Generating System with all three towers under load Part of the MW Solar Energy Generating Systems SEGS parabolic trough solar complex in northern San Bernardino County California Commercial concentrating solar power CSP plants also called solar thermal power stations were first developed in the s The MW Ivanpah Solar Power Facility located in California s Mojave Desert is the world s largest solar thermal power plant project Other large CSP plants include the Solnova Solar Power Station MW the Andasol solar power station MW and Extresol Solar Power Station MW all in Spain The principal advantage of CSP is the ability to efficiently add thermal storage allowing the dispatching of electricity over up to a -hour period Since peak electricity demand typically occurs at about pm many CSP power plants use to hours of thermal storage Economics See also Photovoltaic power station Economics and finance Cost per watt See also Cost of electricity by source In many countries solar power is the lowest cost source of electricity The typical cost factors for solar power include the costs of the modules the frame to hold them wiring inverters labour cost any land that might be required the grid connection maintenance and the solar insolation that location will receive Photovoltaic systems use no fuel and modules typically last to years Thus upfront capital and financing costs make up to of the cost of solar power which is a problem for countries where contracts may not be honoured such as some African countries Some countries are considering price caps whereas others prefer contracts for difference Installation prices Expenses of high-power band solar modules has greatly decreased over time Beginning in the cost per kW was approximately American dollars and in the cost dropped to approximately American dollars per kW The PV system in cost approximately American dollars per kW and it dropped to approximately American dollars per kW in In in the US residential solar costs around dollars watt but solar shingles cost much more As of update utility solar costs are around UScent watt Productivity by location See also Solar irradiance The productivity of solar power in a region depends on solar irradiance which varies through the day and year and is influenced by latitude and climate PV system output power also depends on ambient temperature wind speed solar spectrum the local soiling conditions and other factors Onshore wind power tends to be the cheapest source of electricity in Northern Eurasia Canada some parts of the United States and Patagonia in Argentina whereas in other parts of the world mostly solar power or less often a combination of wind solar and other low carbon energy is thought to be best Modelling by Exeter University suggests that by solar will be least expensive everywhere except in some nordic countries The locations with highest annual solar irradiance lie in the arid tropics and subtropics Deserts lying in low latitudes usually have few clouds and can receive sunshine for more than ten hours a day These hot deserts form the Global Sun Belt circling the world This belt consists of extensive swathes of land in Northern Africa Southern Africa Southwest Asia Middle East and Australia as well as the much smaller deserts of North and South America Thus solar is or is predicted to become the cheapest source of energy in all of Central America Africa the Middle East India South-east Asia Australia and several other regions Different measurements of solar irradiance direct normal irradiance global horizontal irradiance are mapped below North America South America Europe Africa and Middle East South and South-East Asia Australia World Self-consumption In cases of self-consumption of solar energy the payback time is calculated based on how much electricity is not purchased from the grid However in many cases the patterns of generation and consumption do not coincide and some or all of the energy is fed back into the grid The electricity is sold and at other times when energy is taken from the grid electricity is bought The relative costs and prices obtained affect the economics In many markets the price paid for sold PV electricity is significantly lower than the price of bought electricity which incentivizes self-consumption Moreover separate self-consumption incentives have been used in e g Germany and Italy Grid interaction regulation has also included limitations of grid feed-in in some regions in Germany with high amounts of installed PV capacity By increasing self-consumption the grid feed-in can be limited without curtailment which wastes electricity A good match between generation and consumption is key for high self-consumption The match can be improved with batteries or controllable electricity consumption However batteries are expensive and profitability may require the provision of other services from them besides self-consumption increase for example avoiding power outages Hot water storage tanks with electric heating with heat pumps or resistance heaters can provide low-cost storage for self-consumption of solar power Shiftable loads such as dishwashers tumble dryers and washing machines can provide controllable consumption with only a limited effect on the users but their effect on self-consumption of solar power may be limited Energy pricing incentives and taxes Main article PV financial incentives The original political purpose of incentive policies for PV was to facilitate an initial small-scale deployment to begin to grow the industry even where the cost of PV was significantly above grid parity to allow the industry to achieve the economies of scale necessary to reach grid parity Since reaching grid parity some policies are implemented to promote national energy independence high tech job creation and reduction of CO emissions Net metering Net metering is a pricing method for residential solar the price of the electricity produced is the same as the price supplied to the consumer and the consumer is billed on the difference between production and consumption Community solar Community solar farm in the town of Wheatland Wisconsin A community solar project is a solar power installation that accepts capital from and provides output credit and tax benefits to multiple customers including individuals businesses nonprofits and other investors Participants typically invest in or subscribe to a certain kW capacity or kWh generation of remote electrical production Taxes In some countries tariffs import taxes are imposed on imported solar panels Grid integration Main articles Energy storage and Grid energy storage Energy from sunlight or other renewable energy is converted to potential energy for storage in devices such as electric batteries or higher-elevation water reservoirs The stored potential energy is later converted to electricity that is added to the power grid even when the original energy source is not available Salt Tanks provide thermal energy storage so that output can be provided after sunset and output can be scheduled to meet demand requirements The MW Solana Generating Station is designed to provide six hours of energy storage This allows the plant to generate about of its rated capacity over the course of a year Thermal energy storage The Andasol CSP plant uses tanks of molten salt to store solar energy Pumped-storage hydroelectricity PSH This facility in Geesthacht Germany also includes a solar array Variability The overwhelming majority of electricity produced worldwide is used immediately because traditional generators can adapt to demand and storage is usually more expensive Both solar power and wind power are sources of variable renewable power meaning that all available output must be used locally carried on transmission lines to be used elsewhere or stored e g in a battery Since solar energy is not available at night storing it so as to have continuous electricity availability is potentially an important issue particularly in off-grid applications and for future renewable energy scenarios Solar is intermittent due to the day night cycles and variable weather conditions However solar power can be forecast somewhat by time of day location and seasons The challenge of integrating solar power in any given electric utility varies significantly In places with hot summers and mild winters solar tends to be well matched to daytime cooling demands Energy storage Concentrated solar power plants may use thermal storage to store solar energy such as in high-temperature molten salts These salts are an effective storage medium because they are low-cost have a high specific heat capacity and can deliver heat at temperatures compatible with conventional power systems In stand alone PV systems batteries are traditionally used to store excess electricity With grid-connected photovoltaic power systems excess electricity can be sent to the electrical grid Net metering and feed-in tariff programs give these systems a credit for the electricity they produce This credit offsets electricity provided from the grid when the system cannot meet demand effectively trading with the grid instead of storing excess electricity When wind and solar are a small fraction of the grid power other generation techniques can adjust their output appropriately but as these forms of variable power grow additional balance on the grid is needed As prices are rapidly declining PV systems increasingly use rechargeable batteries to store a surplus to be used later at night Batteries used for grid-storage stabilize electrical grids by leveling out peak loads for several hours Common battery technologies used in today s home PV systems include nickel-cadmium lead-acid nickel metal hydride and lithium-ion better source needed Lithium-ion batteries have the potential to replace lead-acid batteries in the near future as they are being intensively developed and lower prices are expected due to economies of scale provided by large production facilities such as the Tesla Gigafactory In addition the Li-ion batteries of plug-in electric cars may serve as future storage devices in a vehicle-to-grid system Since most vehicles are parked an average of of the time their batteries could be used to let electricity flow from the car to the power lines and back Retired electric vehicle EV batteries can be repurposed Other rechargeable batteries used for distributed PV systems include sodium sulfur and vanadium redox batteries two prominent types of a molten salt and a flow battery respectively Seasonal cycle of capacity factors for wind and photovoltaics in Europe shown under idealized assumptions The figure illustrates the balancing effects of wind and solar energy at the seasonal scale Kaspar et al Other technologies Solar power plants while they can be curtailed usually simply output as much power as possible Therefore in an electricity system without sufficient grid energy storage generation from other sources coal biomass natural gas nuclear hydroelectricity generally go up and down in reaction to the rise and fall of solar electricity and variations in demand see load following power plant Conventional hydroelectric dams work very well in conjunction with solar power water can be held back or released from a reservoir as required Where suitable geography is not available pumped-storage hydroelectricity can use solar power to pump water to a high reservoir on sunny days then the energy is recovered at night and in bad weather by releasing water via a hydroelectric plant to a low reservoir where the cycle can begin again While hydroelectric and natural gas plants can quickly respond to changes in load coal biomass and nuclear plants usually take considerable time to respond to load and can only be scheduled to follow the predictable variation Depending on local circumstances beyond about of total generation grid-connected intermittent sources like solar tend to require investment in some combination of grid interconnections energy storage or demand side management In countries with high solar generation such as Australia electricity prices may become negative in the middle of the day when solar generation is high thus incentivizing new battery storage The combination of wind and solar PV has the advantage that the two sources complement each other because the peak operating times for each system occur at different times of the day and year The power generation of such solar hybrid power systems is therefore more constant and fluctuates less than each of the two component subsystems Solar power is seasonal particularly in northern southern climates away from the equator suggesting a need for long term seasonal storage in a medium such as hydrogen or pumped hydroelectric Environmental effects Further information Concentrated solar power Environmental effects Greenhouse gas emissions per energy source Solar power is one of the sources with the least greenhouse gas emissions Part of the Senftenberg Solarpark a solar photovoltaic power plant located on former open-pit mining areas close to the city of Senftenberg in Eastern Germany The MW Phase of the plant was completed within three months Solar power is cleaner than electricity from fossil fuels and is better for the environment than burning things Solar power does not lead to harmful emissions during operation but the production of the panels creates some pollution The carbon footprint of manufacturing is less than kg CO Wp and this is expected to fall as manufacturers use more clean electricity and recycled materials Solar power carries an upfront cost to the environment via production with a carbon payback time of several years as of update but offers clean energy for the remainder of their -year lifetime The life-cycle greenhouse-gas emissions of solar farms are less than gram g per kilowatt-hour kWh but with battery storage could be up to g kWh In contrast a combined cycle gas-fired power plant without carbon capture and storage emits around g kWh and a coal-fired power plant about g kWh Similar to all energy sources where their total life cycle emissions are mostly from construction the switch to low carbon power in the manufacturing and transportation of solar devices would further reduce carbon emissions Lifecycle surface power density of solar power varies but averages about W m compared to about for nuclear power and for gas However when the land required for gas extraction and processing is accounted for gas power is estimated to have not much higher power density than solar According to a study obtaining to of electricity from solar farms in their own territory by would require the panels to cover land ranging from to of the European Union to in India and to in Japan and South Korea Occupation of such large areas for PV farms could drive residential opposition as well as lead to deforestation removal of vegetation and conversion of farm land However some countries such as South Korea and Japan use land for agriculture under PV or floating solar together with other low-carbon power sources Worldwide land use has minimal ecological impact Land use can be reduced to the level of gas power by installing on buildings and other built up areas Harmful materials are used in the production of solar panels but generally in small amounts As of update the environmental impact of perovskite is difficult to estimate but there is some concern that lead may be a problem A International Energy Agency study projects the demand for copper will double by The study cautions that supply needs to increase rapidly to match demand from large-scale deployment of solar and required grid upgrades More tellurium and indium may also be needed Recycling may help As solar panels are sometimes replaced with more efficient panels the second-hand panels are sometimes reused in developing countries for example in Africa Several countries have specific regulations for the recycling of solar panels Although maintenance cost is already low compared to other energy sources some academics have called for solar power systems to be designed to be more repairable Solar panels can increase local temperature In large installation in the desert the effect can be stronger than the urban heat island A very small proportion of solar power is concentrated solar power Concentrated solar power may use much more water than gas-fired power This can be a problem as this type of solar power needs strong sunlight so is often built in deserts Politics Acceptance of wind and solar facilities in one s community is stronger among U S Democrats blue while acceptance of nuclear power plants is stronger among U S Republicans red It has been argued that although the economic benefits of the energy transition to solar and other clean energy are so great that it cannot be stopped slowing it would result in more climate damage The fossil fuels lobby has been accused of delaying the transition Fossil fuel subsidies are political and impede the transition Solar generation cannot be cut off by geopolitics once installed unlike oil and gas which contributes to energy security And libertarians may favor it for reducing dependence on government and reliance on inadequate electricity grids However some right wing parties are opposed to or split on solar Far right party positions vary by country with some opposing utility solar as part of their climate change denial Although Green parties may favor solar as part of climate change mitigation some environmentalists oppose new power lines As of update over of global polysilicon manufacturing capacity is in Xinjiang in China which raises concerns about human rights violations Xinjiang internment camps According to the International Solar Energy Society China s dominance of manufacturing is not a problem both because they estimate solar manufacturing cannot grow to more than b USD per year and because if Chinese supply was cut off other countries would have years to create their own industry Businesses may lobby government for or against tariffs on panel imports See also renewable energy Cost of electricity by source Gravity battery

Marine energy Ocean thermal Osmotic power Solar energy Solar power Sustainable biofuel Tidal power Tidal stream generator Wave power Wind power Nuclear power proposed as renewable energy Topics by country and territory Marketing and policy trends v t e Sustainable biofuel refers to biofuels produced in ways that minimise environmental and social impacts while providing a renewable alternative to fossil fuels Unlike conventional biofuels which may compete with food production or contribute to deforestation sustainable biofuels are derived from feedstocks and processes designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions protect biodiversity and support long-term resource availability Examples include fuels made from non-food crops agricultural and forestry residues algae and waste materials International initiatives such as the Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials have developed standards and certification schemes to assess sustainability across the biofuel supply chain The concept is closely linked to broader debates on energy security climate change mitigation and the transition to low-carbon economies Sustainability standards edit See also Low-carbon fuel standard In the Roundtable for Sustainable Biofuels released its proposed standards for sustainable biofuels This includes principles Biofuel production shall follow international treaties and national laws regarding such things as air quality water resources agricultural practices labor conditions and more Biofuels projects shall be designed and operated in participatory processes that involve all relevant stakeholders in planning and monitoring Biofuels shall significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions as compared to fossil fuels The principle seeks to establish a standard methodology for comparing greenhouse gases GHG benefits Biofuel production shall not violate human rights or labor rights and shall ensure decent work and the well-being of workers Biofuel production shall contribute to the social and economic development of local rural and indigenous peoples and communities Biofuel production shall not impair food security Biofuel production shall avoid negative impacts on biodiversity ecosystems and areas of high conservation value Biofuel production shall promote practices that improve soil health and minimize degradation Surface and groundwater use will be optimized and contamination or depletion of water resources minimized Air pollution shall be minimized along the supply chain Biofuels shall be produced in the most cost-effective way with a commitment to improve production efficiency and social and environmental performance in all stages of the biofuel value chain Biofuel production shall not violate land rights Several countries and regions have introduced policies or adopted standards to promote sustainable biofuels production and use most prominently the European Union and the United States The EU Renewable Energy Directive which requires percent of transportation energy from renewable energy by is the most comprehensive mandatory sustainability standard in place as of The EU Renewable Energy Directive requires that the lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions of biofuels consumed be at least percent less than the equivalent emissions from gasoline or diesel by and percent less starting in Also the feedstocks for biofuels should not be harvested from lands with high biodiversity value from carbon-rich or forested land or from wetlands As with the EU the U S Renewable Fuel Standard RFS and the California Low Carbon Fuel Standard LCFS both require specific levels of lifecycle greenhouse gas reductions compared to equivalent fossil fuel consumption The RFS requires that at least half of the biofuels production mandated by should reduce lifecycle emissions by percent The LCFS is a performance standard that calls for a minimum of percent emissions reduction per unit of transport energy by Both the U S and California standards currently address only greenhouse gas emissions but California plans to expand its policy to address other sustainability issues associated with liquid biofuels in the future In Brazil also adopted new sustainability policies for sugarcane ethanol including zoning regulation of sugarcane expansion and social protocols Motivation edit Biofuels in the form of liquid fuels derived from plant materials are entering the market driven by factors such as oil price spikes and the need for increased energy security Many of these first-generation biofuels that are currently being supplied have been criticised for their adverse impacts on the natural environment food security and land use The challenge is to support second third and fourth-generation biofuel development Second-generation biofuels include new cellulosic technologies with responsible policies and economic instruments to help ensure that biofuel commercialization is sustainable Responsible commercialization of biofuels represents an opportunity to enhance sustainable economic prospects in Africa Latin America and Asia Biofuels have a limited ability to replace fossil fuels and should not be regarded as a silver bullet to deal with transport emissions They offer a prospect of increased market competition and oil price moderation A healthy supply of alternative energy sources will help to combat gasoline price spikes and reduce dependency on fossil fuels especially in the transport sector Using transportation fuels more efficiently is also an integral part of a sustainable transport strategy Options edit Biofuel development and use is a complex issue because there are many biofuel options which are available Biofuels such as ethanol and biodiesel are currently produced from the products of conventional food crops such as the starch sugar and oil feedstocks from crops that include wheat maize sugar cane palm oil and oilseed rape Some researchers fear that a major switch to biofuels from such crops would create a direct competition with their use for food and animal feed and claim that in some parts of the world the economic consequences are already visible other researchers look at the land available and the enormous areas of idle and abandoned land and claim that there is room for a large proportion of biofuel also from conventional crops Second generation biofuels are now being produced from a much broader range of feedstocks including the cellulose in dedicated energy crops perennial grasses such as switchgrass and Miscanthus giganteus forestry materials the co-products from food production and domestic vegetable waste Advances in the conversion processes will improve the sustainability of biofuels through better efficiencies and reduced environmental impact of producing biofuels from both existing food crops and from cellulosic sources One promising development in biobutanol production technology was discovered in the late summer of Tulane University s alternative fuel research scientists discovered a strain of Clostridium bacteria called TU- a key feature of the discovery is that the TU- organism can convert nearly any form of cellulose into butanol and is the only known strain of Clostridium -genus bacteria that can do so in the presence of oxygen The university s researchers have stated that the source of the TU- Clostridium bacteria strain was most likely from the solid waste from one of the plains zebra at New Orleans Audubon Zoo In Ronald Oxburgh suggested in The Courier-Mail that production of biofuels could be either responsible or irresponsible and had several trade-offs Produced responsibly they are a sustainable energy source that need not divert any land from growing food nor damage the environment they can also help solve the problems of the waste generated by Western society and they can create jobs for the poor where previously were none Produced irresponsibly they at best offer no climate benefit and at worst have detrimental social and environmental consequences In other words biofuels are pretty much like any other product In the Nobel prize-winning chemist Paul J Crutzen published findings that the release of nitrous oxide N O emissions in the production of biofuels means that they contribute more to global warming than the fossil fuels they replace According to the Rocky Mountain Institute sound biofuel production practices would not hamper food and fibre production nor cause water or environmental problems and would enhance soil fertility The selection of land on which to grow the feedstocks is a critical component of the ability of biofuels to deliver sustainable solutions A key consideration is the minimisation of biofuel competition for prime cropland Biofuels are different from fossil fuels in regard to carbon emissions being short term but are similar to fossil fuels in that biofuels contribute to air pollution Raw biofuels burned to generate steam for heat and power produces airborne carbon particulates carbon monoxide and nitrous oxides The WHO estimates million premature deaths worldwide in due to air pollution Ingredients edit Sugarcane in Brazil edit Sugarcane Saccharum officinarum plantation ready for harvest Ituverava S o Paulo State Brazil Mechanized harvesting of sugarcane Piracicaba S o Paulo Brazil Cosan s Costa Pinto sugar cane mill and ethanol distillery plant at Piracicaba S o Paulo Brazil See also Environmental and social impacts of Brazilian ethanol fuel Brazil s production of ethanol fuel from sugarcane dates back to the s as a governmental response to the oil crisis Brazil is considered the biofuel industry leader and the world s first sustainable biofuels economy In the U S Environmental Protection Agency designated Brazilian sugarcane ethanol as an advanced biofuel due to EPA s estimated reduction of total life cycle greenhouse gas emissions including direct indirect land use change emissions Brazil sugarcane ethanol fuel program success and sustainability is based on the most efficient agricultural technology for sugarcane cultivation in the world uses modern equipment and cheap sugar cane as feedstock the residual cane-waste bagasse is used to process heat and power which results in a very competitive price and also in a high energy balance output energy input energy which varies from for average conditions to for best practice production A report commissioned by the United Nations based on a detailed review of published research up to mid- as well as the input of independent experts world-wide found that ethanol from sugar cane as produced in Brazil in some circumstances does better than just zero emission If grown and processed correctly it has negative emission pulling CO out of the atmosphere rather than adding it In contrast the report found that U S use of maize for biofuel is less efficient as sugarcane can lead to emissions reductions of between and well over when substituted for gasoline Several other studies have shown that sugarcane-based ethanol reduces greenhouse gases by to if there is no significant land use change In another study commissioned by the Dutch government in to evaluate the sustainability of Brazilian bioethanol concluded that there is sufficient water to supply all foreseeable long-term water requirements for sugarcane and ethanol production This evaluation also found that consumption of agrochemicals for sugar cane production is lower than in citric corn coffee and soybean cropping The study found that development of resistant sugar cane varieties is a crucial aspect of disease and pest control and is one of the primary objectives of Brazil s cane genetic improvement programs Disease control is one of the main reasons for the replacement of a commercial variety of sugar cane Another concern is the fact that sugarcane fields are traditionally burned just before harvest to avoid harm to the workers by removing the sharp leaves and killing snakes and other harmful animals and also to fertilize the fields with ash Mechanization will reduce pollution from burning fields and has higher productivity than people and due to mechanization the number of temporary workers in the sugarcane plantations has already declined By the harvest season around of the cane was collected with harvesting machines Regarding the negative impacts of the potential direct and indirect effect of land use changes on carbon emissions the study commissioned by the Dutch government concluded that it is very difficult to determine the indirect effects of further land use for sugar cane production i e sugar cane replacing another crop like soy or citrus crops which in turn causes additional soy plantations replacing pastures which in turn may cause deforestation and also not logical to attribute all these soil carbon losses to sugar cane The Brazilian agency Embrapa estimates that there is enough agricultural land available to increase at least times the existing sugarcane plantation without endangering sensible ecosystems or taking land destined for food crops Most future growth is expected to take place on abandoned pasture lands as it has been the historical trend in S o Paulo state Also productivity is expected to improve even further based on current biotechnology research genetic improvement and better agronomic practices thus contributing to reduce land demand for future sugarcane cultures Location of environmentally valuable areas with respect to sugarcane plantations S o Paulo located in the Southeast Region of Brazil concentrates two-thirds of sugarcane cultures Another concern is the risk of clearing rain forests and other environmentally valuable land for sugarcane production such as the Amazon rainforest the Pantanal or the Cerrado Embrapa has rebutted this concern explaining that of sugarcane plantations are located at least km from the Amazon and expansion during the last years took place in the Center-South region also far away from the Amazon rainforest the Pantanal or the Atlantic forest In S o Paulo state growth took place in abandoned pasture lands The impact assessment commissioned by the Dutch government supported this argument In order to guarantee a sustainable development of ethanol production in September the government issued by decree a countrywide agroecological land use zoning to restrict sugarcane growth in or near environmentally sensitive areas According to the new criteria of the Brazilian territory is not suitable for sugarcane plantation The government considers that the suitable areas are more than enough to meet the future demand for ethanol and sugar in the domestic and international markets foreseen for the next decades Regarding the food vs fuel issue a World Bank research report published in July found that Brazil s sugar-based ethanol did not push food prices appreciably higher This research paper also concluded that Brazil s sugar cane based ethanol has not raised sugar prices significantly An economic assessment report also published in July by the OECD agrees with the World Bank report regarding the negative effects of subsidies and trade restrictions but found that the impact of biofuels on food prices are much smaller A study by the Brazilian research unit of the Funda o Get lio Vargas regarding the effects of biofuels on grain prices concluded that the major driver behind the rise in food prices was speculative activity on futures markets under conditions of increased demand in a market with low grain stocks The study also concluded that there is no correlation between Brazilian sugarcane cultivated area and average grain prices as on the contrary the spread of sugarcane was accompanied by rapid growth of grain crops in the country Jatropha edit India and Africa edit Jatropha gossipifolia in Hyderabad India Crops like Jatropha used for biodiesel can thrive on marginal agricultural land where many trees and crops won t grow or would produce only slow growth yields Jatropha cultivation provides benefits for local communities Cultivation and fruit picking by hand is labour-intensive and needs around one person per hectare In parts of rural India and Africa this provides much-needed jobs about people worldwide now find employment through jatropha Moreover villagers often find that they can grow other crops in the shade of the trees Their communities will avoid importing expensive diesel and there will be some for export too Cambodia edit Cambodia has no proven fossil fuel reserves and is almost completely dependent on imported diesel fuel for electricity production Consequently Cambodians face an insecure supply and pay some of the highest energy prices in the world The impacts of this are widespread and may hinder economic development Biofuels may provide a substitute for diesel fuel that can be manufactured locally for a lower price independent of the international oil price The local production and use of biofuel also offers other benefits such as improved energy security rural development opportunities and environmental benefits The Jatropha curcas species appears to be a particularly suitable source of biofuel as it already grows commonly in Cambodia Local sustainable production of biofuel in Cambodia based on the Jatropha or other sources offers good potential benefits for the investors the economy rural communities and the environment Mexico edit Jatropha is native to Mexico and Central America and was likely transported to India and Africa in the s by Portuguese sailors convinced it had medicinal uses In recognizing the need to diversify its sources of energy and reduce emissions Mexico passed a law to push developing biofuels that don t threaten food security and the agriculture ministry has since identified some million hectares million acres of land with a high potential to produce jatropha The Yucat n Peninsula for instance in addition to being a corn-producing region also contains abandoned sisal plantations where the growing of Jatropha for biodiesel production would not displace food On April Interjet completed the first Mexican aviation biofuels test flight on an Airbus A The fuel was a traditional jet fuel biojet blend produced from Jatropha oil provided by three Mexican producers Global Energ as Renovables a wholly owned subsidiary of U S -based Global Clean Energy Holdings Bencafser S A and Energy JH S A Honeywell s UOP processed the oil into Bio-SPK Synthetic Paraffinic Kerosene Global Energ as Renovables operates the largest Jatropha farm in the Americas On August Aeromexico Boeing and the Mexican Government participated in the first biojet powered transcontinental flight in aviation history The flight from Mexico City to Madrid used a blend of percent traditional fuel and percent biofuel aviation biofuel The biojet was produced entirely from Jatropha oil Pongamia Pinnata in Australia and India edit Pongamia pinnata seeds in Brisbane Australia Pongamia pinnata is a legume native to Australia India Florida USA and most tropical regions and is now being invested in as an alternative to Jatropha for areas such as Northern Australia where Jatropha is classed as a noxious weed Commonly known as simply Pongamia this tree is currently being commercialised in Australia by Pacific Renewable Energy for use as a Diesel replacement for running in modified Diesel engines or for conversion to Biodiesel using st or nd Generation Biodiesel techniques for running in unmodified Diesel engines Sweet sorghum in India edit Sweet sorghum overcomes many of the shortcomings of other biofuel crops With sweet sorghum only the stalks are used for biofuel production while the grain is saved for food or livestock feed It is not in high demand in the global food market and thus has little impact on food prices and food security Sweet sorghum is grown on already-farmed drylands that are low in carbon storage capacity so concerns about the clearing of rainforest do not apply Sweet sorghum is easier and cheaper to grow than other biofuel crops in India and does not require irrigation an important consideration in dry areas Some of the Indian sweet sorghum varieties are now grown in Uganda for ethanol production A study by researchers at the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics ICRISAT found that growing sweet sorghum instead of grain sorghum could increase farmers incomes by US per hectare per crop because it can provide food feed and fuel With grain sorghum currently grown on over million hectares ha in Asia and on million ha in Africa a switch to sweet sorghum could have a considerable economic impact International collaboration edit Roundtable on Sustainable Materials edit Public attitudes and the actions of key stakeholders can play a crucial role in realising the potential of sustainable biofuels Informed discussion and dialogue based both on scientific research and an understanding of public and stakeholder views is important The Roundtable on Sustainable Materials previously Roundtable on Sustainable Biofuels is an international initiative which brings together farmers companies governments non-governmental organizations and scientists who are interested in the sustainability of biofuels production and distribution During the Roundtable used meetings teleconferences and online discussions to develop a series of principles and criteria for sustainable biofuels production In April the Roundtable on Sustainable Biofuels launched a set of comprehensive sustainability criteria the RSB Certification System Biofuels producers that meet to these criteria are able to show buyers and regulators that their product has been obtained without harming the environment or violating human rights Sustainable Biofuels Consensus edit The Sustainable Biofuels Consensus is an international initiative which calls upon governments the private sector and other stakeholders to take decisive action to ensure the sustainable trade production and use of biofuels In this way biofuels may play a key role in energy sector transformation climate stabilization and resulting worldwide revitalisation of rural areas The Sustainable Biofuels Consensus envisions a landscape that provides food fodder fiber and energy which offers opportunities for rural development that diversifies energy supply restores ecosystems protects biodiversity and sequesters carbon Better Sugarcane Initiative Bonsucro edit See also Bonsucro In a multi-stakeholder process was initiated by the World Wildlife Fund and the International Finance Corporation the private development arm of the World Bank bringing together industry supply chain intermediaries end-users farmers and civil society organisations to develop standards for certifying the derivative products of sugar cane one of which is ethanol fuel The Bonsucro standard is based around a definition of sustainability which is founded on five principles Obey the law Respect human rights and labour standards Manage input production and processing efficiencies to enhance sustainability Actively manage biodiversity and ecosystem services Continuously improve key areas of the business Biofuel producers that wish to sell products marked with the Bonsucro standard must both ensure that they produce to the Production Standard and that their downstream buyers meet the Chain of Custody Standard In addition if they wish to sell to the European market and count against the EU Renewable Energy Directive then they must adhere to the Bonsucro EU standard which includes specific greenhouse gas calculations following European Commission calculation guidelines Oil price moderation edit Biofuels offer the prospect of real market competition and oil price moderation According to The Wall Street Journal crude oil would be trading per cent higher and gasoline would be as much as per cent more expensive if it were not for biofuels A healthy supply of alternative energy sources will help to combat gasoline price spikes Sustainable transport edit See also BioEthanol for Sustainable Transport Biofuels have a limited ability to replace fossil fuels and should not be regarded as a silver bullet to deal with transport emissions Biofuels on their own cannot deliver a sustainable transport system and so must be developed as part of an integrated approach which promotes other renewable energy options and energy efficiency as well as reducing the overall energy demand and need for transport Consideration needs to be given to the development of hybrid and fuel cell vehicles public transport and better town and rural planning In December an Air New Zealand jet completed the world s first commercial aviation test flight partially using jatropha-based fuel More than a dozen performance tests were undertaken in the two-hour test flight which departed from Auckland International Airport A biofuel blend of jatropha and Jet A fuel was used to power one of the Boeing - s Rolls-Royce RB engines Air New Zealand set several criteria for its jatropha requiring that the land it came from was neither forest nor virgin grassland in the previous years that the soil and climate it came from is not suitable for the majority of food crops and that the farms are rain fed and not mechanically irrigated The company has also set general sustainability criteria saying that such biofuels must not compete with food resources that they must be as good as traditional jet fuels and that they should be cost competitive As of August update published assessments placed delivered sustainable aviation fuel SAF in the range of about US per U S gallon in international markets with U S spot quotes sometimes higher incentives can lower the airline s effective net price In January Continental Airlines used a sustainable biofuel to power a commercial aircraft for the first time in North America This demonstration flight marks the first sustainable biofuel demonstration flight by a commercial carrier using a twin-engined aircraft a Boeing - powered by CFM International CFM - B engines The biofuel blend included components derived from algae and jatropha plants The algae oil was provided by Sapphire Energy and the jatropha oil by Terasol Energy In March Yale University research showed significant potential for sustainable aviation fuel based on jatropha-curcas According to the research if cultivated properly jatropha can deliver many benefits in Latin America and greenhouse gas reductions of up to percent when compared to petroleum-based jet fuel Actual farming conditions in Latin America were assessed using sustainability criteria developed by the Roundtable on Sustainable Biofuels Unlike previous research which used theoretical inputs the Yale team conducted many interviews with jatropha farmers and used field measurements to develop the first comprehensive sustainability analysis of actual projects As of June revised international aviation fuel standards officially allow commercial airlines to blend conventional jet fuel with up to percent biofuels The renewable fuels can be blended with conventional commercial and military jet fuel through requirements in the newly issued edition of ASTM D Specification for Aviation Turbine Fuel Containing Synthesized Hydrocarbons In December the FAA awarded million to eight companies to advance the development of commercial aviation biofuels with a special focus on alcohol to jet fuel The FAA is assisting in the development of a sustainable fuel from alcohols sugars biomass and organic matter such as pyrolysis oils that can be dropped in to aircraft without changing current practices and infrastructure The research will test how the new fuels affect engine durability and quality control standards GreenSky London a biofuels plant under construction in aimed to take in some tonnes of municipal rubbish and change the organic component into tonnes of jet fuel and megawatts of power By the end of it was hoped all British Airways flights from London City Airport would be fuelled by waste and rubbish discarded by London residents leading to carbon savings equivalent to taking cars off the road The m scheme was mothballed in January

transport Tram Rapid transit Personal rapid transit Category Renewable energy portal v t e Tidal power or tidal energy is harnessed by converting energy from tides into useful forms of power mainly electricity using various methods Although not yet widely used tidal energy has the potential for future electricity generation Tides are more predictable than the wind and the sun Among sources of renewable energy tidal energy has traditionally suffered from relatively high cost and limited availability of sites with sufficiently high tidal ranges or flow velocities thus constricting its total availability However many recent technological developments and improvements both in design e g dynamic tidal power tidal lagoons and turbine technology e g new axial turbines cross flow turbines indicate that the total availability of tidal power may be much higher than previously assumed and that economic and environmental costs may be brought down to competitive levels Historically tide mills have been used both in Europe and on the Atlantic coast of North America Incoming water was contained in large storage ponds and as the tide goes out it turns waterwheels that use the mechanical power to mill grain The earliest occurrences date from the Middle Ages or even from Roman times The process of using falling water and spinning turbines to create electricity was introduced in the U S and Europe in the th century Electricity generation from marine technologies increased an estimated in and an estimated in Policies promoting R D are needed to achieve further cost reductions and large-scale development The world s first large-scale tidal power plant was France s Rance Tidal Power Station which became operational in It was the largest tidal power station in terms of output until Sihwa Lake Tidal Power Station opened in South Korea in August The Sihwa station uses sea wall defense barriers complete with turbines generating MW Principle edit Variation of tides over a day Main articles Tide and Tidal acceleration Tidal energy is taken from the Earth s oceanic tides Tidal forces result from periodic variations in gravitational attraction exerted by celestial bodies These forces create corresponding motions or currents in the world s oceans This results in periodic changes in sea levels varying as the Earth rotates These changes are highly regular and predictable due to the consistent pattern of the Earth s rotation and the Moon s orbit around the Earth The magnitude and variations of this motion reflect the changing positions of the Moon and Sun relative to the Earth the effects of Earth s rotation and local geography of the seafloor and coastlines Tidal power is the only technology that draws on energy inherent in the orbital characteristics of the Earth Moon system and to a lesser extent in the Earth Sun system Other natural energies exploited by human technology originate directly or indirectly from the Sun including fossil fuel conventional hydroelectric wind biofuel wave and solar energy Nuclear energy makes use of Earth s mineral deposits of fissionable elements while geothermal power utilizes the Earth s internal heat which comes from a combination of residual heat from planetary accretion about and heat produced through radioactive decay A tidal generator converts the energy of tidal flows into electricity Greater tidal variation and higher tidal current velocities can dramatically increase the potential of a site for tidal electricity generation On the other hand tidal energy has high reliability excellent energy density and high durability Because the Earth s tides are ultimately due to gravitational interaction with the Moon and Sun and the Earth s rotation tidal power is practically inexhaustible and is thus classified as a renewable energy resource Movement of tides causes a loss of mechanical energy in the Earth-Moon system this results from pumping of water through natural restrictions around coastlines and consequent viscous dissipation at the seabed and in turbulence This loss of energy has caused the rotation of the Earth to slow in the billion years since its formation During the last million years the period of rotation of the Earth length of a day has increased from hours to hours in this period the Earth-Moon system has lost of its rotational energy While tidal power will take additional energy from the system the effect is negligible and would not be noticeable in the foreseeable future Methods edit The world s first commercial-scale and grid-connected tidal stream generator SeaGen in Strangford Lough The strong wake shows the power in the tidal current Tidal power can be classified into four generating methods Tidal stream generator edit Main article Tidal stream generator Tidal stream generators make use of the kinetic energy of moving water to power turbines in a similar way to wind turbines that use the wind to power turbines Some tidal generators can be built into the structures of existing bridges or are entirely submersed thus avoiding concerns over aesthetics or visual impact Land constrictions such as straits or inlets can create high velocities at specific sites which can be captured using turbines These turbines can be horizontal vertical open or ducted Tidal barrage edit Main article Tidal barrage Tidal barrages use potential energy in the difference in height or hydraulic head between high and low tides When using tidal barrages to generate power the potential energy from a tide is seized through the strategic placement of specialized dams When the sea level rises and the tide begins to come in the temporary increase in tidal power is channeled into a large basin behind the dam holding a large amount of potential energy With the receding tide this energy is then converted into mechanical energy as the water is released through large turbines that create electrical power through the use of generators Barrages are essentially dams across the full width of a tidal estuary Tidal lagoon edit A new tidal energy design option is to construct circular retaining walls embedded with turbines that can capture the potential energy of tides The created reservoirs are similar to those of tidal barrages except that the location is artificial and does not contain a pre-existing ecosystem The lagoons can also be in double or triple format without pumping or with pumping that will flatten out the power output The pumping power could be provided by excess to grid demand renewable energy from for example wind turbines or solar photovoltaic arrays Excess renewable energy rather than being curtailed could be used and stored for a later period of time Geographically dispersed tidal lagoons with a time delay between peak production would also flatten out peak production providing near baseload production at a higher cost than other alternatives such as district heating renewable energy storage The cancelled Tidal Lagoon Swansea Bay in Wales United Kingdom would have been the first tidal power station of this type once built Dynamic tidal power edit Main article Dynamic tidal power Top-down diagram of a DTP dam Blue and dark red colours indicate low and high tides respectively Dynamic tidal power or DTP is a theoretical technology that would exploit an interaction between potential and kinetic energies in tidal flows It proposes that very long dams for example km length be built from coasts straight out into the sea or ocean without enclosing an area Tidal phase differences are introduced across the dam leading to a significant water-level differential in shallow coastal seas featuring strong coast-parallel oscillating tidal currents such as found in the UK China and Korea US and Canadian studies in the th century edit The first study of large scale tidal power plants was by the US Federal Power Commission in If built power plants would have been located in the northern border area of the US state of Maine and the southeastern border area of the Canadian province of New Brunswick with various dams powerhouses and ship locks enclosing the Bay of Fundy and Passamaquoddy Bay note see map in reference Nothing came of the study and it is unknown whether Canada had been approached about the study by the US Federal Power Commission In utility Nova Scotia Light and Power of Halifax commissioned a pair of studies into commercial tidal power development feasibility on the Nova Scotia side of the Bay of Fundy The two studies by Stone Webster of Boston and by Montreal Engineering Company of Montreal independently concluded that millions of horsepower i e gigawatts could be harnessed from Fundy but that development costs would be commercially prohibitive There was also a report on the international commission in April entitled Investigation of the International Passamaquoddy Tidal Power Project produced by both the US and Canadian Federal Governments According to benefit to costs ratios the project was beneficial to the US but not to Canada A study was commissioned by the Canadian Nova Scotian and New Brunswick governments Reassessment of Fundy Tidal Power to determine the potential for tidal barrages at Chignecto Bay and Minas Basin at the end of the Fundy Bay estuary There were three sites determined to be financially feasible Shepody Bay MW Cumberland Basin MW and Cobequid Bay MW These were never built despite their apparent feasibility in US studies in the st century edit The Snohomish PUD a public utility district located primarily in Snohomish County Washington State began a tidal energy project in In April the PUD selected OpenHydro a company based in Ireland to develop turbines and equipment for eventual installation The project as initially designed was to place generation equipment in areas of high tidal flow and operate that equipment for four to five years After the trial period the equipment would be removed The project was initially budgeted at a total cost of million with half of that funding provided by the PUD out of utility reserve funds and half from grants primarily from the US federal government The PUD paid for part of this project from reserves and received a grant in and a million grant in in addition to using reserves to pay an estimated million of costs In the budget estimate was increased to million half to be paid by the utility half by the federal government The utility was unable to control costs on this project and by October the costs had ballooned to an estimated million and were projected to continue to increase The PUD proposed that the federal government provide an additional million towards this increased cost citing a gentlemen s agreement When the federal government refused to pay this the PUD cancelled the project after spending nearly million from reserves and grants The PUD abandoned all tidal energy exploration after this project was cancelled and does not own or operate any tidal energy sources Rance tidal power plant in France edit In lectricit de France opened the Rance Tidal Power Station located on the estuary of the Rance River in Brittany It was the world s first tidal power station The plant was for years the largest tidal power station in the world by installed capacity Its turbines reach peak output at megawatts MW and average MW a capacity factor of approximately Tidal power development in the UK edit The world s first marine energy test facility was established in to start the development of the wave and tidal energy industry in the UK Based in Orkney Scotland the European Marine Energy Centre EMEC has supported the deployment of more wave and tidal energy devices than at any other single site in the world EMEC provides a variety of test sites in real sea conditions Its grid connected tidal test site is located at the Fall of Warness off the island of Eday in a narrow channel which concentrates the tide as it flows between the Atlantic Ocean and North Sea This area has a very strong tidal current which can travel up to m s mph kn km h in spring tides Tidal energy developers that have tested at the site include Alstom formerly Tidal Generation Ltd ANDRITZ HYDRO Hammerfest Atlantis Resources Corporation Nautricity OpenHydro Scotrenewables Tidal Power Voith The resource could be TJ per year Elsewhere in the UK annual energy of TWh can be extracted if GW capacity is installed with pivotable blades Current and future tidal power schemes edit Main article List of tidal power stations Roosevelt Island Tidal Energy RITE installation of three Verdant Power underwater -kilowatt turbines on a single triangular base called a TriFrame off the coast of New York City s Roosevelt Island on October The Rance tidal power plant built over a period of six years from to at La Rance France It has MW installed capacity MW Sihwa Lake Tidal Power Plant in South Korea is the largest tidal power installation in the world Construction was completed in The Jiangxia Tidal Power Station south of Hangzhou in China has been operational since with current installed capacity of MW More tidal power is planned near the mouth of the Yalu River The first in-stream tidal current generator in North America Race Rocks Tidal Power Demonstration Project was installed at Race Rocks on southern Vancouver Island in September The Race Rocks project was shut down after operating for five years because high operating costs produced electricity at a rate that was not economically feasible The next phase in the development of this tidal current generator will be in Nova Scotia Bay of Fundy A small project was built by the Soviet Union at Kislaya Guba on the Barents Sea It has MW installed capacity In it was upgraded with a MW experimental advanced orthogonal turbine Jindo Uldolmok Tidal Power Plant in South Korea is a tidal stream generation scheme planned to be expanded progressively to MW of capacity by The first MW was installed in May A MW SeaGen system became operational in late on Strangford Lough in Northern Ireland It was decommissioned and removed in The contract for an MW tidal barrage near Ganghwa Island South Korea north-west of Incheon has been signed by Daewoo Completion was planned for but project was retracted in A MW barrage was proposed by the South Korean government in to be built around islands west of Incheon The project halted since due to environmental concerns The Scottish Government has approved plans for a MW ran na Mara array of tidal stream generators near Islay Scotland costing million pounds and consisting of turbines enough to power over homes The first turbine was expected to be in operation by and then once again announced in but as of none existed The Indian state of Gujarat was planning to host South Asia s first commercial-scale tidal power station The company Atlantis Resources planned to install a MW tidal farm in the Gulf of Kutch on India s west coast with construction planned to start later withdrawn due to high costs Ocean Renewable Power Corporation was the first company to deliver tidal power to the US grid in September when its pilot TidGen system was successfully deployed in Cobscook Bay near Eastport In New York City Verdant Power successfully deployed and operated three tidal turbines in the East River near Roosevelt Island on a single triangular base system called a TriFrame The Roosevelt Island Tidal Energy RITE Project generated over MWh of electricity to the local grid an American marine energy record The system s performance was independently confirmed by Scotland s European Marine Energy Centre EMEC under the new International Electrotechnical Commission IEC international standards This is the first instance of a third-party verification of a tidal energy converter to an international standard The largest tidal energy project entitled MeyGen MW is currently in construction in the Pentland Firth in northern Scotland with MW operational since Construction of a MW tidal lagoon power plant outside the city of Swansea in the UK was granted planning permission in June however it was later rejected by the UK government in If built it would have been the world s first tidal power plant based on a constructed lagoon Mersey Tidal Power a proposed tidal range barrage within the channel of the Mersey Estuary with a capacity of up to GW is undergoing local consultation by the Liverpool City Region Combined Authority Up to MW of tidal stream generation is proposed at Morlais Anglesey from multiple developers with the first turbines expected to be installed in As of update a total of MW of capacity has been awarded Contracts for Difference to supply power to the GB grid Issues and challenges edit Environmental concerns edit Tidal power can affect marine life The turbines rotating blades can accidentally kill swimming sea life Projects such as the one in Strangford include a safety mechanism that turns off the turbine when marine animals approach However this feature causes a major loss in energy because of the amount of marine life that passes through the turbines Some fish may avoid the area if threatened by a constantly rotating or noisy object Marine life is a huge factor when siting tidal power energy generators and precautions are taken to ensure that as few marine animals as possible are affected by it In terms of global warming potential i e carbon footprint the impact of tidal power generation technologies ranges between and gCO -eq kWhe with a median value of gCO -eq kWhe This is in line with the impact of other renewables like wind and solar power and significantly better than fossil-based technologies The Tethys database provides access to scientific literature and general information on the potential environmental effects of tidal energy Tidal turbines edit The main environmental concern with tidal energy is associated with blade strike and entanglement of marine organisms as high-speed water increases the risk of organisms being pushed near or through these devices As with all offshore renewable energies there is also a concern about how the creation of electromagnetic fields and acoustic outputs may affect marine organisms Because these devices are in the water the acoustic output can be greater than those created with offshore wind energy Depending on the frequency and amplitude of sound generated by the tidal energy devices this acoustic output can have varying effects on marine mammals particularly those who echolocate to communicate and navigate in the marine environment such as dolphins and whales Tidal energy removal can also cause environmental concerns such as degrading far-field water quality and disrupting sediment processes Depending on the size of the project these effects can range from small traces of sediment building up near the tidal device to severely affecting nearshore ecosystems and processes Tidal barrage edit Installing a barrage may change the shoreline within the bay or estuary affecting a large ecosystem that depends on tidal flats Inhibiting the flow of water in and out of the bay there may also be less flushing of the bay or estuary causing additional turbidity suspended solids and less saltwater which may result in the death of fish that act as a vital food source to birds and mammals Migrating fish may also be unable to access breeding streams and may attempt to pass through the turbines The same acoustic concerns apply to tidal barrages Decreasing shipping accessibility can become a socio-economic issue though locks can be added to allow slow passage However the barrage may improve the local economy by increasing land access as a bridge Calmer waters may also allow better recreation in the bay or estuary In August a humpback whale swam through the open sluice gate of the Annapolis Royal Generating Station at slack tide ending up trapped for several days before eventually finding its way out to the Annapolis Basin Tidal lagoon edit Environmentally the main concerns are blade strike on fish attempting to enter the lagoon the acoustic output from turbines and changes in sedimentation processes However all these effects are localized and do not affect the entire estuary or bay Corrosion edit Saltwater causes corrosion in metal parts It can be difficult to maintain tidal stream generators due to their size and depth in the water The use of corrosion-resistant materials such as stainless steels high-nickel alloys copper-nickel alloys nickel-copper alloys and titanium can greatly reduce or eliminate corrosion damage Composite materials could also be used as composites do not corrode and could provide lightweight durable structures for tidal power Composite materials are being evaluated for tidal power Mechanical fluids such as lubricants can leak out which may be harmful to the marine life nearby Proper maintenance can minimize the number of harmful chemicals that may enter the environment Fouling edit The biological events that happen when placing any structure in an area of high tidal currents and high biological productivity in the ocean will ensure that the structure becomes an ideal substrate for the growth of marine organisms Cost edit Tidal energy has a high initial cost which may be one of the reasons why it is not a popular source of renewable energy although research has shown that the public is willing to pay for and support research and development of tidal energy devices The methods of generating electricity from tidal energy are relatively new technology Tidal energy is however still very early in the research process and it may be possible to reduce costs in future The cost-effectiveness varies according to the site of the tidal generators One indication of cost-effectiveness is the Gibrat ratio which is the length of the barrage in metres divided by the annual energy production in kilowatt hours As tidal energy is reliable it can reasonably be predicted how long it will take to pay off the high up-front cost of these generators Due to the success of a greatly simplified design the orthogonal turbine offers considerable cost savings As a result the production period of each generating unit is reduced lower metal consumption is needed and technical efficiency is greater A possible risk is rising sea levels due to climate change which may alter the characteristics of the local tides reducing future power generation Structural health monitoring edit The high load factors resulting from the fact that water is around times denser than air and the predictable and reliable nature of tides compared with the wind make tidal energy particularly attractive for electric power generation Condition monitoring is the key for exploiting it cost-efficiently See also edit Renewable energy portal Oceans portal Energy portal Water portal

    "content": "Tidal stream generator - Wikipedia Jump to content From Wikipedia the free encyclopedia Type of tidal power generation technology Two types of Tidal Stream Generators Evopod - A semi-submerged floating approach tested in Strangford Lough with SeaGen in the background A tidal stream generator often referred to as a tidal energy converter TEC is a machine that extracts energy from moving masses of water in particular tides although the term is often used in reference to machines designed to extract energy from the run of a river or tidal estuarine sites Certain types of these machines function very much like underwater wind turbines and are thus often referred to as tidal turbines They were first conceived in the s during the oil crisis Tidal stream generators are the cheapest and least ecologically damaging among the four main forms of tidal power generation Similarity to wind turbines edit The kinetic energy of a water current is converted into electricity by a turbine-generator system Tidal stream generators draw energy from water currents in much the same way as wind turbines draw energy from air currents However the potential for power generation by an individual tidal turbine can be greater than that of a similarly rated wind energy turbine The higher density of water relative to air water is about times the density of air means that a single generator can provide significant power at low tidal flow velocities compared with similar wind speeds Given that power varies with the density of medium and the cube of velocity water speeds of nearly one-tenth the speed of wind provide the same power for the same size of turbine system however this limits the application in practice to places where tide speed is at least knots m s even close to neap tides Furthermore at higher speeds in a flow between and meters per second in seawater a tidal turbine can typically access four times as much energy per rotor swept area as a similarly rated power wind turbine Types of tidal stream generators edit No standard tidal stream generator has emerged as the clear winner among a large variety of designs Several prototypes have shown promise with many companies making bold claims some of which are yet to be independently verified but they have not operated commercially for extended periods to establish performance and rates of return on investments Some of the many companies and turbines tested are summarised in development of tidal stream generators The European Marine Energy Centre recognizes six principal types of tidal energy converters They are horizontal axis turbines vertical axis turbines oscillating hydrofoils venturi devices Archimedes screws and tidal kites Axial turbines edit This section needs to be updated Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information March Bottom-mounted axial turbines A cable-tethered turbine These are similar in concept to traditional windmills but operate under the sea They have most of the prototypes currently under design development testing or operations The SR a prototype MW floating turbine developed by Orbital Marine Power in Scotland was operated at the European Marine Energy Centre Orkney from It produced MWhs of electricity in months of continuous testing It was removed in September to make way for the Orbital O the production model completed in Tocardo a Dutch-based company has been running tidal turbines since on the Afsluitdijk near Den Oever Typical production data of tidal generator shown in the T model as applied in Den Oever Currently river model R and tidal models T are in production with a rd T coming soon Power production for the T is around kW and around kW for the T These are suitable for tidal currents as low as m s Tocardo were declared bankrupt in QED Naval and HydroWing have joined forces to buy tidal turbine business Tocardo in The AR- a MW turbine developed by Atlantis Resources Corporation was successfully deployed at the EMEC facility during the summer of The AR series are commercial-scale horizontal-axis turbines designed for open ocean deployment AR turbines feature a single rotor set with fixed-pitch blades The AR turbine is rotated as required with each tidal exchange This is done in the slack period between tides and held in place for the optimal heading for the next tide AR turbines are rated at MW at m s of water flow velocity The Kvalsund installation is south of Hammerfest Norway at a -meter depth of sea Although still a prototype the HS turbine with a reported capacity of kW was connected to the grid on November This made it the world s first tidal turbine delivering to the grid The submerged structure weighed tonnes and had gravity footings of tonnes Its three-blades were made in glass fibre-reinforced plastic and measured metres from hub to tip The device rotated at rpm with an installed capacity of MW Seaflow a kW periodflow marine current propeller type turbine was installed by Marine Current Turbines off the coast of Lynmouth Devon England in The -meter-diameter turbine generator was fitted to a steel pile which was driven into the seabed As a prototype it was connected to a dump load not to the grid In April Verdant Power began running a prototype project in the East River between Queens and Roosevelt Island in New York City it was the first major tidal-power project in the United States The strong currents pose challenges to the design the blades of the and prototypes broke and new reinforced turbines were installed in September Following the Seaflow trial a full-size prototype called SeaGen was installed by Marine Current Turbines in Strangford Lough in Northern Ireland in April The turbine began to generate at full power of just over MW in December is reported to have fed kW into the grid for the first time on July and has now contributed more than a gigawatt hour to consumers in Northern Ireland It is currently the only commercial-scale device to have been installed anywhere in the world SeaGen is made up of two axial flow rotors each of which drive a generator The turbines are capable of generating electricity on both the ebb and flood tides because the rotor blades can pitch through A D model of an Evopod tidal turbine A prototype semi-submerged floating tethered tidal turbine called Evopod has been tested since June in Strangford Lough Northern Ireland at scale The UK company developing it is called Ocean Flow Energy Ltd The advanced hull form maintains optimum heading into the tidal stream and is designed to operate in the peak flow of the water column In Tenax Energy of Australia proposed to put turbines off the coast of Darwin Australia in the Clarence Strait The turbines would feature a rotor section approximately metres in diameter with a slightly larger gravity base The turbines would operate in deep water well below shipping channels Each turbine is forecast to produce energy for between and homes Tidalstream a UK-based company commissioned a scaled-down Triton turbine on the Thames in It can be floated to its site installed without cranes jack-ups or divers and then ballasted into an operating position At full scale the Triton in m deep water has a MW capacity and the Triton in m deep water has a capacity of up to MW depending on the flow Both platforms have man-access capability both in the operating position and in the float-out maintenance position European Technology Innovation Platform for Ocean Energy s ETIP OCEAN report Powering Homes Today Powering Nations Tomorrow makes note of record volumes being supplied through tidal stream technology Crossflow turbines edit Invented by Georges Darreius in and patented in these turbines can be deployed either vertically or horizontally The Gorlov turbine is a variant of the Darrieus design featuring a helical design that is in a large-scale commercial pilot in South Korea starting with a MW plant that opened in May and expanding to MW by Neptune Renewable Energy s Proteus project employs a shrouded vertical axis turbine that can be used to form an array in mainly estuarine conditions In April the Ocean Renewable Power Company LLC ORPC successfully completed testing its proprietary turbine-generator unit TGU prototype at ORPC s Cobscook Bay and Western Passage tidal sites near Eastport Maine The TGU is the core of the OCGen technology and uses advanced design cross-flow ADCF turbines to drive a permanent magnet generator located between the turbines and mounted on the same shaft ORPC has developed TGU designs that can be used for generating power from river tidal and deep water ocean currents Trials in the Strait of Messina Italy started in of the Kobold turbine concept Flow augmented turbines edit A shrouded turbine Using flow augmentation measures for example a duct or shroud the incident power available to a turbine can be increased The most common example uses a shroud to increase the flow rate through the turbine which can be either axial or crossflow The Australian company Tidal Energy Pty Ltd undertook successful commercial trials of efficient shrouded tidal turbines on the Gold Coast Queensland in Tidal Energy delivered their shrouded turbine in northern Australia where some of the fastest recorded flows m s knots are found Two small turbines will provide MW Another larger meter diameter turbine capable of kW in m s of flow was planned as a tidal-powered desalination showcase near Brisbane Australia Oscillating devices edit Oscillating devices do not have a rotating component instead making use of aerofoil sections that are pushed sideways by the flow Oscillating stream power extraction was proven with the omni- or bi-directional Wing d Pump windmill During a kW oscillating hydroplane device the Stingray tidal stream generator was tested off the Scottish coast The Stingray uses hydrofoils to create oscillation which allows it to create hydraulic power This hydraulic power is then used to power a hydraulic motor which then turns a generator Pulse Tidal operate an oscillating hydrofoil device called Pulse generator in the Humber Estuary Having secured funding from the EU they are developing a commercial-scale device to be commissioned The bioSTREAM tidal power conversion system uses the biomimicry of swimming species such as sharks tuna and mackerel using their highly efficient Thunniform mode propulsion It is produced by Australian company BioPower Systems A kW prototype relying on the use of two oscillating hydrofoils in a tandem configuration called oscillating wing tidal turbine has been developed at Laval University and tested successfully near Quebec City Canada in A hydrodynamic efficiency of has been achieved during the field tests Venturi effect edit See also Venturi effect Venturi effect devices use a shroud or duct in order to generate a pressure differential which is used to run a secondary hydraulic circuit which is used to generate power A device the Hydro Venturi is to be tested in San Francisco Bay Tidal kite turbines edit A tidal kite turbine is an underwater kite system or paravane that converts tidal energy into electricity by moving through the tidal stream An estimated of s global energy requirements could be provided by such devices at scale History Ernst Souczek of Vienna Austria on August filed for a patent US assignor of one-half to Wolfgang Kmentt also of Vienna Their water kite turbine disclosure demonstrated a rich art in water-kite turbines In similar technology many others prior to advanced water-kite and paravane electric generating systems In a tidal kite turbine called the Deep Green Kite was developed by Swedish company Minesto They conducted its first sea trial in Strangford Lough in Northern Ireland in the summer of The test used kites with wingspan of m In the Deep Green pilot plant began operation off Northern Ireland The plant uses carbon fiber kites with a wingspan of m or m Each kite has a rated power of kilowatts at a tidal flow of meters per second Design Minesto s kite has a wingspan of metres ft The kite has neutral buoyancy so doesn t sink as the tide turns from ebb to flow Each kite is equipped with a gearless turbine to generate which is transmitted by the attachment cable to a transformer and then to the electricity grid The turbine mouth is protected to protect marine life The -meter version has a rated power of kilowatts at meters per second Operation The kite is tethered by a cable to a fixed point It flies through the current carrying a turbine It moves in a figure-eight loop to increase the speed of the water flowing through the turbine tenfold Force increases with the cube of velocity offering the potential to generate -fold more energy than a stationary generator That maneuver means the kite can operate in tidal streams that move too slowly to drive earlier tidal devices such as the SeaGen turbine The kite was expected to work in flows as low metres ft in ft in per second while first-generation devices need over s Each kite will have a capacity to generate between and kW They can be deployed in waters metres ft deep Tidal stream developers edit See also Development of tidal stream generators There are many individuals and companies developing tidal energy converters across the world although few have progressed beyond the concept on initial testing stage A database of tidal energy developers can be found on the EMEC website at Tidal energy developers Tidal stream developers with turbines in the water as of update include HydroQuest France LHD New Energy Corporation China Magallanes Renovables Spain Minesto Sweden Nova Innovation Scotland UK Ocean Renewable Power Company Maine USA Orbital Marine Power Scotland UK with the Orbital O SAE Renewables Singapore UK develop the MeyGen project although turbine development was spun out to Proteus Marine England UK Tocardo Netherlands Tidal stream testing edit The world s first marine energy test facility was established in to kick start the development of the wave and tidal energy industry in the UK Based in Orkney Scotland the European Marine Energy Centre EMEC has supported the deployment of more wave and tidal energy devices than at any other single site in the world EMEC provides a variety of test sites in real sea conditions Its grid connected tidal test site is located at the Fall of Warness off the island of Eday in a narrow channel which concentrates the tide as it flows between the Atlantic Ocean and North Sea This area has a very strong tidal current which can travel up to m s knots in spring tides Tidal energy developers that have tested at the site include Alstom formerly Tidal Generation Ltd ANDRITZ HYDRO Hammerfest Atlantis Resources now SAE Nautricity OpenHydro Orbital Marine Power formerly Scotrenewables Tidal Power and Voith The Fundy Ocean Research Center for Energy FORCE Test Site was set up in in the Bay of Fundy Canada to test tidal devices inn one of the strongest tidal currents in the world The site has grid-connected test berths and developers who have tested there include OpenHydro and Sustainable Marine Energy In the Zhoushan Tidal Current Energy Demonstration Project was set up in Zhoushan Zhejiang province China by the China Three Gorges Corporation It has included grid-connected tidal power demonstration As of update two more tidal test sites are under development in Asia the Korea Tidal Current Energy Centre KTEC in Jindo southwestern South Korea and the Sentosa Tidal Test Site in Sentosa island Singapore Commercial plans edit In The Crown Estate awarded an agreement for lease to MeyGen Limited granting the option to develop a tidal stream project of up to MW at an offshore site between Scotland s northernmost coast and the island of Stroma As of update MeyGen the largest planned tidal farm project worldwide The first phase of the MeyGen project Phase A is operational with four MW turbines and subsequent phases are under way SIMEC Atlantis Energy now SAE was awarded Contracts for Difference totalling MW for the next phases to be built by Also in the West Anglesey Demonstration Zone off Anglesey North Wales was designated for tidal stream generation This project is now called Morlais and was consented in

Difference to supply power to the GB grid by Magallanes Renovables Nova Innovation and Orbital Marine Power have all been awarded Contracts for Difference to install a total of MW grid-connected tidal power at the EMEC Fall of Warness site In France two projects are proposed at Raz Blanchard The MW FloWatt project developed by HydroQuest and Qair is expected to be commissioned in Normandie Hydroliennes is planning a MW project with four Proteus Marine Renewables AR turbines Historical plans edit There have been many abandoned or postponed tidal stream projects a selection of which are summarised here In November British company Lunar Energy announced that in conjunction with E ON they would be building the world s first deep-sea tidal energy farm off the coast of Pembrokeshire in Wales expected to provide electricity for homes Eight underwater turbines each metres long and metres high were to be installed on the sea bottom off St David s peninsula Construction was due to start in the summer of operational by Lunar Energy was dissolved in Alderney Renewable Energy Ltd was granted a licence in and is planning to use tidal turbines to extract power from the notoriously strong tidal races around Alderney in the Channel Islands It is estimated that up to GW could be extracted This would not only supply the island s needs but also leave a considerable surplus for export using a France-Alderney-Britain cable FAB Link which was expected to go online by This agreement was terminated in In RWE s npower announced that it is in partnership with Marine Current Turbines to build a MW tidal farm of SeaGen S tidal turbines off the coast of Anglesey in Wales near the Skerries with planning permission given in The array was expected to be fully operational by however the project was shelved in after Marine Current Turbines was acquired by SIMEC Atlantis Energy In Welsh companies Tidal Energy Ltd TEL and Eco aimed to deploy a commercial scale demonstration project with nine turbines at St Davids Head However TEL went into administration less than a year after developing and testing the kW DeltaStream turbine in In March the Federal Energy Regulatory Committee FERC approved a pilot license for Snohomish County PUD to install two OpenHydro tidal turbines in Admiralty Inlet WA This project is the first grid-connected two-turbine project in the US installation is planned for the summer of The tidal turbines will use are designed to be placed directly into the seafloor at a depth of roughly feet so that there will be no effect on commercial navigation overhead The license granted by the FERC also includes plans to protect fish wildlife as well as cultural and aesthetic resources in addition to navigation Each turbine measures meters in diameter and will generate up to kW of electricity In September the project was cancelled due to cost concerns Nova Scotia Power selected OpenHydro s turbine for a tidal energy demonstration project in the Bay of Fundy Nova Scotia Canada and Alderney Renewable Energy Ltd for the supply of tidal turbines in the Channel Islands OpenHydro was liquidated in ScottishPower Renewables planned to deploy ten MW HS devices designed by Hammerfest Strom in the Sound of Islay in Energy calculations edit Turbine power edit Tidal energy converters can have varying modes of operating and therefore varying power output If the power coefficient of the device C P displaystyle C P is known the equation below can be used to determine the power output of the hydrodynamic subsystem of the machine This available power cannot exceed that imposed by the Betz limit on the power coefficient although this can be circumvented to some degree by placing a turbine in a shroud or duct This works in essence by forcing water which would not have flowed through the turbine through the rotor disk In these situations it is the frontal area of the duct rather than the turbine which is used in calculating the power coefficient and therefore the Betz limit still applies to the device as a whole The energy available from these kinetic systems can be expressed as P A V C P displaystyle P frac rho AV C P where C P displaystyle C P the turbine power coefficient P the power generated in watts displaystyle rho the density of the water seawater is kg m A the sweep area of the turbine in m V the velocity of the flow Relative to an open turbine in free stream ducted turbines are capable of as much as to times the power of the same turbine rotor in open flow Resource assessment edit While initial assessments of the available energy in a channel have focus on calculations using the kinetic energy flux model the limitations of tidal power generation are significantly more complicated For example the maximum physical possible energy extraction from a strait connecting two large basins is given to within by P g H max Q max displaystyle P rho g Delta H text max Q text max where displaystyle rho the density of the water seawater is kg m g gravitational acceleration m s H max displaystyle Delta H text max maximum differential water surface elevation across the channel Q max displaystyle Q text max maximum volumetric flow rate though the channel Potential sites edit As with wind power selection of location is critical for the tidal turbine Tidal stream systems need to be located in areas with fast currents where natural flows are concentrated between obstructions for example at the entrances to bays and rivers around rocky points headlands or between islands or other land masses The following potential sites are under serious consideration Pembrokeshire in Wales River Severn between Wales and England Cook Strait in New Zealand Kaipara Harbour in New Zealand Bay of Fundy in Canada East River in the United States Golden Gate in the San Francisco Bay Piscataqua River in New Hampshire The Race of Alderney and The Swinge in the Channel Islands The Sound of Islay between Islay and Jura in Scotland Pentland Firth between Caithness and the Orkney Islands Scotland Humboldt County California in the United States Columbia River Oregon in the United States Plaquemines Parish Louisiana in the Southern United States Isle of Wight England Teddington and Ham Hydro at Teddington on the River Thames in the London suburbs England Modern advances in turbine technology may eventually see large amounts of power generated from the ocean especially tidal currents using the tidal stream designs but also from the major thermal current systems such as the Gulf Stream which is covered by the more general term marine current power Tidal stream turbines may be arrayed in high-velocity areas where natural tidal current flows are concentrated such as the west and east coasts of Canada the Strait of Gibraltar the Bosporus and numerous sites in Southeast Asia and Australia Such flows occur almost anywhere where there are entrances to bays and rivers or between land masses where water currents are concentrated Environmental impacts edit The main environmental concern with tidal energy is associated with blade strike and entanglement of marine organisms as high speed water increases the risk of organisms being pushed near or through these devices As with all offshore renewable energies there is also a concern about how the creation of EMF and acoustic outputs may affect marine organisms Because these devices are in the water the acoustic output can be greater than those created with offshore wind energy Depending on the frequency and amplitude of sound generated by the tidal energy devices this acoustic output can have varying effects on marine mammals particularly those who echolocate to communicate and navigate in the marine environment such as dolphins and whales Tidal energy removal can also cause environmental concerns such as degrading farfield water quality and disrupting sediment processes Depending on the size of the project these effects can range from small traces of sediment build up near the tidal device to severely affecting nearshore ecosystems and processes One study of the Roosevelt Island Tidal Energy RITE Verdant Power project in the East River New York City used split beam hydroacoustic sensors scientific echosounder to detect and track the movement of fish both upstream and downstream of each of six turbines The results suggested very few fish using this portion of the river those fish which did use this area were not using the portion of the river which would subject them to blade strikes and no evidence of fish traveling through blade areas Work is currently being conducted by the Northwest National Marine Renewable Energy Center NNMREC to explore and establish tools and protocols for assessment of physical and biological

the capture of energy of wind waves to do useful work for example electricity generation desalination or pumping water A machine that exploits wave power is a wave energy converter WEC Waves are generated primarily by wind passing over the sea s surface and also by tidal forces temperature variations and other factors As long as the waves propagate slower than the wind speed just above energy is transferred from the wind to the waves Air pressure differences between the windward and leeward sides of a wave crest and surface friction from the wind cause shear stress and wave growth Wave power as a descriptive term is different from tidal power which seeks to primarily capture the energy of the current caused by the gravitational pull of the Sun and Moon However wave power and tidal power are not fundamentally distinct and have significant cross-over in technology and implementation Other forces can create currents including breaking waves wind the Coriolis effect cabbeling and temperature and salinity differences As of wave power is not widely employed for commercial applications after a long series of trial projects Attempts to use this energy began in or earlier mainly due to its high power density Just below the ocean s water surface the wave energy flow in time-average is typically five times denser than the wind energy flow m above the sea surface and to times denser than the solar energy flow In the world s first commercial wave power device the Islay LIMPET was installed on the coast of Islay in Scotland and connected to the UK national grid In the first experimental multi-generator wave farm was opened in Portugal at the Agu adoura Wave Farm Both projects have since ended For a list of other wave power stations see List of wave power stations Wave energy converters can be classified based on their working principle as either oscillating water columns with air turbine oscillating bodies with hydroelectric motor hydraulic turbine linear electrical generator overtopping devices with low-head hydraulic turbine History edit The first known patent to extract energy from ocean waves was in filed in Paris by Pierre-Simon Girard and his son An early device was constructed around by Bochaux-Praceique to power his house in Royan France It appears that this was the first oscillating water-column type of wave-energy device From to there were patents filed in the UK alone Modern pursuit of wave energy was pioneered by Yoshio Masuda s s experiments He tested various concepts constructing hundreds of units used to power navigation lights Among these was the concept of extracting power from the angular motion at the joints of an articulated raft which Masuda proposed in the s The oil crisis in renewed interest in wave energy Substantial wave-energy development programmes were launched by governments in several countries in particular in the UK Norway and Sweden Researchers re-examined waves potential to extract energy notably Stephen Salter Johannes Falnes Kjell Budal Michael E McCormick David Evans Michael French Nick Newman and C C Mei Salter s invention became known as Salter s duck or nodding duck officially the Edinburgh Duck In small-scale tests the Duck s curved cam -like body can stop of wave motion and can convert of that to electricity giving efficiency In the s several other first-generation prototypes were tested but as oil prices ebbed wave-energy funding shrank Climate change later reenergized the field The world s first wave energy test facility was established in Orkney Scotland in to kick-start the development of a wave and tidal energy industry The European Marine Energy Centre EMEC has supported the deployment of more wave and tidal energy devices than any other single site Subsequent to its establishment test facilities occurred also in many other countries around the world providing services and infrastructure for device testing The million Saltire prize challenge was to be awarded to the first to be able to generate GWh from wave power over a continuous two-year period by about MW average The prize was never awarded A study by Strathclyde University and Imperial College focused on the failure to develop market ready wave energy devices despite a UK government investment of over million over years Public bodies have continued and in many countries stepped up the research and development funding for wave energy during the s This includes both EU US and UK where the annual allocation has typically been in the range - million USD Combined with private funding this has led to a large number of ongoing wave energy projects see List of wave power projects Physical concepts edit Main article Airy wave theory Like most fluid motion the interaction

highest at the surface and diminishes exponentially with depth However for standing waves clapotis near a reflecting coast wave energy is also present as pressure oscillations at great depth producing microseisms Pressure fluctuations at greater depth are too small to be interesting for wave power conversion The behavior of Airy waves offers two interesting regimes water deeper than half the wavelength as is common in the sea and ocean and shallow water with wavelengths larger than about twenty times the water depth Deep waves are dispersionful Waves of long wavelengths propagate faster and tend to outpace those with shorter wavelengths Deep-water group velocity is half the phase velocity Shallow water waves are dispersionless group velocity is equal to phase velocity and wavetrains

wave energy period the water density and g the acceleration by gravity The above formula states that wave power is proportional to the wave energy period and to the square of the wave height When the significant wave height is given in metres and the wave period in seconds the result is the wave power in kilowatts kW per metre of wavefront length For example consider moderate ocean swells in deep

text s approx frac text kW text m or kilowatts of power potential per meter of wave crest In major storms the largest offshore sea states have significant wave height of about meters and energy period of about seconds According to the above formula such waves carry about MW of power across each meter of wavefront An effective wave power device captures a significant portion of the wave energy flux As a result wave heights diminish in the region behind the device Energy and energy flux edit In a sea state the mean energy density per unit area of gravity waves on the water surface is proportional to the wave height squared according to linear wave theory E g H m displaystyle E frac rho gH m c where E is the mean wave energy density per unit horizontal area J m the sum of kinetic and potential energy density per unit horizontal area The potential energy density is equal to the kinetic energy both contributing half to the wave energy density E as can be expected from the equipartition theorem The waves propagate on the surface where crests travel with the phase velocity while the energy is transported horizontally with the group velocity The mean transport rate of the wave energy through a vertical plane of unit width parallel to a wave crest is the energy flux or wave power not to be confused with the output produced by a device and is equal to P E c g displaystyle P E c g with c g the group velocity m s Due to the dispersion relation for waves under gravity the group velocity depends on the wavelength or equivalently on the wave period T Wave height is determined by wind speed the length of time the wind has been blowing fetch the distance over which the wind excites the waves and by the bathymetry which can focus or disperse the energy of the waves A given wind speed has a matching practical limit over which time or distance do not increase wave size At this limit the waves are said to be fully developed In general larger waves are more powerful but wave power is also determined by wavelength water density water depth and acceleration of gravity Wave energy converters edit Generic wave energy concepts Point absorber Attenuator Oscillating wave surge converter Oscillating water column Overtopping device Submerged pressure differential Floating in-air converters Wave energy converters WECs are generally categorized by the method by location and by the power take-off system Locations are shoreline nearshore and offshore Types of power take-off include hydraulic ram elastomeric hose pump pump-to-shore hydroelectric turbine air turbine and linear electrical generator Different conversion routes from wave energy to useful energy in terms or electricity or direct use The four most common approaches are point absorber buoys surface attenuators oscillating water columns overtopping devices Point absorber buoy edit This device floats on the surface held in place by cables connected to the seabed The point-absorber has a device width much smaller than the incoming wavelength Energy is absorbed by radiating a wave with destructive interference to the incoming waves Buoys use the swells rise and fall to generate electricity directly via linear generators generators driven by mechanical linear-to-rotary converters or hydraulic pumps Energy extracted from waves may affect the shoreline implying that sites should remain well offshore One point absorber design tested at commercial scale by CorPower features a negative spring that improves performance and protects the buoy in very large waves It also has an internal pneumatic cylinder that keeps the buoy at a fixed distance from the seabed regardless of the state of the tide Under normal operating conditions the buoy bobs up and down at double the wave amplitude by adjusting the phase of its movements It rises with a slight delay from the wave which allows it to extract more energy The firm claimed a increase kW in power generation compared to a buoy without phase adjustments in tests completed in Surface attenuator edit These devices use multiple floating segments connected to one another They are oriented perpendicular to incoming waves A flexing motion is created by swells and that motion drives hydraulic pumps to generate electricity The Pelamis Wave Energy Converter is one of the more well-known attenuator concepts although this is no longer being developed Oscillating wave surge converter edit These devices typically have one end fixed to a structure or the seabed while the other end is free to move Energy is collected from the relative motion of the body compared to the fixed point Converters often come in the form of floats flaps or membranes Some designs incorporate parabolic reflectors to focus energy at the point of capture These systems capture energy from the rise and fall of waves Oscillating water column edit Oscillating water column devices can be located onshore or offshore Swells compress air in an internal chamber forcing air through a turbine to create electricity Significant noise is produced as air flows through the turbines potentially affecting nearby birds and marine organisms Marine life could possibly become trapped or entangled within the air chamber It draws energy from the entire water column Overtopping device edit Overtopping devices are long structures that use wave velocity to fill a reservoir to a greater water level than the surrounding ocean The potential energy in the reservoir height is captured with low-head turbines Devices can be on- or offshore Submerged pressure differential edit Submerged pressure differential based converters use flexible typically reinforced rubber membranes to extract wave energy These converters use the difference in pressure at different locations below a wave to produce a pressure difference within a closed power take-off hydraulic system This pressure difference is usually used to produce flow which drives a turbine and electrical generator Submerged pressure differential converters typically use flexible membranes as the working surface between the water and the power take-off Membranes are pliant and low mass which can strengthen coupling with the wave s energy Their pliancy allows large changes in the geometry of the working surface which can be used to tune the converter for specific wave conditions and to protect it from excessive loads in extreme conditions A submerged converter may be positioned either on the seafloor or in midwater In both cases the converter is protected from water impact loads which can occur at the free surface Wave loads also diminish in non-linear proportion to the distance below the free surface This means that by optimizing depth protection from extreme loads and access to wave energy can be balanced Floating in-air converters edit Wave power station using a pneumatic chamber Simplified design of wave power station Floating in-air converters potentially offer increased reliability because the device is located above the water which also eases inspection and maintenance Examples of different concepts of floating in-air converters include roll damping energy extraction systems with turbines in compartments containing sloshing water horizontal axis pendulum systems vertical axis pendulum systems Submerged wave energy converters edit In early a fully submerged wave energy converter using point absorber-type wave energy technology was approved in Spain The converter includes a buoy that is moored to the bottom and situated below the surface out of sight of people and away from storm waves Environmental effects edit Further information Environmental impact of electricity generation Common environmental concerns associated with marine energy include The effects of electromagnetic fields and underwater noise Physical presence s potential to alter the behavior of marine mammals fish and seabirds with attraction avoidance entanglement Potential effect on marine processes such as sediment transport and water quality Foundation mooring systems can affect benthic organisms via entanglement entrapment Electromotive force effects produced from subsea power cables Minor collision risk Artificial reef accumulation near fixed installations Potential disruption to roosting sites The Tethys database provides access to scientific literature and general information on the potential environmental effects of ocean current energy Potential edit Wave energy s worldwide theoretical potential has been estimated to be greater than TW Locations with the most potential for wave power include the western seaboard of Europe the northern coast of the UK and the Pacific coastlines of North and South America Southern Africa Australia and New Zealand The north and south temperate zones have the best sites for capturing wave power The prevailing westerlies in these zones blow strongest in winter World wave energy resource map The National Renewable Energy Laboratory NREL estimated the theoretical wave energy potential for various countries It estimated that the US potential was equivalent to TWh per year or almost of the country s electricity consumption The Alaska coastline accounted for of the total The technical and economical potential will be lower than the given values for the theoretical potential Wave energy is known as a tertiary form of energy where the sun primary heats the earth s surface unevenly leading to climate systems such as wind secondary to blow across the oceans Although tidal currents also play a role wave energy is primarily a product of wind energy The transfer of energy from one source to another is greatly diminished due to the First Law of Thermodynamics where not all of the energy is converted Conversly the concentration of energy energy density can be significantly increased compared to the energy source prior For the conversion of wind to wave energy this is due to water having a greater density than air and again due to the uneven energy distribution This makes many locations around the globe extremely favourable for wave energy conversion Challenges edit This section needs expansion with what are the main technical difficulties You can help by adding to it February Environmental impacts must be addressed Socio-economic challenges include the displacement of commercial and recreational fishermen and may present navigation hazards Supporting infrastructure such as grid connections must be provided Commercial WECs have not always been successful In for example Seabased Industries AB in Sweden was liquidated due to extensive challenges in recent years both practical and financial Current wave power generation technology is subject to many technical limitations These limitations stem from the complex and dynamic nature of ocean waves which require robust and efficient technology to capture the energy Challenges include designing and building wave energy devices that can withstand the corrosive effects of saltwater harsh weather conditions and extreme wave forces Additionally optimizing the performance and efficiency of wave energy converters such as oscillating water column OWC devices point absorbers and overtopping devices requires overcoming engineering complexities related to the dynamic and variable nature of waves Furthermore developing effective mooring and anchoring systems to keep wave energy devices in place in the harsh ocean environment and developing reliable and efficient power take-off mechanisms to convert the captured wave energy into electricity are also technical challenges in wave power generation As the wave energy dissipation by a submerged flexible mound breakwater is greater than that of a rigid submerged structure greater wave energy dissipation is expected due to highly deformed shape of the structure Wave farms edit A wave farm wave power farm or wave energy park is a group of colocated wave energy devices The devices interact hydrodynamically and electrically according to the number of machines spacing and layout wave climate coastal and benthic geometry and control strategies The design process is a multi- optimization problem seeking high power production low costs and limited power fluctuations Nearshore wave farms have substantial impact on beach dynamics For instance wave farms significantly reduce erosion which demonstrates that this synergy between coastal protection and energy production enhances the economic viability of wave energy Additional research finds that

the use of wind energy to generate useful work Historically wind power was used by sails windmills and windpumps but today it is mostly used to generate electricity This article deals only with wind power for electricity generation Today wind power is generated almost completely using wind turbines generally grouped into wind farms and connected to the electrical grid In wind supplied about TWh of electricity which was over of world electricity With about GW added during mostly in China and the United States global installed wind power capacity exceeded GW countries generated more than a tenth of their electricity from wind power in and wind generation has nearly tripled since To help meet the Paris Agreement goals to limit climate change analysts say it should expand much faster by over of electricity generation per year Wind power is a sustainable renewable energy source and has a much smaller impact on the environment than burning fossil fuels Wind power is variable so it needs energy storage or other dispatchable generation energy sources to attain a reliable supply of electricity Land-based onshore wind farms have a greater visual impact on the landscape than most other power stations per energy produced Wind farms sited offshore have less visual impact and have higher capacity factors although they are generally more expensive Offshore wind power currently has a share of about of new installations Wind power is one of the lowest-cost electricity sources per unit of energy produced In many locations new onshore wind farms are cheaper than new coal or gas plants Regions in the higher northern and southern latitudes have the highest potential for wind power In most regions wind power generation is higher in nighttime and in winter when solar power output is low So combinations of wind and solar power are suitable in many countries Wind energy resources Global map of wind speed at meters on land and around coasts Distribution of wind speed red and energy blue for all of at the Lee Ranch facility in Colorado The histogram shows measured data while the curve is the Rayleigh model distribution for the same average wind speed Global map of wind power density potential Wind is air movement in the Earth s atmosphere In a unit of time say second the volume of air that had passed an area A displaystyle A is A v displaystyle Av If the air density is displaystyle rho the flow rate of this volume of air is M t A v displaystyle tfrac M Delta t rho Av and the power transfer or energy transfer per second is P M t v A v displaystyle P tfrac tfrac M Delta t v tfrac rho Av Wind power is thus proportional to the third power of the wind speed the available power increases eightfold when the wind speed doubles Change of wind speed by a factor of increases the wind power by one order of magnitude multiply by The global wind kinetic energy averaged approximately MJ m over the period from to MJ m in the Northern Hemisphere with MJ m in the Southern Hemisphere The atmosphere acts as a thermal engine absorbing heat at higher temperatures releasing heat at lower temperatures The process is responsible for the production of wind kinetic energy at a rate of W m thus sustaining the circulation of the atmosphere against friction Through wind resource assessment it is possible to estimate wind power potential globally by country or region or for a specific site The Global Wind Atlas provided by the Technical University of Denmark in partnership with the World Bank provides a global assessment of wind power potential Unlike static wind resource atlases which average estimates of wind speed and power density across multiple years tools such as Renewables ninja provide time-varying simulations of wind speed and power output from different wind turbine models at an hourly resolution More detailed site-specific assessments of wind resource potential can be obtained from specialist commercial providers and many of the larger wind developers have in-house modeling capabilities The total amount of economically extractable power available from the wind is considerably more than present human power use from all sources The strength of wind varies and an average value for a given location does not alone indicate the amount of energy a wind turbine could produce there To assess prospective wind power sites a probability distribution function is often fit to the observed wind speed data Different locations will have different wind speed distributions The Weibull model closely mirrors the actual distribution of hourly ten-minute wind speeds at many locations The Weibull factor is often close to and therefore a Rayleigh distribution can be used as a less accurate but simpler model Wind farms Main articles Wind farm and List of onshore wind farms Large onshore wind farms Wind farm Capacity MW Country Refs Gansu Wind Farm China Muppandal Wind Farm India Alta Oak Creek-Mojave United States Jaisalmer Wind Park India A wind farm is a group of wind turbines in the same location A large wind farm may consist of several hundred individual wind turbines distributed over an extended area The land between the turbines may be used for agricultural or other purposes A wind farm may also be located offshore Almost all large wind turbines have the same design a horizontal axis wind turbine having an upwind rotor with blades attached to a nacelle on top of a tall tubular tower In a wind farm individual turbines are interconnected with a medium voltage often kV power collection system and communications network In general a distance of D times the rotor diameter of the wind turbine is set between each turbine in a fully developed wind farm At a substation this medium-voltage electric current is increased in voltage with a transformer for connection to the high voltage electric power transmission system Generator characteristics and stability Most modern turbines use variable speed generators combined with either a partial or full-scale power converter between the turbine generator and the collector system which generally have more desirable properties for grid interconnection and have low voltage ride through -capabilities Modern turbines use either doubly fed electric machines with partial-scale converters or squirrel-cage induction generators or synchronous generators both permanently and electrically excited with full-scale converters Black start is possible and is being further developed for places such as Iowa which generate most of their electricity from wind Transmission system operators will supply a wind farm developer with a grid code to specify the requirements for interconnection to the transmission grid This will include the power factor the constancy of frequency and the dynamic behaviour of the wind farm turbines during a system fault Offshore wind power The world s second full-scale floating wind turbine and first to be installed without the use of heavy-lift vessels WindFloat operating at rated capacity MW approximately km offshore of P voa de Varzim Portugal Offshore windfarms including floating windfarms provide a small but growing fraction of total windfarm power generation Such power generation capacity must grow substantially to help meet the IEA s Net Zero by pathway to combat climate change Main articles Offshore wind power and List of offshore wind farms Offshore wind power is wind farms in large bodies of water usually the sea These installations can use the more frequent and powerful winds that are available in these locations and have less visual impact on the landscape than land-based projects However the construction and maintenance costs are considerably higher As of November the Hornsea Wind Farm in the United Kingdom is the largest offshore wind farm in the world at MW Collection and transmission network Near offshore wind farms may be connected by AC and far offshore by HVDC Wind power resources are not always located near areas with a high population density As transmission lines become longer the losses associated with power transmission increase as modes of losses at lower lengths are exacerbated and new modes of losses are no longer negligible as the length is increased making it harder to transport large loads over large distances When the transmission capacity does not meet the generation capacity wind farms are forced to produce below their full potential or stop running altogether in a process known as curtailment While this leads to potential renewable generation left untapped it prevents possible grid overload or risk to reliable service One of the biggest current challenges to wind power grid integration in some countries is the necessity of developing new transmission lines to carry power from wind farms usually in remote lowly populated areas due to availability of wind to high load locations usually on the coasts where population density is higher Any existing transmission lines in remote locations may not have been designed for the transport of large amounts of energy In particular geographic regions peak wind speeds may not coincide with peak demand for electrical power whether offshore or onshore A possible future option may be to interconnect widely dispersed geographic areas with an HVDC super grid Wind power capacity and production Main articles Wind power by country and Wind power industry In wind supplied over TWh of electricity which was of world electricity Growth trends Renewable energy sources especially solar photovoltaic and wind power are providing an increasing share of power capacity Wind energy generation by region Wind generation by country Number of countries with wind capacities in the gigawatt-scale by year Growing number of wind gigawatt-markets Above -GW mark Above -GW mark Above -GW mark To help meet the Paris Agreement s goals to limit climate change analysts say it should expand much faster than it currently is by over of electricity generation per year Expansion of wind power is being hindered by fossil fuel subsidies The actual amount of electric power that wind can generate is calculated by multiplying the nameplate capacity by the capacity factor which varies according to equipment and location Estimates of the capacity factors for wind installations are in the range of to Capacity factor Since wind speed is not constant a wind farm s annual energy production is never as much as the sum of the generator nameplate ratings multiplied by the total hours in a year The ratio of actual productivity in a year to this theoretical maximum is called the capacity factor Online data is available for some locations and the capacity factor can be calculated from the yearly output Penetration Wind energy penetration is the fraction of energy produced by wind compared with the total generation Wind power s share of worldwide electricity usage in was almost up from in There is no generally accepted maximum level of wind penetration The limit for a particular grid will depend on the existing generating plants pricing mechanisms capacity for energy storage demand management and other factors An interconnected electric power grid will already include reserve generating and transmission capacity to allow for equipment failures This reserve capacity can also serve to compensate for the varying power generation produced by wind stations Studies have indicated that of the total annual electrical energy consumption may be incorporated with minimal difficulty These studies have been for locations with geographically dispersed wind farms some degree of dispatchable energy or hydropower with storage capacity demand management and interconnected to a large grid area enabling the export of electric power when needed Electrical utilities continue to study the effects of large-scale penetration of wind generation on system stability A wind energy penetration figure can be specified for different duration of time but is often quoted annually To generate almost all electricity from wind annually requires substantial interconnection to other systems for example some wind power in Scotland is sent to the rest of the British grid On a monthly weekly daily or hourly basis or less wind might supply as much as or more than of current use with the rest stored exported or curtailed The seasonal industry might then take advantage of high wind and low usage times such as at night when wind output can exceed normal demand Such industry might include the production of silicon aluminum steel or natural gas and hydrogen and using future long-term storage to facilitate energy from variable renewable energy better source needed Homes and businesses can also be programmed to vary electricity demand for example by remotely turning up water heater thermostats Variability Main article Variable renewable energy Further information Grid balancing Wind turbines are typically installed in windy locations In the image wind power generators in Spain near an Osborne bull Roscoe Wind Farm an onshore wind farm in West Texas near Roscoe Wind power is variable and during low wind periods it may need to be replaced by other power sources Transmission networks presently cope with outages of other generation plants and daily changes in electrical demand but the variability of intermittent power sources such as wind power is more frequent than those of conventional power generation plants which when scheduled to be operating may be able to deliver their nameplate capacity around of the time Electric power generated from wind power can be highly variable at several different timescales hourly daily or seasonally Annual variation also exists but is not as significant citation needed Because instantaneous electrical generation and consumption must remain in balance to maintain grid stability this variability can present substantial challenges to incorporating large amounts of wind power into a grid system Intermittency and the non- dispatchable nature of wind energy production can raise costs for regulation incremental operating reserve and at high penetration levels could require an increase in the already existing energy demand management load shedding storage solutions or system interconnection with HVDC cables Fluctuations in load and allowance for the failure of large fossil-fuel generating units require operating reserve capacity which can be increased to compensate for the variability of wind generation Utility-scale batteries are often used to balance hourly and shorter timescale variation but car batteries may gain ground from the mid- s Wind power advocates argue that periods of low wind can be dealt with by simply restarting existing power stations that have been held in readiness or interlinking with HVDC The combination of diversifying variable renewables by type and location forecasting their variation and integrating them with dispatchable renewables flexible fueled generators and demand response can create a power system that has the potential to meet power supply needs reliably Integrating ever-higher levels of renewables is being successfully demonstrated in the real world Seasonal cycle of capacity factors for wind and photovoltaics in Europe under idealized assumptions The figure illustrates the balancing effects of wind and solar energy at the seasonal scale Kaspar et al Solar power tends to be complementary to wind On daily to weekly timescales high-pressure areas tend to bring clear skies and low surface winds whereas low-pressure areas tend to be windier and cloudier On seasonal timescales solar energy peaks in summer whereas in many areas wind energy is lower in summer and higher in winter A Thus the seasonal variation of wind and solar power tend to cancel each other somewhat Wind hybrid power systems are becoming more popular Predictability Main article Wind power forecasting For any particular generator there is an chance that wind output will change less than in an hour and a chance that it will change or more in hours In summer wind power in the United Kingdom fell due to the lowest winds in seventy years In the future smoothing peaks by producing green hydrogen may help when wind has a larger share of generation While the output from a single turbine can vary greatly and rapidly as local wind speeds vary as more turbines are connected over larger and larger areas the average power output becomes less variable and more predictable Weather forecasting permits the electric-power network to be readied for the predictable variations in production that occur It is thought that the most reliable low-carbon electricity systems will include a large share of wind power Energy storage Main article Grid energy storage See also List of energy storage projects Energy from wind sunlight or other renewable energy is converted to potential energy for storage in devices such as electric batteries or higher-elevation water reservoirs The stored potential energy is later converted to electricity that is added to the power grid even when the original energy source is not available Typically conventional hydroelectricity complements wind power very well When the wind is blowing strongly nearby hydroelectric stations can temporarily hold back their water When the wind drops they can provided they have the generation capacity rapidly increase production to compensate This gives a very even overall power supply and virtually no loss of energy and uses no more water Alternatively where a suitable head of water is not available pumped-storage hydroelectricity or other forms of grid energy storage such as compressed air energy storage and thermal energy storage can store energy developed by high-wind periods and release it when needed The type of storage needed depends on the wind penetration level low penetration requires daily storage and high penetration requires both short- and long-term storage as long as a month or more citation needed Stored energy increases the economic value of wind energy since it can be shifted to displace higher-cost generation during peak demand periods The potential revenue from this arbitrage can offset the cost and losses of storage Although pumped-storage power systems are only about efficient and have high installation costs their low running costs and ability to reduce the required electrical base-load can save both fuel and total electrical generation costs Energy payback The energy needed to build a wind farm divided into the total output over its life Energy Return on Energy Invested of wind power varies but averages about Thus the energy payback time is typically around a year Economics Onshore wind cost per kilowatt-hour between and Onshore wind is an inexpensive source of electric power cheaper than coal plants and new gas plants According to BusinessGreen wind turbines reached grid parity the point at which the cost of wind power matches traditional sources in some areas of Europe in the mid- s and in the US around the same time Falling prices continue to drive the Levelized cost down and it has been suggested that it has reached general grid parity in Europe in and will reach the same point in the US around due to an expected reduction in capital costs of about needs update In the CEO of Siemens Gamesa warned that increased demand for low-cost wind turbines combined with high input costs and high costs of steel result in increased pressure on the manufacturers and decreasing profit margins Northern Eurasia Canada some parts of the United States and Patagonia in Argentina are the best areas for onshore wind whereas in other parts of the world solar power or a combination of wind and solar tend to be cheaper Electric power cost and trends A turbine blade convoy passing through Edenfield in the U K Even longer -piece blades are now manufactured and then assembled on-site to reduce difficulties in transportation See also Cost of electricity by source Wind power is capital intensive but has no fuel costs The price of wind power is therefore much more stable than the volatile prices of fossil fuel sources However the estimated average cost per unit of electric power must incorporate the cost of construction of the turbine and transmission facilities borrowed funds return to investors including the cost of risk estimated annual production and other components averaged over the projected useful life of the equipment which may be more than years Energy cost estimates are highly dependent on these assumptions so published cost figures can differ substantially The presence of wind energy even when subsidized can reduce costs for consumers billion yr in Germany by reducing the marginal price and by minimizing the use of expensive peaking power plants The cost has decreased as wind turbine technology has improved There are now longer and lighter wind turbine blades improvements in turbine performance and increased power generation efficiency Also wind project capital expenditure costs and maintenance costs have continued to decline In a Lazard study of unsubsidized electricity said that wind power levelized cost of electricity continues to fall but more slowly than before The study estimated new wind-generated electricity cost from to MWh compared to new gas power from to MWh The median cost of fully deprecated existing coal power was MWh nuclear MWh and gas MWh The study estimated offshore wind at around MWh Compound annual growth rate was per year from to compared to per year from to The value of wind power While the levelised costs of wind power may have reached that of traditional combustion based power technologies the market value of the generated power is also lower due to the merit order effect which implies that electricity market prices are lower in hours with substantial generation of variable renewable energy due to the low marginal costs of this technology The effect has been identified in several European markets For wind power plants exposed to electricity market pricing in markets with high penetration of variable renewable energy sources profitability can be challenged Incentives and community benefits Turbine prices have fallen significantly in recent years due to tougher competitive conditions such as the increased use of energy auctions and the elimination of subsidies in many markets As of subsidies are still often given to offshore wind However they are generally no longer necessary for onshore wind in countries with even a very low carbon price such as China provided there are no competing fossil fuel subsidies Secondary market forces provide incentives for businesses to use wind-generated power even if there is a premium price for the electricity For example socially responsible manufacturers pay utility companies a premium that goes to subsidize and build new wind power infrastructure Companies use wind-generated power and in return they can claim that they are undertaking strong green efforts Wind projects provide local taxes or payments in place of taxes and strengthen the economy of rural communities by providing income to farmers with wind turbines on their land The wind energy sector can also produce jobs during the construction and operating phase Jobs include the manufacturing of wind turbines and the construction process which includes transporting installing and then maintaining the turbines An estimated million people were employed in wind power in Small-scale wind power Main article Small wind turbine Further information Microgeneration A small Quietrevolution QR Gorlov type vertical axis wind turbine on the roof of Bristol Beacon in Bristol England Measuring m in diameter and m high it has a nameplate rating of kW Small-scale wind power is the name given to wind generation systems with the capacity to produce up to kW of electrical power Isolated communities that may otherwise rely on diesel generators may use wind turbines as an alternative Individuals may purchase these systems to reduce or eliminate their dependence on grid electric power for economic reasons or to reduce their carbon footprint Wind turbines have been used for household electric power generation in conjunction with battery storage over many decades in remote areas Examples of small-scale wind power projects in an urban setting can be found in New York City where since several building projects have capped their roofs with Gorlov-type helical wind turbines Although the energy they generate is small compared to the buildings overall consumption they help to reinforce the building s green credentials in ways that showing people your high-tech boiler cannot with some of the projects also receiving the direct support of the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority Grid-connected domestic wind turbines may use grid energy storage thus replacing purchased electric power with locally produced power when available The surplus power produced by domestic microgenerators can in some jurisdictions be fed into the network and sold to the utility company producing a retail credit for the microgenerators owners to offset their energy costs Off-grid system users can either adapt to intermittent power or use batteries photovoltaic or diesel systems to supplement the wind turbine Equipment such as parking meters traffic warning signs street lighting or wireless Internet gateways may be powered by a small wind turbine possibly combined with a photovoltaic system that charges a small battery replacing the need for a connection to the power grid Airborne wind turbines such as kites can be used in places at risk of hurricanes as they can be taken down in advance Impact on environment and landscape Main article Environmental impact of wind power Greenhouse gas emissions per energy source Wind energy is one of the sources with the least greenhouse gas emissions Collisions with wind turbines are a minor source of bird mortality compared to other human causes The environmental impact of electricity generation from wind power is minor when compared to that of fossil fuel power Wind turbines have some of the lowest life-cycle greenhouse-gas emissions of energy sources far less greenhouse gas is emitted than for the average unit of electricity so wind power helps limit climate change Use of engineered wood may allow carbon negative wind power Wind power consumes no fuel and emits no local air pollution unlike fossil fuel power sources Onshore wind farms can have a significant visual impact Due to a very low surface power density and spacing requirements wind farms typically need to be spread over more land than other power stations Their network of turbines access roads transmission lines and substations can result in energy sprawl although land between the turbines and roads can still be used for agriculture Some wind farms are opposed for potentially spoiling protected scenic areas archaeological landscapes and heritage sites A report by the Mountaineering Council of Scotland concluded that wind farms harmed tourism in areas known for natural landscapes and panoramic views Habitat loss and fragmentation are the greatest potential impacts on wildlife of onshore wind farms but the worldwide ecological impact is minimal Thousands of birds and bats including rare species have been killed by wind turbine blades though wind turbines are responsible for far fewer bird deaths than fossil-fueled power stations when climate change effects are included The effects of wind turbines on birds can be mitigated with proper wildlife monitoring Many wind turbine blades are made of fiberglass and have a lifetime of years Blades are hollow some blades are crushed to reduce their volume and then landfilled However as they can take a lot of weight they can be made into long lasting small bridges for walkers or cyclists Blade end-of-life is complicated and blades manufactured in the s are more likely to be designed to be completely recyclable Wind turbines also generate noise At a distance of metres ft this may be around dB which is slightly louder than a refrigerator At km mi they become inaudible There are anecdotal reports of negative health effects on people who live very close to wind turbines Peer-reviewed research has generally not supported these claims Politics Central government Although wind turbines with fixed bases are a mature technology and new installations are generally no longer subsidized floating wind turbines are a relatively new technology so some governments subsidize them for example to use deeper waters Fossil fuel subsidies by some governments are slowing the growth of renewables Permitting of wind farms can take years and some governments are trying to speed up the wind industry says this will help limit climate change and increase energy security sometimes groups such as fishers resist this but governments say that rules protecting biodiversity will still be followed Public opinion Acceptance of wind and solar facilities in one s community is stronger among U S Democrats blue while acceptance of nuclear power plants is stronger among U S Republicans red Surveys of public attitudes across Europe and in many other countries show strong public support for wind power Bakker et al found in their study that residents who did not want turbines built near them suffered significantly more stress than those who benefited economically from wind turbines Although wind power is a popular form of energy generation onshore or near offshore wind farms are sometimes opposed for their impact on the landscape especially scenic areas heritage areas and archaeological landscapes as well as noise and impact on tourism In other cases there is direct community ownership of wind farms The hundreds of thousands of people who have become involved in Germany s small and medium-sized wind farms demonstrate such support there A Harris Poll found strong support for wind power in Germany other European countries and the United States Public support in the United States has decreased from in to in with the Democratic Party supporting the use of wind energy twice as much as the Republican Party President Biden has signed an executive order to begin building large scale wind farms In China Shen et al found that Chinese city-dwellers may be resistant to building wind turbines in urban areas with a surprisingly high proportion of people citing an unfounded fear of radiation as driving their concerns Also the study finds that like their counterparts in OECD countries urban Chinese respondents are sensitive to direct costs and wildlife externalities Distributing relevant information about turbines to the public may alleviate resistance Community See also Community debate about wind farms Wind turbines such as these in Cumbria England have been opposed for a number of reasons including aesthetics by some sectors of the population Many wind power companies work with local communities to reduce environmental and other concerns associated with particular wind farms In other cases there is direct community ownership of wind farm projects Appropriate government consultation planning and approval procedures also help to minimize environmental risks Some may still object to wind farms but many say their concerns should be weighed against the need to address the threats posed by air pollution climate change and the opinions of the broader community In the US wind power projects are reported to boost local tax bases helping to pay for schools roads and hospitals and to revitalize the economies of rural communities by providing steady income to farmers and other landowners In the UK both the National Trust and the Campaign to Protect Rural England have expressed concerns about the effects on the rural landscape caused by inappropriately sited wind turbines and wind farms A panoramic view of the United Kingdom s Whitelee Wind Farm with Lochgoin Reservoir in the foreground Some wind farms have become tourist attractions The Whitelee Wind Farm Visitor Centre has an exhibition room a learning hub a caf with a viewing deck and also a shop It is run by the Glasgow Science Centre In Denmark a loss-of-value scheme gives people the right to claim compensation for loss of value of their property if it is caused by proximity to a wind turbine The loss must be at least of the property s value Despite this general support for the concept of wind power in the public at large local opposition often exists and has delayed or aborted a number of projects As well as concerns about the landscape there are concerns that some installations can produce excessive sound and vibration levels leading to a decrease in property values A study of home sales near wind turbines found no statistical evidence that prices were affected While aesthetic issues are subjective and some find wind farms pleasant and optimistic or symbols of energy independence and local prosperity protest groups are often formed to attempt to block some wind power stations for various reasons Some opposition to wind farms is dismissed as NIMBYism but research carried out in found that there is little evidence to support the belief that residents only object to wind farms because of a Not in my Back Yard attitude Geopolitics Wind

control Rotor hub Typical components of a wind turbine gearbox rotor shaft and brake assembly being lifted into position Wind turbines are devices that convert the wind s kinetic energy into electrical power The result of over a millennium of windmill development and modern engineering today s wind turbines are manufactured in a wide range of horizontal axis and vertical axis types The smallest turbines are used for applications such as battery charging for auxiliary power Slightly larger turbines can be used for making small contributions to a domestic power supply while selling unused power back to the utility supplier via the electrical grid Arrays of large turbines known as wind farms have become an increasingly important source of renewable energy and are used by many countries to reduce their reliance on fossil fuels Wind turbine design is the process of defining the form and specifications of a wind turbine to extract energy from the wind A wind turbine installation consists of the necessary systems needed to capture the wind s energy point the turbine into the wind convert mechanical rotation into electrical power and other systems to start stop and control the turbine In the German physicist Albert Betz showed that for a hypothetical ideal wind-energy extraction machine the fundamental laws of conservation of mass and energy allowed no more than of the kinetic energy of the wind to be captured This Betz limit can be approached in modern turbine designs which may reach to of the theoretical Betz limit The aerodynamics of a wind turbine are not straightforward The airflow at the blades is not the same as the airflow far away from the turbine The very nature of how energy is extracted from the air also causes air to be deflected by the turbine This affects the objects or other turbines downstream which is known as wake effect Also the aerodynamics of a wind turbine at the rotor surface exhibit phenomena that are rarely seen in other aerodynamic fields The shape and dimensions of the blades of the wind turbine are determined by the aerodynamic performance required to efficiently extract energy from the wind and by the strength required to resist the forces on the blade In addition to the aerodynamic design of the blades the design of a complete wind power system must also address the design of the installation s rotor hub nacelle tower structure generator controls and foundation History Main article History of wind power Charles F Brush s wind turbine of used for generating electric power See also Renewable energy commercialization Wind power Wind power has been used as long as humans have put sails into the wind Wind-powered machines used to grind grain and pump water the windmill and wind pump were developed in what is now Iran Afghanistan and Pakistan by the th century Wind power was widely available and not confined to the banks of fast-flowing streams or later requiring sources of fuel Wind-powered pumps drained the polders of the Netherlands and in arid regions such as the American mid-west or the Australian outback wind pumps provided water for livestock and steam engines The first wind turbine used for the production of electric power was built in Scotland in July by Prof James Blyth of Anderson s College Glasgow the precursor of Strathclyde University Blyth s metres ft high cloth-sailed wind turbine was installed in the garden of his holiday cottage at Marykirk in Kincardineshire and was used to charge accumulators developed by the Frenchman Camille Alphonse Faure to power the lighting in the cottage thus making it the first house in the world to have its electric power supplied by wind power Blyth offered the surplus electric power to the people of Marykirk for lighting the main street however they turned down the offer as they thought electric power was the work of the devil Although he later built a wind turbine to supply emergency power to the local Lunatic Asylum Infirmary and Dispensary of Montrose the invention never really caught on as the technology was not considered to be economically viable Across the Atlantic in Cleveland Ohio a larger and heavily engineered machine was designed and constructed in the winter of by Charles F Brush This was built by his engineering company at his home and operated from until The Brush wind turbine had a rotor metres ft in diameter and was mounted on an -metre ft tall tower Although large by today s standards the machine was only rated at kW The connected dynamo was used either to charge a bank of batteries or to operate up to incandescent light bulbs three arc lamps and various motors in Brush s laboratory With the development of electric power wind power found new applications in lighting buildings remote from centrally generated power Throughout the th century parallel paths developed small wind stations suitable for farms or residences From many isolated properties in Australia ran their lighting and electric fans from batteries charged by a Freelite wind-driven generator producing watts of electrical power from as little wind speed as miles per hour km h The oil crisis triggered the investigation in Denmark and the United States that led to larger utility-scale wind generators that could be connected to electric power grids for remote use of power By the U S installed capacity had reached gigawatts and by the installed capacity was gigawatts Today wind-powered generators operate in every size range from tiny stations for battery charging at isolated residences up to gigawatt-sized offshore wind farms that provide electric power to national electrical networks The European Union is working to augment these prospects In the global wind power sector experienced significant growth with gigawatts GW of new capacity added to the power grid representing a increase over the amount added in This surge in capacity brought the total installed wind power

    "content": "Nuclear power proposed as renewable energy - Wikipedia Jump to content From Wikipedia the free encyclopedia Ongoing debate on whether nuclear power is renewable Whether nuclear power should be considered a form of renewable energy is an ongoing subject of debate Statutory definitions of renewable energy usually exclude many present nuclear energy technologies with the notable exception of the U S state of Utah Dictionary-sourced definitions of renewable energy technologies often omit or explicitly exclude mention of nuclear energy sources with an exception made for the natural nuclear decay heat generated within the Earth The most common fuel used in conventional nuclear fission power stations uranium- is non-renewable according to the United States Energy Information Administration the organization however is silent on the recycled MOX fuel The National Renewable Energy Laboratory does not mention nuclear power in its energy basics definition In the Brundtland Commission WCED classified fission reactors that produce more fissile nuclear fuel than they consume breeder reactors and if developed fusion power among conventional renewable energy sources such as solar power and hydropower The monitoring and storage of radioactive waste products is also required upon the use of other renewable energy sources such as geothermal energy Definitions of renewable energy edit Renewable energy alternatives graphic Renewable energy flows involve natural phenomena which with the exception of tidal power ultimately derive their energy from the sun a natural fusion reactor or from geothermal energy which is heat derived in greatest part from that which is generated in the earth from the decay of radioactive isotopes Renewable energy resources exist over wide geographical areas in contrast to other energy sources which are concentrated in a limited number of countries Fission fuel supply edit In the World Commission on Environment and Development WCED an organization independent from but created by the United Nations published Our Common Future in which a particular subset of presently operating nuclear fission technologies and nuclear fusion were both classified as renewable That is fission reactors that produce more fissile fuel than they consume - breeder reactors and when it is developed fusion power are both classified within the same category as conventional renewable energy sources such as solar and falling water To fulfill the conditions required for a nuclear renewable energy concept one has to explore a combination of processes going from the front end of the nuclear fuel cycle to the fuel production and the energy conversion using specific fluid fuels and reactors as reported by Degueldre et al Extraction of uranium from a diluted fluid ore such as seawater has been studied in various countries worldwide This extraction should be carried out parsimoniously as suggested by Degueldre An extraction rate of kilotons of U per year over centuries would not modify significantly the equilibrium concentration of uranium in the oceans ppb This equilibrium results from the input of kilotons of U per year by river waters and its scavenging on the sea floor from the exatons of water in the oceans For a renewable uranium extraction the use of a specific biomass material is suggested to adsorb uranium and subsequently other transition metals The uranium loading on the biomass would be around mg per kg After contact time the loaded material would be dried and burned CO neutral with heat conversion into electricity e g The uranium burning in a molten salt fast reactor helps to optimize the energy conversion by burning all actinide isotopes with an excellent yield for producing a maximum amount of thermal energy from fission and converting it into electricity This optimisation can be reached by reducing the moderation and the fission product concentration in the liquid fuel coolant These effects can be achieved by using a maximum amount of actinides and a minimum amount of alkaline earth alkaline elements yielding a harder neutron spectrum Under these optimal conditions the consumption of natural uranium would be tons per year and per gigawatt GW of produced electricity e g The coupling of uranium extraction from the sea and its optimal utilisation in a molten salt fast reactor should allow nuclear energy to gain the label renewable In addition the amount of seawater used by a nuclear power plant to cool the last coolant fluid and the turbine would be gigatons per year for a fast molten salt reactor corresponding to tons of natural uranium extractable per year This practice justifies the label renewable citation needed Conventional fission edit Proportions of the isotopes U- blue and U- red found in natural uranium versus grades that are enriched light water reactors and the natural uranium capable CANDU reactors are primarily powered only by the U- component failing to extract much energy from U- While by contrast uranium breeder reactors mostly use U- the primary constituent of natural uranium as their fuel Nuclear fission reactors are a natural energy phenomenon having naturally formed on Earth in times past For example a natural nuclear fission reactor which ran for thousands of years in present-day Oklo Gabon was discovered in the s It ran for a few hundred thousand years averaging kW of thermal power during that time Conventional human manufactured nuclear fission power stations largely use uranium a common metal found in seawater and in rocks all over the world as its primary source of fuel Uranium- burnt in conventional reactors without fuel recycling is a non-renewable resource and if used at present rates would eventually be exhausted This is also somewhat similar to the situation with a commonly classified renewable source geothermal energy a form of energy derived from the natural nuclear decay of the large but nonetheless finite supply of uranium thorium and potassium- present within the Earth s crust and due to the nuclear decay process this renewable energy source will also eventually run out of fuel As too will the Sun and be exhausted Breeder reactors edit A cutaway model of the nd most powerful presently operating fast breeder reactor in the world The BN- at MW of nameplate capacity is equivalent in power output to a natural gas CCGT It dispatches MW to the Middle Urals power grid Construction of a second breeder reactor the BN- reactor was completed in Nuclear fission involving breeder reactors a reactor which breeds more fissile fuel than they consume and thereby has a breeding ratio for fissile fuel higher than thus has a stronger case for being considered a renewable resource than conventional fission reactors Breeder reactors would constantly replenish the available supply of nuclear fuel by converting fertile materials such as uranium- and thorium into fissile isotopes of plutonium or uranium- respectively Fertile materials are also nonrenewable but their supply on Earth is extremely large with a supply timeline greater than geothermal energy In a closed nuclear fuel cycle utilizing breeder reactors nuclear fuel could therefore be considered renewable In physicist Bernard Cohen claimed that fast breeder reactors fueled exclusively by natural uranium extracted from seawater could supply energy at least as long as the sun s expected remaining lifespan of five billion years This was based on calculations involving the geological cycles of erosion subduction and uplift leading to humans consuming half of the total uranium in the Earth s crust at an annual usage rate of tonne yr which was enough to produce approximately times the world s electricity consumption and would reduce the concentration of uranium in the seas by resulting in an increase in the price of uranium of less than Advancements at Oak Ridge National Laboratory and the University of Alabama as published in a issue of the American Chemical Society towards the extraction of uranium from seawater have focused on increasing the biodegradability of the materials used reducing the projected cost of the metal if it was extracted from the sea on an industrial scale The researchers improvements include using electrospun Shrimp shell Chitin mats that are more effective at absorbing uranium when compared to the prior record-setting Japanese method of using plastic amidoxime nets As of only a few kilograms picture available of uranium have been extracted from the ocean in pilot programs and it is also believed that the uranium extracted on an industrial scale from the seawater would constantly be replenished from uranium leached from the ocean floor maintaining the seawater concentration at a stable level In with the advances made in the efficiency of seawater uranium extraction a paper in the journal of Marine Science Engineering suggests that with light water reactors as its target the process would be economically competitive if implemented on a large scale In the global effort in the field of research was the subject of a special issue in the journal of Industrial Engineering Chemistry Research As of only breeder reactors are producing industrial quantities of electricity the BN- and BN- The retired French Ph nix reactor also demonstrated a greater than one breeding ratio and operated for years producing power when Our Common Future was published in Fusion fuel supply edit If it is developed fusion power would provide more energy for a given weight of fuel than any fuel-consuming energy source currently in use The fuel itself primarily deuterium exists abundantly in the Earth s ocean about in hydrogen H atoms in seawater H O is deuterium in the form of semi-heavy water Although this may seem a low proportion about because nuclear fusion reactions are so much more energetic than chemical combustion and seawater is easier to access and more plentiful than fossil fuels fusion could potentially supply the world s energy needs for millions of years In the deuterium lithium fusion fuel cycle million years is the estimated supply lifespan of this fusion power if it is possible to extract all the lithium from seawater assuming current world energy consumption While in the second easiest fusion power fuel cycle the deuterium deuterium burn assuming all of the deuterium in seawater was extracted and used there is an estimated billion years of fuel with this again assuming current world energy consumption Legislation in the United States edit If nuclear power were classified as renewable energy or as low-carbon energy additional government support would be available in more jurisdictions and utilities could include nuclear power in their effort to comply with the renewable portfolio standard citation needed In the State of Utah passed the Renewable Energy Development Act which in part defined nuclear power as a form of renewable energy In North Carolina the Senate Bill was passed for fusion energy to be added as a renewable source for clean energy See also edit Life-cycle

deployment of three generations of renewable energy technologies dating back more than years First-generation technologies which are already mature and economically competitive include biomass hydroelectricity geothermal power and heat Second-generation technologies are market-ready and are being deployed at the present time they include solar heating photovoltaics wind power solar thermal power stations and modern forms of bioenergy Third-generation technologies require continued R D efforts in order to make large contributions on a global scale and include advanced biomass gasification hot-dry-rock geothermal power and ocean energy In nearly of new installed electricity generation capacity used renewable energy and the International Energy Agency IEA has predicted that by renewable capacity will meet of global power generation Public policy and political leadership helps to level the playing field and drive the wider acceptance of renewable energy technologies Countries such as Germany Denmark and Spain have led the way in implementing innovative policies which has driven most of the growth over the past decade As of Germany has a commitment to the Energiewende transition to a sustainable energy economy and Denmark has a commitment to renewable energy by There are now countries with renewable energy policy targets Renewable energy continued its rapid growth in providing multiple benefits There was a new record set for installed wind and photovoltaic capacity GW and GW and a new high of US Billion for global renewables investment A key benefit that this investment growth brings is a growth in jobs The top countries for investment in recent years were China Germany Spain the United States Italy and Brazil Renewable energy companies include BrightSource Energy First Solar Gamesa GE Energy Goldwind Sinovel Targray Trina Solar Vestas and Yingli Climate change concerns are also driving increasing growth in the renewable energy industries According to a projection by the IEA solar power generators may produce most of the world s electricity within years reducing harmful greenhouse gas emissions Background edit Global public support for energy sources based on a survey by Ipsos Rationale for renewables edit Climate change pollution and energy insecurity are significant problems and addressing them requires major changes to energy infrastructures Renewable energy technologies are essential contributors to the energy supply portfolio as they contribute to world energy security reduce dependency on fossil fuels and some also provide opportunities for mitigating greenhouse gases Climate-disrupting fossil fuels are being replaced by clean climate-stabilizing non-depletable sources of energy the transition from coal oil and gas to wind solar and geothermal energy is well under way In the old economy energy was produced by burning something oil coal or natural gas leading to the carbon emissions that have come to define our economy The new energy economy harnesses the energy in wind the energy coming from the sun and heat from within the earth itself In international public opinion surveys there is strong support for a variety of methods for addressing the problem of energy supply These methods include promoting renewable sources such as solar power and wind power requiring utilities to use more renewable energy and providing tax incentives to encourage the development and use of such technologies It is expected that renewable energy investments will pay off economically in the long term EU member countries have shown support for ambitious renewable energy goals In Eurobarometer polled the twenty-seven EU member states about the target to increase the share of renewable energy in the EU by percent by Most people in all twenty-seven countries either approved of the target or called for it to go further Across the EU percent thought the proposed goal was about right and percent thought it was too modest In comparison percent said it was too ambitious As of new evidence has emerged that there are considerable risks associated with traditional energy sources and that major changes to the mix of energy technologies is needed Several mining tragedies globally have underscored the human toll of the coal supply chain New EPA initiatives targeting air toxics coal ash and effluent releases highlight the environmental impacts of coal and the cost of addressing them with control technologies The use of fracking in natural gas exploration is coming under scrutiny with evidence of groundwater contamination and greenhouse gas emissions Concerns are increasing about the vast amounts of water used at coal-fired and nuclear power plants particularly in regions of the country facing water shortages Events at the Fukushima nuclear plant have renewed doubts about the ability to operate large numbers of nuclear plants safely over the long term Further cost estimates for next generation nuclear units continue to climb and lenders are unwilling to finance these plants without taxpayer guarantees The REN Global Status Report says that renewable energies are no longer just energy sources but ways to address pressing social political economic and environmental problems Today renewables are seen not only as sources of energy but also as tools to address many other pressing needs including improving energy security reducing the health and environmental impacts associated with fossil and nuclear energy mitigating greenhouse gas emissions improving educational opportunities creating jobs reducing poverty and increasing gender equality Renewables have entered the mainstream Growth of renewables edit Renewable energy capacity has steadily grown led by solar photovoltaic power The countries most reliant on fossil fuels for electricity vary widely on how great a percentage of that electricity is generated from renewables leaving wide variation in renewables growth potential In for the first time more renewable energy than conventional power capacity was added in both the European Union and United States demonstrating a fundamental transition of the world s energy markets towards renewables according to a report released by REN a global renewable energy policy network based in Paris In renewable power consisted about a third of the newly built power generation capacities By the end of total renewable power capacity worldwide exceeded GW up Renewables producing electricity accounted for almost half of the GW of capacity added globally during Wind and solar photovoltaics PV accounted for almost and Based on REN s report renewables contributed percent to our energy consumption and percent to our electricity generation in and respectively This energy consumption is divided as coming from traditional biomass as heat energy non-biomass hydro electricity and electricity from wind solar geothermal and biomass During the five-years from the end of through worldwide renewable energy capacity grew at rates of percent annually for many technologies while actual production grew overall In UN under-secretary general Achim Steiner said The continuing growth in this core segment of the green economy is not happening by chance The combination of government target-setting policy support and stimulus funds is underpinning the renewable industry s rise and bringing the much needed transformation of our global energy system within reach He added Renewable energies are expanding both in terms of investment projects and geographical spread In doing so they are making an increasing contribution to combating climate change countering energy poverty and energy insecurity According to a projection by the International Energy Agency solar power plants may produce most of the world s electricity within years significantly reducing the emissions of greenhouse gases that harm the environment The IEA has said Photovoltaic and solar-thermal plants may meet most of the world s demand for electricity by and half of all energy needs with wind hydropower and biomass plants supplying much of the remaining generation Photovoltaic and concentrated solar power together can become the major source of electricity Selected renewable energy global indicators Investment Investment in new renewable capacity

Source REN In China led the world in renewable energy production with a total capacity of GW mainly from hydroelectric and wind power As of China leads the world in the production and use of wind power solar photovoltaic power and smart grid technologies generating almost as much water wind and solar energy as all of France and Germany s power plants combined China s renewable energy sector is growing faster than its fossil fuels and nuclear power capacity Since production of solar cells in China has expanded -fold As Chinese renewable manufacturing has grown the costs of renewable energy technologies have dropped Innovation has helped but the main driver of reduced costs has been market expansion See also renewable energy in the United States for US-figures Economic trends edit Costs of producing renewable energy declined significantly with of total renewable power generation added in having lower costs than the cheapest new fossil fuel option Renewable energy technologies are getting cheaper through technological change and through the benefits of mass production and market competition A IEA report said A portfolio of renewable energy technologies is becoming cost-competitive in an increasingly broad range of circumstances in some cases providing investment opportunities without the need for specific economic support and added that cost reductions in critical technologies such as wind and solar are set to continue As of update there have been substantial reductions in the cost of solar and wind technologies The price of PV modules per MW has fallen by percent since the summer of according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance estimates putting solar power for the first time on a competitive footing with the retail price of electricity in a number of sunny countries Wind turbine prices have also fallen by percent per MW in the last two years reflecting as with solar fierce competition in the supply chain Further improvements in the levelised cost of energy for solar wind and other technologies lie ahead posing a growing threat to the dominance of fossil fuel generation sources in the next few years Hydro-electricity and geothermal electricity produced at favourable sites are now the cheapest way to generate electricity Renewable energy costs continue to drop and the levelised cost of electricity LCOE is declining for wind power solar photovoltaic PV concentrated solar power CSP and some biomass technologies Renewable energy is also the most economic solution for new grid-connected capacity in areas with good resources As the cost of renewable power falls the scope of economically viable applications increases Renewable technologies are now often the most economic solution for new generating capacity Where oil-fired generation is the predominant power generation source e g on islands off-grid and in some countries a lower-cost renewable solution almost always exists today As of renewable power generation technologies accounted for around half of all new power generation capacity additions globally In additions included gigawatt GW of new wind power capacity GW of PV GW of hydro-electricity GW of biomass GW of CSP and GW of geothermal power Three generations of technologies edit Renewable energy includes a number of sources and technologies at different stages of commercialization The International Energy Agency IEA has defined three generations of renewable energy technologies reaching back over years First-generation technologies emerged from the industrial revolution at the end of the th century and include hydropower biomass combustion geothermal power and heat These technologies are quite widely used Second-generation technologies include solar heating and cooling wind power modern forms of bioenergy and solar photovoltaics These are now entering markets as a result of research development and demonstration RD D investments since the s Initial investment was prompted by energy security concerns linked to the oil crises of the s but the enduring appeal of these technologies is due at least in part to environmental benefits Many of the technologies reflect significant advancements in materials Third-generation technologies are still under development and include advanced biomass gasification biorefinery technologies concentrating solar thermal power hot-dry-rock geothermal power and ocean energy Advances in nanotechnology may also play a major role First-generation technologies are well established second-generation technologies are entering markets and third-generation technologies heavily depend on long-term research and development commitments where the public sector has a role to play First-generation technologies edit Biomass heating plant in Austria The total heat power is about kW First-generation technologies are widely used in locations with abundant resources Their future use depends on the exploration of the remaining resource potential particularly in developing countries and on overcoming challenges related to the environment and social acceptance Biomass edit Biomass the burning of organic materials for heat and power is a fully mature technology Unlike most renewable sources biomass and hydropower can supply stable base load power generation Biomass produces CO emissions on combustion and the issue of whether biomass is carbon neutral is contested Material directly combusted in cook stoves produces pollutants leading to severe health and environmental consequences Improved cook stove programs are alleviating some of these effects The industry remained relatively stagnant over the decade to but demand for biomass mostly wood continues to grow in many developing countries as well as Brazil and Germany The economic viability of biomass is dependent on regulated tariffs due to high costs of infrastructure and ingredients for ongoing operations Biomass does offer a ready disposal mechanism by burning municipal agricultural and industrial organic waste products First-generation biomass technologies can be economically competitive but may still require deployment support to overcome public acceptance and small-scale issues As part of the food vs fuel debate several economists from Iowa State University found in there is no evidence to disprove that the primary objective of biofuel policy is to support farm income Hydroelectricity edit The MW Three Gorges Dam in the People s Republic of China the largest hydroelectric power station in the world Hydroelectricity is the term referring to electricity generated by hydropower the production of electrical power through the use of the gravitational force of falling or flowing water In hydropower generated of the worlds total electricity and of all renewable electricity and is expected to increase about each year for the next years Hydroelectric plants have the advantage of being long-lived and many existing plants have operated for more than years Hydropower is produced in countries with the Asia-Pacific region generating percent of global hydropower in China is the largest hydroelectricity producer with terawatt-hours of production in representing around percent of domestic electricity use There are now three hydroelectricity plants larger than GW the Three Gorges Dam in China Itaipu Dam across the Brazil Paraguay border and Guri Dam in Venezuela The cost of hydroelectricity is low making it a competitive source of renewable electricity The average cost of electricity from a hydro plant larger than megawatts is to U S cents per kilowatt-hour Geothermal power and heat edit One of many power plants at The Geysers a geothermal power field in northern California with a total output of over MW Geothermal power plants can operate hours per day providing baseload capacity Estimates for the world potential capacity for geothermal power generation vary widely ranging from GW by to as much as GW Geothermal power capacity grew from around GW in to almost GW in The United States is the world leader in terms of installed capacity representing GW Other countries with significant installed capacity include the Philippines GW Indonesia GW Mexico GW Italy GW Iceland GW Japan GW and New Zealand GW In some countries geothermal power accounts for a significant share of the total electricity supply such as in the Philippines where geothermal represented percent of the total power mix at the end of Geothermal ground source heat pumps represented an estimated GWth of installed capacity at the end of with other direct uses of geothermal heat i e for space heating agricultural drying and other uses reaching an estimated GWth As of update at least countries use direct geothermal energy in some form Second-generation technologies edit Second-generation technologies have gone from being a passion for the dedicated few to a major economic sector in countries such as Germany Spain the United States and Japan Many large industrial companies and financial institutions are involved and the challenge is to broaden the market base for continued growth worldwide Solar heating edit Solar energy technologies such as solar water heaters located on or near the buildings which they supply with energy are a prime example of a soft energy technology See also Solar hot water Solar heating systems are a well known second-generation technology and generally consist of solar thermal collectors a fluid system to move the heat from the collector to its point of usage and a reservoir or tank for heat storage The systems may be used to heat domestic hot water swimming pools or homes and businesses The heat can also be used for industrial process applications or as an energy input for other uses such as cooling equipment In many warmer climates a solar heating system can provide a very high percentage to of domestic hot water energy As of update China has million rooftop solar water heaters Photovoltaics edit Nellis Solar Power Plant at Nellis Air Force Base These panels track the sun in one axis Main articles Photovoltaics and List of photovoltaic power stations President Barack Obama speaks at the DeSoto Next Generation Solar Energy Center Photovoltaic PV cells also called solar cells convert light into electricity In the s and early s most photovoltaic modules were used to provide remote-area power supply but from around industry efforts have focused increasingly on developing building integrated photovoltaics and photovoltaic power stations for grid connected applications Many plants are integrated with agriculture and some use innovative tracking systems that follow the sun s daily path across the sky to generate more electricity than conventional fixed-mounted systems There are no fuel costs or emissions during operation of the power stations Wind power edit Wind power worldwide installed capacity Landowners in the US typically receive to per year in rental income from each wind turbine while farmers continue to grow crops or graze cattle up to the foot of the turbines See also wind power List of onshore wind farms and List of offshore wind farms Some of the second-generation renewables such as wind power have high potential and have already realised relatively low production costs Wind power could become cheaper than nuclear power Global wind power installations increased by MW in bringing total installed capacity up to MW a increase on the MW installed at the end of The increase for represents investments totalling billion US billion and for the first time more than half of all new wind power was added outside of the traditional markets of Europe and North America mainly driven by the continuing boom in China which accounted for nearly half of all of the installations at MW China now has MW of wind power installed Wind power accounts for approximately of electricity generated in Denmark in Spain and Portugal and in Germany and the Republic of Ireland In Australian state of South Australia wind power championed by Premier Mike Rann now comprises of the state s electricity generation edging out coal fired power At the end of South Australia with of Australia s population had of the nation s installed wind power capacity Wind power s share of worldwide electricity usage at the end of was The wind industry is able to produce more power at lower cost by using taller wind turbines with longer blades capturing the faster winds at higher elevations This has opened up new opportunities and in Indiana Michigan and Ohio the price of power from wind turbines built feet to feet above the ground can now compete with conventional fossil fuels like coal Prices have fallen to about cents per kilowatt-hour in some cases and utilities have been increasing the amount of wind energy in their portfolio saying it is their cheapest option Solar thermal power stations edit View of Ivanpah Solar Electric Generating

producing countries for transport biofuels are the US Brazil and the EU Brazil has one of the largest renewable energy programs in the world involving production of ethanol fuel from sugar cane and ethanol now provides percent of the country s automotive fuel As a result of this and the exploitation of domestic deep water oil sources Brazil which for years had to import a large share of the petroleum needed for domestic consumption recently reached complete self-sufficiency in liquid fuels Information on pump California Nearly all the gasoline sold in the United States today is mixed with percent ethanol a mix known as E and motor vehicle manufacturers already produce vehicles designed to run on much higher ethanol blends Ford DaimlerChrysler and GM are among the automobile companies that sell flexible-fuel cars trucks and minivans that can use gasoline and ethanol blends ranging from pure gasoline up to ethanol E The challenge is to expand the market for biofuels beyond the farm states where they have been most popular to date The Energy Policy Act of which calls for billion US gallons m of biofuels to be used annually by will also help to expand the market The growing ethanol and biodiesel industries are providing jobs in plant construction operations and maintenance mostly in rural communities According to the Renewable Fuels Association the ethanol industry created almost U S jobs in alone boosting household income by billion It also contributed about billion in tax revenues at the local state and federal levels Third-generation technologies edit Third-generation renewable energy technologies are still under development and include advanced biomass gasification biorefinery technologies hot-dry-rock geothermal power and ocean energy Third-generation technologies are not yet widely demonstrated or have limited commercialization Many are on the horizon and may have potential comparable to other renewable energy technologies but

Agency cellulosic ethanol biorefineries could allow biofuels to play a much bigger role in the future than organizations such as the IEA previously thought Cellulosic ethanol can be made from plant matter composed primarily of inedible cellulose fibers that form the stems and branches of most plants Crop residues such as corn stalks wheat straw and rice straw wood waste and municipal solid waste are potential sources of cellulosic biomass Dedicated energy crops such as switchgrass are also promising cellulose sources that can be sustainably produced in many regions Ocean energy edit Ocean energy is all forms of renewable energy derived from the sea including wave energy tidal energy river current ocean current energy offshore wind salinity gradient energy and ocean thermal gradient energy The Rance Tidal Power Station MW is the world s first tidal power station The facility is located on the estuary of the Rance River in Brittany France Opened on November it is currently operated by lectricit de France and is the largest tidal power station in the world in terms of installed capacity First proposed more than thirty years ago systems to harvest utility-scale electrical power from ocean waves have recently been gaining momentum as a viable technology The potential for this technology is considered promising especially on west-facing coasts with latitudes between and degrees In the United Kingdom for example the Carbon Trust recently estimated the extent of the economically viable offshore resource at TWh per year about of current national demand Across Europe the technologically achievable resource has been estimated to be at least TWh per year In the U S Electric Power Research Institute EPRI estimated the viable resource in the United States at TWh per year

Technologies The current maximum power output is MW Reedsport Oregon with development underway for MW Coos Bay Oregon Enhanced geothermal systems edit As of update geothermal power development was under way in more than countries partially attributable to the development of new technologies such as Enhanced Geothermal Systems The development of binary cycle power plants and improvements in drilling and extraction technology may enable enhanced geothermal systems over a much greater geographical range than traditional Geothermal systems Demonstration EGS projects are operational in the US Australia Germany France and the United Kingdom Advanced solar concepts edit Beyond the already established solar photovoltaics and solar thermal power technologies are such advanced solar concepts as the solar updraft tower or space-based solar power These concepts have yet to if ever be commercialized See also Solar updraft tower The Solar updraft tower SUT is a renewable-energy power plant for generating electricity from low temperature solar heat Sunshine heats the air beneath a very wide greenhouse-like roofed collector structure surrounding the central base of a very tall chimney tower The resulting convection causes a hot air updraft in the tower by the chimney effect This airflow drives wind turbines placed in the chimney updraft or around the chimney base to produce electricity Plans for scaled-up versions of demonstration models will allow significant power generation and may allow development of other applications such as water extraction or distillation and agriculture or horticulture To view a study on the solar updraft tower and its affects click here A more advanced version of a similarly themed technology is the Vortex engine AVE which aims to replace large physical chimneys with a vortex of air created by a shorter less-expensive structure See also Space-based solar power Space-based solar power SBSP is the concept of collecting solar power in space using an SPS that is a solar-power satellite or a satellite power system for use on Earth It has been in research since the early s SBSP would differ from current solar collection methods in that the means used to collect energy would reside on an orbiting satellite instead of on Earth s surface Some projected benefits of such a system are a higher collection rate and a longer collection period due to the lack of a diffusing atmosphere and night time in space Renewable energy industry edit A Vestas wind turbine Monocrystalline solar cell Total investment in renewable energy

achievement of grid parity for PV These reductions have taken many stakeholders including industry analysts by surprise and perceptions of current solar power economics often lags behind reality Some stakeholders still have the perspective that solar PV remains too costly on an unsubsidized basis to compete with conventional generation options Yet technological advancements manufacturing process improvements and industry re-structuring mean that further price reductions are likely in coming years Non-technical barriers to acceptance edit Acceptance of wind and solar facilities in one s community is stronger among Democrats blue while acceptance of nuclear power plants is stronger among Republicans red Many energy markets institutions and policies have been developed to support the production and use of fossil fuels Newer and cleaner technologies may offer social and environmental benefits but utility operators often reject renewable resources because they are trained to think only in terms of big conventional power plants Consumers often ignore renewable power systems because they are not given accurate price signals about electricity consumption Intentional market distortions such as subsidies and unintentional market distortions such as split incentives may work against renewables Benjamin K Sovacool has argued that some of the most surreptitious yet powerful impediments facing renewable energy and energy efficiency in the United States are more about culture and institutions than engineering and science The obstacles to the widespread commercialization of renewable energy technologies are primarily political not technical and there have been many studies which have identified a range of non-technical barriers to renewable energy use These barriers are impediments which put renewable energy at a marketing institutional or policy disadvantage relative to other forms of energy Key barriers include Difficulty overcoming established energy systems which includes difficulty introducing innovative energy systems particularly for distributed generation such as photovoltaics because of technological lock-in electricity markets designed for centralized power plants and market control by established operators As the Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change points out National grids are usually tailored towards the operation of centralised power plants and thus favour their performance Technologies that do not easily fit into these networks may struggle to enter the market even if the technology itself is commercially viable This applies to distributed generation as most grids are not suited to receive electricity from many small sources Large-scale renewables may also encounter problems if they are sited in areas far from existing grids Lack of government policy support which includes the lack of policies and regulations supporting deployment of renewable energy technologies and the presence of policies and regulations hindering renewable energy development and supporting conventional energy development Examples include subsidies for fossil-fuels insufficient consumer-based renewable energy incentives government underwriting for nuclear plant accidents and complex zoning and permitting processes for renewable energy Lack of information dissemination and consumer awareness Higher capital cost of renewable energy technologies compared with conventional energy technologies Inadequate financing options for renewable energy projects including insufficient access to affordable financing for project developers entrepreneurs and consumers Imperfect capital markets which includes failure to internalize all costs of conventional energy e g effects of air pollution risk of supply disruption and failure to internalize all benefits of renewable energy e g cleaner air energy security Inadequate workforce skills and training which includes lack of adequate scientific technical and manufacturing skills required for renewable energy production lack of reliable installation maintenance and inspection services and failure of the educational system to provide adequate training in new technologies Lack of adequate codes standards utility interconnection and net-metering guidelines Poor public perception of renewable energy system aesthetics Lack of stakeholder community participation and co-operation in energy choices and renewable energy projects With such a wide range of non-technical barriers there is no silver bullet solution to drive the transition to renewable energy So ideally there is a need for several different types of policy instruments to complement each other and overcome different types of barriers A policy framework must be created that will level the playing field and redress the imbalance of traditional approaches associated with fossil fuels The policy landscape must keep pace with broad trends within the energy sector as well as reflecting specific social economic and environmental priorities Some resource-rich countries struggle to move away from fossil fuels and have failed thus far to adopt regulatory frameworks necessary for developing renewable energy e g Russia Public policy landscape edit Public policy has a role to play in renewable energy commercialization because the free market system has some fundamental limitations As the Stern Review points out In a liberalised energy market investors operators and consumers should face the full cost of their decisions But this is not the case in many economies or energy sectors Many policies distort the market in favour of existing fossil fuel technologies The International Solar Energy Society has stated that historical incentives for the conventional energy resources continue even today to bias markets by burying many of the real societal costs of their use Fossil-fuel energy systems have different production transmission and end-use costs and characteristics than do renewable energy systems and new promotional policies are needed to ensure that renewable systems develop as quickly and broadly as is socially desirable Lester Brown states that the market does not incorporate the indirect costs of providing goods or services into prices it does not value nature s services adequately and it does not respect the sustainable-yield thresholds of natural systems It also favors the near term over the long term thereby showing limited concern for future generations Tax and subsidy shifting can help overcome these problems though is also problematic to combine different international normative regimes regulating this issue Shifting taxes edit Tax shifting has been widely discussed and endorsed by economists It involves lowering income taxes while raising levies on environmentally destructive activities in order to create a more responsive market For example a tax on coal that included the increased health care costs associated with breathing polluted air the costs of acid rain damage and the costs of climate disruption would encourage investment in renewable technologies Several Western European countries are already shifting taxes in a process known there as environmental tax reform In Sweden launched a new -year environmental tax shift designed to convert billion kroner billion of income taxes to taxes on environmentally destructive activities Other European countries with significant tax reform efforts are France Italy Norway Spain and the United Kingdom Asia s two leading economies Japan and China are considering carbon taxes Shifting subsidies edit See also Energy subsidies Just as there is a need for tax shifting there is also a need for subsidy shifting Subsidies are not an inherently bad thing as many technologies and industries emerged through government subsidy schemes The Stern Review explains that of key innovations from the past years only one of the was funded entirely by the private sector and nine were totally publicly funded In terms of specific examples the Internet was the result of publicly funded links among computers in government laboratories and research institutes And the combination of the federal tax deduction and a robust state tax deduction in California helped to create the modern wind power industry At the same time specifically US tax credits systems for renewable energy have been described as an opaque financial instrument dominated by large investors to reduce their tax payments while greenhouse gas reduction targets are being treated as a side effect Lester Brown has argued that a world facing the prospect of economically disruptive climate change can no longer justify subsidies to expand the burning of coal and oil Shifting these subsidies to the development of climate-benign energy sources such as wind solar biomass and geothermal power is the key to stabilizing the earth s climate The International Solar Energy Society advocates leveling the playing field by redressing the continuing inequities in public subsidies of energy technologies and R D in which the fossil fuel and nuclear power receive the largest share of financial support Some countries are eliminating or reducing climate-disrupting subsidies and Belgium France and Japan have phased out all subsidies for coal Germany is reducing its coal subsidy The subsidy dropped from billion in to billion in and in the process Germany lowered its coal use by percent China cut its coal subsidy from million in to million in and more recently has imposed a high-sulfur coal tax However the United States has been increasing its support for the fossil fuel and nuclear industries In November an IEA report entitled Deploying Renewables said subsidies in green energy technologies that were not yet competitive are justified in order to give an incentive to investing into technologies with clear environmental and energy security benefits The IEA s report disagreed with claims that renewable energy technologies are only viable through costly subsidies and not able to produce energy reliably to meet demand A fair and efficient imposition of subsidies for renewable energies and aiming at sustainable development however require coordination and regulation at a global level as subsidies granted in one country can easily disrupt industries and policies of others thus underlining the relevance of this issue at the World Trade Organization Renewable energy targets edit Setting national renewable energy targets can be an important part of a renewable energy policy and these targets are usually defined as a percentage of the primary energy and or electricity generation mix For example the European Union has prescribed an indicative renewable energy target of percent of the total EU energy mix and percent of electricity consumption by National targets for individual EU Member States have also been set to meet the overall target Other developed countries with defined national or regional targets include Australia Canada Israel Japan Korea New Zealand Norway Singapore Switzerland and some US States National targets are also an important component of renewable energy strategies in some developing countries Developing countries with renewable energy targets include China India Indonesia Malaysia the Philippines Thailand Brazil Egypt Mali and South Africa The targets set by many developing countries are quite modest when compared with those in some industrialized countries Renewable energy targets in most countries are indicative and nonbinding but they have assisted government actions and regulatory frameworks The United Nations Environment Program has suggested that making renewable energy targets legally binding could be an important policy tool to achieve higher renewable energy market penetration Levelling the playing field edit The IEA has identified three actions which will allow renewable energy and other clean energy technologies to more effectively compete for private sector capital First energy prices must appropriately reflect the true cost of energy e g through carbon pricing so that the positive and negative impacts of energy production and consumption are fully taken into account Example New UK nuclear plants cost MWh whereas offshore wind farms in the UK are supported with MWh at a price of in falling to per MWh in In Denmark the price can be MWh Second inefficient fossil fuel subsidies must be removed while ensuring that all citizens have access to affordable energy Third governments must develop policy frameworks that encourage private sector investment in lower-carbon energy options Green stimulus programs edit In response to the Great Recession major governments made green stimulus programs one of their main policy instruments for supporting economic recovery Some US billion in green stimulus funding had been allocated to renewable energy and energy efficiency to be spent mainly in and in Energy sector regulation edit Public policy determines the extent to which renewable energy RE is to be incorporated into a developed or developing country s generation mix Energy sector regulators implement that policy thus affecting the pace and pattern of RE investments and connections to the grid Energy regulators often have authority to carry out a number of functions that have implications for the financial feasibility of renewable energy projects Such functions include issuing licenses setting performance standards monitoring the performance of regulated firms determining the price level and structure of tariffs establishing uniform systems of accounts arbitrating stakeholder disputes like interconnection cost allocations performing management audits developing agency human resources expertise reporting sector and commission activities to government authorities and coordinating decisions with other government agencies Thus regulators make a wide range of decisions that affect the financial outcomes associated with RE investments In addition the sector regulator is in a position to give advice to the government regarding the full implications of focusing on climate change or energy security The energy sector regulator is the natural advocate for efficiency and cost-containment throughout the process of designing and implementing RE policies Since policies are not self-implementing energy sector regulators become a key facilitator or blocker of renewable energy investments Energy transition in Germany edit This section needs to be updated The reason given is Describes situation from s with early promises such as closure of coal power plants when in reality new coal and gas plants are being built and Energiewende targets for have been missed The original article is more up to date so an excerpt template could be used Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information February Photovoltaic array and wind turbines at the Schneebergerhof wind farm in the German state of Rheinland-Pfalz Gross generation of electricity by source in Germany The Energiewende German for energy transition is the transition by Germany to a low carbon environmentally sound reliable and affordable energy supply The new system will rely heavily on renewable energy particularly wind photovoltaics and biomass energy efficiency and energy demand management Most if not all existing coal-fired generation will need to be retired The phase-out of Germany s fleet of nuclear reactors to be complete by is a key part of the program Legislative support for the Energiewende was passed in late and includes greenhouse gas GHG reductions of by relative to and a renewable energy target of by These targets are ambitious The Berlin-based policy institute Agora Energiewende noted that while the German approach is not unique worldwide the speed and scope of the Energiewende are exceptional The Energiewende also seeks a greater transparency in relation to national energy policy formation Germany has made significant progress on its GHG emissions reduction target achieving a decrease between and However Germany will need to maintain an average GHG emissions abatement rate of per annum to reach its Energiewende goal equal to the maximum historical value thus far Germany spends billion per annum on energy research figure in an effort to solve the technical and social issues raised by the transition This includes a number of computer studies that have confirmed the feasibility and a similar cost relative to business-as-usual and given that carbon is adequately priced of the Energiewende These initiatives go well beyond European Union legislation and the national policies of other European states The policy objectives have been embraced by the German federal government and has resulted in a huge expansion of renewables particularly wind power Germany s share of renewables has increased from around in to in surpassing the OECD average of usage of renewables Producers have been guaranteed a fixed feed-in tariff for years guaranteeing a fixed income Energy co-operatives have been created and efforts were made to decentralize control and profits The large energy companies have a disproportionately small share of the renewables market However in some cases poor investment designs have caused bankruptcies and low returns and unrealistic promises have been shown to be far from reality Nuclear power plants were closed and the existing nine plants will close earlier than planned in One factor that has inhibited efficient employment of new renewable energy has been the lack of an accompanying investment in power infrastructure to bring the power to market It is believed km of power lines must be built or upgraded The different German States have varying attitudes to the construction of new power lines Industry has had their rates frozen and so the increased costs of the Energiewende have been passed on to consumers who have had rising electricity bills Voluntary market mechanisms for renewable electricity edit Voluntary markets also referred to as green power markets are driven by consumer preference Voluntary markets allow a consumer to choose to do more than policy decisions require and reduce the environmental impact of their electricity use Voluntary green power products must offer a significant benefit and value to buyers to be successful Benefits may include zero or reduced greenhouse gas emissions other pollution reductions or other environmental improvements on power stations The driving factors behind voluntary green electricity within the EU are the liberalized electricity markets and the RES Directive According to the directive the EU Member States must ensure that the origin of electricity produced from renewables can be guaranteed and therefore a guarantee of origin must be issued article Environmental organisations are using the voluntary market to create new renewables and improving sustainability of the existing power production In the US the main tool to track and stimulate voluntary actions is Green-e program managed by Center for Resource Solutions Globally available voluntary tool used by the NGOs to promote sustainable electricity production is EKOenergy label Recent developments edit This section needs to be updated Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information August A number of events in pushed renewable energy up the political agenda including the US mid-term elections in November which confirmed clean energy as a mainstream issue Also in the Stern Review made a strong economic case for investing in low carbon technologies now and argued that economic growth need not be incompatible with cutting energy consumption According to a trend analysis from the United Nations Environment Programme climate change concerns coupled with recent high oil prices and increasing government support are driving increasing rates of investment in the renewable energy and energy efficiency industries Investment capital flowing into renewable energy reached a record US billion in with the upward trend continuing in The OECD still dominates but there is now increasing activity from companies in China India and Brazil Chinese companies were the second largest recipient of venture capital in after the United States In the same year India was the largest net buyer of companies abroad mainly in the more established European markets New government spending regulation and policies helped the industry weather the economic crisis better than many other sectors Most notably U S President Barack Obama s American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of included more than billion in direct spending and tax credits for clean energy and associated transportation programs This policy-stimulus combination represents the largest federal commitment in U S history for renewables advanced transportation and energy conservation initiatives Based on these new rules many more utilities strengthened their clean-energy programs Clean Edge suggests that the commercialization of clean energy will help countries around the world deal with the current economic malaise Once-promising solar energy company Solyndra became involved in a political controversy involving U S President Barack Obama s administration s authorization of a million loan guarantee to the Corporation in as part of a program to promote alternative energy growth The company ceased all business activity filed for Chapter bankruptcy and laid-off nearly all of its employees in early September In his January State of the Union address President Barack Obama restated his commitment to renewable energy Obama said that he will not walk away from the promise of clean energy Obama called for a commitment by the Defense Department to purchase MW of renewable energy He also mentioned the long-standing Interior Department commitment to permit MW of renewable energy projects on public land in As of renewable energy plays a major role in the energy mix of many countries globally Renewables are becoming increasingly economic in both developing and developed countries Prices for renewable energy technologies primarily wind power and solar power continued to drop making renewables competitive with conventional energy sources Without a level playing field however high market penetration of renewables is still dependent on robust promotional policies Fossil fuel subsidies which are far higher than those for renewable energy remain in place and quickly need to be phased out United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has said that renewable energy has the ability to lift the poorest nations to new levels of prosperity In October he announced the creation of a high-level group to drum up support for energy access energy efficiency and greater use of renewable energy The group is to be co-chaired by Kandeh Yumkella the chair of UN Energy and director general of the UN Industrial Development Organisation and Charles Holliday chairman of Bank of America Worldwide use of solar power and wind power continued to grow significantly in Solar electricity consumption increased by percent to terawatt-hours TWh Use of wind power in increased by percent to TWh Global solar and wind energy installed capacities continued to expand even though new investments in these technologies declined during Worldwide investment in solar power in was billion an percent decline from and wind power investment was down percent to billion But due to lower production costs for both technologies total installed capacities grew sharply This investment decline but growth in installed capacity may again occur in Analysts expect the market to triple by In investment in renewables exceeded fossils renewable energy edit This section needs to be updated Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information August Main article renewable energy The incentive to use renewable energy for electricity transport or even total primary energy supply globally has been motivated by global warming and other ecological as well as economic concerns In the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change s reviews of scenarios of energy usage that would keep global warming to approximately degrees the proportion of primary energy supplied by renewables increases from in to in median values across all published pathways The proportion of primary energy supplied by biomass increases from to with effective controls on whether land use is changed in the growing of biomass The proportion from wind and solar increases from to At the national level at least nations around the world already have renewable energy contributing more than of energy supply Mark Z Jacobson professor of civil and environmental engineering at Stanford University and director of its Atmosphere and Energy Program says producing all new energy with wind power solar power and hydropower by is feasible and existing energy supply arrangements could be replaced by Barriers to implementing the renewable energy plan are seen to be primarily social and political not technological or economic Jacobson says that energy costs with a wind solar water system should be similar to today s energy costs Renewable projects must be sited at distant locations due to high land prices in urban areas or for the renewable resource itself which require transmission construction costs Similarly in the United States the independent National Research Council has noted that sufficient domestic renewable resources exist to allow renewable electricity to play a significant role in future electricity generation and thus help confront issues related to climate change energy security and the escalation of energy costs Renewable energy is an attractive option because renewable resources available in the United States taken collectively can supply significantly greater amounts of electricity than the total current or projected domestic demand The most significant barriers to the widespread implementation of large-scale renewable energy and low carbon energy strategies are primarily political and not technological According to the Post Carbon Pathways report which reviewed many international studies the key roadblocks are climate change denial the fossil fuels lobby political inaction unsustainable energy consumption outdated energy infrastructure and financial constraints Energy efficiency edit Main article Efficient energy use Moving towards energy sustainability will require changes not only in the way energy is supplied but in the way it is used and reducing the amount of energy required to deliver various goods or services is essential Opportunities for improvement on the demand side of the energy equation are as rich and diverse as those on the supply side and often offer significant economic benefits A sustainable energy economy requires commitments to both renewables and efficiency Renewable energy and energy efficiency are said to be the twin pillars of sustainable energy policy The American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy has explained that both resources must be developed in order to stabilize and reduce carbon dioxide emissions Efficiency is essential to slowing the energy demand growth so that rising clean energy supplies can make deep cuts in fossil fuel use If energy use grows too fast renewable energy development will chase a receding target Likewise unless clean energy supplies come online rapidly slowing demand growth will only begin to reduce total emissions reducing the carbon content of energy sources is also needed The IEA has stated that renewable energy and energy efficiency policies are complementary tools for the development of a sustainable energy future and should be developed together instead of being developed in isolation See also edit Renewable energy portal Global warming portal Environment portal Energy portal Business portal Lists edit Lists about

the credibility of wikipedia edit Although the Yes we should remove them proponents make some good points the No we should not proponents make more and there is a clear consensus not to remove biofuel from this template at this time Regardless of whether biomass and biofuel truly are renewable by definitions X Y or Z it seems clear that keeping them will not damage Wikipedia s credibility though it is likely that removing them wouldn t either If either side wants to make this even more solid the thing to do is to find more scientific studies on this matter not for-the-public articles but actual studies performed by scientists Darkfrog talk September UTC reply The following discussion is closed Please do not modify it Subsequent comments should be made on the appropriate discussion page No further edits should be made to this discussion I know this has been discussed before I would like to bring in a few new editors opinions on whether biomass biofuel could be removed from the template Thank you Brian Everlasting talk August UTC reply No Called by the bot They are renewable energy sources Why remove them Darx url talk August UTC reply No Called by the bot I m vaguely aware of some of the issues surrounding question and understand that some people question the validity of biomass biofeuls as a renewable energy That said it would seem that the gross majority of sources which list types of renewable energy still include biomass on their lists As long as that s true wikipedia should include it too NickCT talk August UTC reply Opposed to the removal not sure why relevant information and relevanrt classification would be removed As for Wikipedia s credibility well that won t suffer many High Schools and damn near all Colleges in the United States at any rate caution their students against using Wikipedia for all the usual reasons Good luck And thank you to the editors working on the project Damotclese talk August UTC reply No Invited by bot Renewable energy sources include plants and animals Renewable energy isn t necessarily clean and non-polluting Joja lozzo August UTC reply Probably no Invited by the bot I d like to see Brian Everlasting make an affirmative case for removal before saying no definitively Protonk talk August UTC reply Having read the case listed below I m less inclined to support this The four points listed while true don t speak to the renewability of the resource Renewable doesn t mean good for the environment It means either that exhausted stock can be replaced or that the stock itself comes from a resource which can t be depleted c f solar Protonk talk August UTC reply No Biomass and biofuel are renewable Concerning the points below the CO released is bound when the biomass grows so there is no net release of CO Likewise burning biomass releases water vapour There is a valid point that specifically peat shouldn t be seen as a renewable biomass but that isn t grounds for removing biomass as a category here And as a procedural aspect any compelling request to remove these categories would have to be accompanied by at least a handful of high-quality sources that dispute their renewability Cheers -- Dailycare talk August UTC reply There are several main reasons why biomass and biofuel should be removed from the template Before I discuss those reasons let me confirm that my previous account User TeH nOmInAtOr has already voiced a few of those reasons Renewable energy is supposed to be good for the environment Burning biomass or biofuel is not clean It produces large amounts of carbon dioxide and other toxic chemical gases comparable to how much would be produced to generate the same amount of energy from coal or gasoline Biomass and biofuel are the only two renewable energies that require consumption of large amounts of water before they can be used Farmers compete with hydroelectric stations for water and what results is the hydroelectric power station produces less hydroelectricity In the Colorado River water is considered a non-renewable resource because water levels continue to decline and Lake Mead is the lowest level it s ever been Farmers are rapidly depleting the unregulated groundwater supplies which exacerbates the problem Land use change is a major contributor to global warming Building a wind farm or solar array requires very little land Biomass and biofuel require large amounts of arable land that usually comes from massive deforestation You can build a wind farm or solar array in a desert because they don t require any water You can t cultivate biomass or biofuel in a desert because it has no water Using biomass and biofuel for energy increases the price of food because less corn is available to eat --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Recommended reading http www motherjones com tom-philpott southwests-water-crunch-even-worse-we-thought Brian Everlasting talk August UTC reply Keep biofuel delete biomass The bot sent me Biomass is just a solid source of biofuel so having them both on the template is redundant like both solar power and solar energy would be I have similar concerns about wave and tidal but I understand there are many sources of waves apart from tides I am aware that most biofuels are renewable but not sustainable except for Brazillian sugarcane-derived ethanol which is sustainable at present but might not be if climate conditions in South America change I share Brian s concerns that almost all biofuels in the English-speaking world could sharply drive up the price of food EllenCT talk August UTC reply No The proposals seems to confuse renewable with sustainable At the same time I think that biofuel should be removed as it is not the energy source but energy carrier Disclosure I came here as this discussion was listed by bot at Wikipedia WikiProject Energy Article alerts Beagel talk August UTC reply I see your point about excluding biofuels but note that the displayed title of the template is Renewable energy so there is ambiguity that we should resolve once this discussion is closed I m inclined towards changing the template title to match the displayed title talk August UTC reply Discussion edit I think those who are in favor of removing renewable energy sources because they pollute or have other negative long-term impacts such as higher food prices are conflating renewable with sustainable This confusion might be prevalent in popular culture but we should not perpetuate that here I think we all can agree that something can be renewable without being sustainable right Joja lozzo August UTC reply I think we need understand and agree that including an energy source in this template doesn t mean it s a good source to include in a sustainable mix of renewable energy sources See Renewable energy debate which is about the suitability acceptability and sustainability of certain renewable resources for deployment Joja lozzo August UTC reply Here s the dictionary reference com definition for renew to begin or take up again as an acquaintance a conversation etc resume to make effective for an additional period to renew a lease to restore or replenish to renew a stock of goods to make say or do again to revive reestablish By renewable energy we mean to say energy which can be used again I would argue that biofuel and biomass are not energy sources but rather energy carriers like hydrogen You wouldn t ask somebody to ride a bike hooked up to a generator to power your lights despite the colloquialism saying that someone is full of energy Biomass and biofuel can be classified as energy carriers like rechargeable batteries Brian Everlasting talk August UTC reply Perhaps I wasn t clear in my discussion of the argument that problems with the sustainability of biofuels and biomass is a reason to exclude them as renewable energy sources because these these new unrelated arguments do not address my points That said this new position is also not well based in policy or sources The dictionary definition of renew is not the definition of renewable energy It is not our role to synthesize the definition of renewable energy from the dictionary definitions of other words We need to use the definition that sources use If the sources include biofuel and biomass then we should also Some here seem comfortable with using their own idea of what renewable energy means but that s inappropriate The exclude biofuels and biomass arguments appear to be based on OR or SYN rather than sources and WP policy Joja lozzo August UTC reply The discussion above is closed Please do not modify it

Skateboarding Walking Watercraft Personal transporter Rail transport Tram Rapid transit Personal rapid transit Category Renewable energy portal v t e Energy is sustainable if it meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs Definitions of sustainable energy usually look at its effects on the environment the economy and society These impacts range from greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution to energy poverty and toxic waste Renewable energy sources such as wind hydro solar and geothermal energy can cause environmental damage but are generally far more sustainable than fossil fuel sources The role of non-renewable energy sources in sustainable energy is controversial Nuclear power does not produce carbon pollution or air pollution but has drawbacks that include radioactive waste the risk of nuclear proliferation and the risk of accidents Switching from coal to natural gas has environmental benefits including a lower climate impact but may lead to a delay in switching to more sustainable options Carbon capture and storage can be built into power plants to remove their carbon dioxide CO emissions but this technology is expensive and has rarely been implemented Fossil fuels provide of the world s energy consumption and the energy system is responsible for of global greenhouse gas emissions Around million people in developing countries lack access to electricity and billion rely on polluting fuels such as wood or charcoal to cook Cooking with biomass plus fossil fuel pollution causes an estimated million deaths each year Limiting global warming to C F will require transforming energy production distribution storage and consumption Universal access to clean electricity can have major benefits to the climate human health and the economies of developing countries Climate change mitigation pathways have been proposed to limit global warming to C F These include phasing out coal-fired power plants conserving energy producing more electricity from clean sources such as wind and solar and switching from fossil fuels to electricity for transport and heating buildings Power output from some renewable energy sources varies depending on when the wind blows and the sun shines Switching to renewable energy can therefore require electrical grid upgrades such as the addition of energy storage Some processes that are difficult to electrify can use hydrogen fuel produced from low-emission energy sources In the International Energy Agency s proposal for achieving net zero emissions by about of the reduction in emissions depends on technologies that are still in development as of Wind and solar market share grew to of worldwide electricity in and costs continue to fall The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change IPCC estimates that of world gross domestic product GDP would need to be invested in the energy system each year between and to limit global warming to C F Governments can fund the research development and demonstration of new clean energy technologies They can also build infrastructure for electrification and sustainable transport Finally governments can encourage clean energy deployment with policies such as carbon pricing renewable portfolio standards and phase-outs of fossil fuel subsidies These policies may also increase energy security Definitions and background edit Energy is the golden thread that connects economic growth increased social equity and an environment that allows the world to thrive Development is not possible without energy and sustainable development is not possible without sustainable energy UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon Definitions edit The United Nations Brundtland Commission described the concept of sustainable development for which energy is a key component in its report Our Common Future It defined sustainable development as meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs This description of sustainable development has since been referenced in many definitions and explanations of sustainable energy There is no universally accepted interpretation of how the concept of sustainability applies to energy on a global scale Working definitions of sustainable energy encompass multiple dimensions of sustainability such as environmental economic and social dimensions Historically the concept of sustainable energy development has focused on emissions and on energy security Since the early s the concept has broadened to encompass wider social and economic issues The environmental dimension of sustainability includes greenhouse gas emissions impacts on biodiversity and ecosystems hazardous waste and toxic emissions water consumption and depletion of non-renewable resources Energy sources with low environmental impact are sometimes called green energy or clean energy The economic dimension of sustainability covers economic development efficient use of energy and energy security to ensure that each country has constant access to sufficient energy Social issues include access to affordable and reliable energy for all people workers rights and land rights Environmental impacts edit Deaths caused as a result of fossil fuel use areas of rectangles in chart greatly exceed those resulting from production of sustainable energy rectangles barely visible in chart A woman in rural Rajasthan India collects firewood The use of wood and other polluting fuels for cooking causes millions of deaths each year from indoor and outdoor air pollution The current energy system contributes to many environmental problems including climate change air pollution biodiversity loss the release of toxins into the environment and water scarcity As of of the world s energy needs are met by burning fossil fuels Energy production and consumption are responsible for of annual human-caused greenhouse gas emissions as of The international Paris Agreement on climate change aims to limit global warming to well below C F and preferably to C F achieving this goal will require that emissions be reduced as soon as possible and reach net-zero by mid-century The burning of fossil fuels and biomass is a major source of air pollution which causes an estimated million deaths each year with the greatest attributable disease burden seen in low and middle-income countries Fossil-fuel burning in power plants vehicles and factories is the main source of emissions that combine with oxygen in the atmosphere to cause acid rain Air pollution is the second-leading cause of death from non-infectious disease An estimated of the world s population lives with levels of air pollution that exceed the World Health Organization recommended limits Cooking with polluting fuels such as wood animal dung coal or kerosene is responsible for nearly all indoor air pollution which causes an estimated to million deaths annually and also contributes significantly to outdoor air pollution Health effects are concentrated among women who are likely to be responsible for cooking and young children Environmental impacts extend beyond the by-products of combustion Oil spills at sea harm marine life and may cause fires which release toxic emissions Around of global water use goes to energy production mainly for cooling in thermal energy plants In dry regions this contributes to water scarcity Bioenergy production coal mining and processing and oil extraction also require large amounts of water Excessive harvesting of wood and other combustible material for burning can cause serious local environmental damage including desertification Sustainable development goals edit Further information Energy poverty and Energy poverty and cooking World map showing where people without access to electricity lived in mainly in sub-Saharan Africa and the Indian subcontinent Meeting existing and future energy demands in a sustainable way is a critical challenge for the global goal of limiting climate change while maintaining economic growth and enabling living standards to rise Reliable and affordable energy particularly electricity is essential for health care education and economic development Energy poverty is a multidimensional problem affecting people s ability to meet basic energy needs Some needs being for lighting heating and cooking As of million people in developing countries do not have access to electricity and around billion rely on burning polluting fuels for cooking Improving energy access in the least-developed countries and making energy cleaner are key to achieving most of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals which cover issues ranging from climate action to gender equality Sustainable Development Goal calls for access to affordable reliable sustainable and modern energy for all including universal access to electricity and to clean cooking facilities by Energy

cornerstone of many sustainable energy strategies The International Energy Agency IEA has estimated that increasing energy efficiency could achieve of greenhouse gas emission reductions needed to fulfil the Paris Agreement s goals Energy can be conserved by increasing the technical efficiency of appliances vehicles industrial processes and buildings Another approach is to use fewer materials whose production requires a lot of energy for example through better building design and recycling Behavioural changes such as using videoconferencing rather than business flights or making urban trips by cycling walking or public transport rather than by car are another way to conserve energy Government policies to improve efficiency can include building codes performance standards carbon pricing and the development of energy-efficient infrastructure to encourage changes in transport modes The energy intensity of the global economy the amount of energy consumed per unit of gross domestic product GDP is a rough indicator of the energy efficiency of economic production In global energy intensity was megajoules kWh per US dollar of GDP United Nations goals call for energy intensity to decrease by each year between and In recent years this target has not been met For instance between and energy intensity decreased by only Efficiency improvements often lead to a rebound effect in which consumers use the money they save to buy more energy-intensive goods and services For example recent technical efficiency improvements in transport and buildings have been largely offset by trends in consumer behaviour such as selecting larger vehicles and homes Sustainable energy sources edit Renewable energy sources edit Main article Renewable energy In electricity generation from wind and solar sources was projected to exceed by Renewable energy capacity has steadily grown led by solar photovoltaic power Clean energy investment has benefited from post-pandemic economic recovery a global energy crisis involving high fossil fuel prices and growing policy support across various nations By investment in the energy transition had grown to about twice that for fossil fuels oil natural gas and coal Renewable energy sources are essential to sustainable energy as they generally strengthen energy security and emit far fewer greenhouse gases than fossil fuels Renewable energy projects sometimes raise significant sustainability concerns such as risks to biodiversity when areas of high ecological value are converted to bioenergy production or wind or solar farms Hydropower is the largest source of renewable electricity while solar and wind energy are growing rapidly Photovoltaic solar and onshore wind are the cheapest forms of new power generation capacity in most countries For more than half of the million people who currently lack access to electricity decentralised renewable energy such as solar-powered mini-grids is likely the cheapest method of providing it by United Nations targets for include substantially increasing the proportion of renewable energy in the world s energy supply According to the International Energy Agency IEA renewable energy sources like wind and solar power are now a commonplace source of electricity making up of all new investments made in the world s power generation The IEA s World Energy Investment said that spending on low-emissions power generation almost doubled over the preceding five years led by solar photovoltaics and that capital investment in the energy sector would rise to trillion in despite geopolitical tensions and economic uncertainty Solar edit A photovoltaic power station in California United States Main articles Solar power and Solar water heating The Sun is Earth s primary source of energy a clean and abundantly available resource in many regions In solar power provided around of global electricity mostly through solar panels based on photovoltaic cells PV Solar PV is expected to be the electricity source with the largest installed capacity worldwide by The panels are mounted on top of buildings or installed in utility-scale solar parks Costs of solar photovoltaic cells have dropped rapidly driving strong growth in worldwide capacity The cost of electricity from new solar farms is competitive with or in many places cheaper than electricity from existing coal plants Various projections of future energy use identify solar PV as one of the main sources of energy generation in a sustainable mix Most components of solar panels can be easily recycled but this is not always done in the absence of regulation Panels typically contain heavy metals so they pose environmental risks if put in landfills It takes fewer than two years for a solar panel to produce as much energy as was used for its production Less energy is needed if materials are recycled rather than mined In concentrated solar power solar rays are concentrated by a field of mirrors heating a fluid Electricity is produced from the resulting steam with a heat engine Concentrated solar power can support dispatchable power generation as some of the heat is typically stored to enable electricity to be generated when needed In addition to electricity production solar energy is used more directly solar thermal heating systems are used for hot water production heating buildings drying and desalination Wind power edit Main articles Wind power and Environmental impact of wind power Wind turbines in Xinjiang China Wind has been an important driver of development over millennia providing mechanical energy for industrial processes water pumps and sailing ships Modern wind turbines are used to generate electricity and provided approximately of global electricity in Electricity from onshore wind farms is often cheaper than existing coal plants and competitive with natural gas and nuclear Wind turbines can also be placed offshore where winds are steadier and stronger than on land but construction and maintenance costs are higher Onshore wind farms often built in wild or rural areas have a visual impact on the landscape Hundreds of wind turbines are often grouped together create wind farms Placing them in one location will lower cost of grid connect and location development While collisions with wind turbines kill both bats and to a lesser extent birds these impacts are lower than from other infrastructure such as windows and transmission lines The noise and flickering light created by the turbines can cause annoyance and constrain construction near densely populated areas Wind power in contrast to nuclear and fossil fuel plants does not consume water Little energy is needed for wind turbine construction compared to the energy produced by the wind power plant itself Turbine blades are not fully recyclable and research into methods of manufacturing easier-to-recycle blades is ongoing Hydropower edit Main article Hydroelectricity Guri Dam a hydroelectric dam in Venezuela Hydroelectric plants convert the energy of moving water into electricity In hydropower supplied of the world s electricity down from a high of nearly in the mid-to-late th century In conventional hydropower a reservoir is created behind a dam Conventional hydropower plants provide a highly flexible dispatchable electricity supply They can be combined with wind and solar power to meet peaks in demand and to compensate when wind and sun are less available Compared to reservoir-based facilities run-of-the-river hydroelectricity generally has less environmental impact However its ability to generate power depends on river flow which can vary with daily and seasonal weather Reservoirs provide water quantity controls that are used for flood control and flexible electricity output while also providing security during drought for drinking water supply and irrigation Hydropower ranks among the energy sources with the lowest levels of greenhouse gas emissions per unit of energy produced but levels of emissions vary enormously between projects The highest emissions tend to occur with large dams in tropical regions These emissions are produced when the biological matter that becomes submerged in the reservoir s flooding decomposes and releases carbon dioxide and methane Deforestation and climate change can reduce energy generation from hydroelectric dams Depending on location large dams can displace residents and cause significant local environmental damage potential dam failure could place the surrounding population at risk Geothermal edit Main articles Geothermal power and Geothermal heating Cooling towers at a geothermal power plant in Larderello Italy Geothermal energy is produced by tapping into deep underground heat and harnessing it to generate electricity or to heat water and buildings The use of geothermal energy is concentrated in regions where heat extraction is economical a combination is needed of high temperatures heat flow and permeability the ability of the rock to allow fluids to pass through Power is produced from the steam created in underground reservoirs Geothermal energy provided less than of global energy consumption in Geothermal energy is a renewable resource because thermal energy is constantly replenished from neighbouring hotter regions and the radioactive decay of naturally occurring isotopes On average the greenhouse gas emissions of geothermal-based electricity are less than that of coal-based electricity Geothermal energy carries a risk of inducing earthquakes needs effective protection to avoid water pollution and releases toxic emissions which can be captured Bioenergy edit Main article Bioenergy Further information Sustainable biofuel Kenyan dairy farmer lighting a biogas lamp Biogas produced from biomass is a renewable energy source that can be burned for cooking or light A sugarcane plantation to produce ethanol in Brazil Biomass is renewable organic material that comes from plants and animals It can either be burned to produce heat and electricity or be converted into biofuels such as biodiesel and ethanol which can be used to power vehicles The climate impact of bioenergy varies considerably depending on where biomass feedstocks come from and how they are grown For example burning wood for energy releases carbon dioxide those emissions can be significantly offset if the trees that were harvested are replaced by new trees in a well-managed forest as the new trees will absorb carbon dioxide from the air as they grow However the establishment and cultivation of bioenergy crops can displace natural ecosystems degrade soils and consume water resources and synthetic fertilisers Approximately one-third of all wood used for traditional heating and cooking in tropical areas is harvested unsustainably Bioenergy feedstocks typically require significant amounts of energy to harvest dry and transport the energy usage for these processes may emit greenhouse gases In some cases the impacts of land-use change cultivation and processing can result in higher overall carbon emissions for bioenergy compared to using fossil fuels Use of farmland for growing biomass can result in less land being available for growing food In the United States around of motor gasoline has been replaced by corn-based ethanol which requires a significant proportion of the harvest In Malaysia and Indonesia clearing forests to produce palm oil for biodiesel has led to serious social and environmental effects as these forests are critical carbon sinks and habitats for diverse species Since photosynthesis captures only a small fraction of the energy in sunlight producing a given amount of bioenergy requires a large amount of land compared to other renewable energy sources Second-generation biofuels which are produced from non-food plants or waste reduce competition with food production but may have other negative effects including trade-offs with conservation areas and local air pollution Relatively sustainable sources of biomass include algae waste and crops grown on soil unsuitable for food production Carbon capture and storage technology can be used to capture emissions from bioenergy power plants This process is known as bioenergy with carbon capture and storage BECCS and can result in net carbon dioxide removal from the atmosphere However BECCS can also result in net positive emissions depending on how the biomass material is grown harvested and transported Deployment of BECCS at scales described in some climate change mitigation pathways would require converting large amounts of cropland Marine energy edit Main article Marine energy Marine energy has the smallest share of the energy market It includes OTEC tidal power which is approaching maturity and wave power which is earlier in its development Two tidal barrage systems in France and in South Korea make up of global production While single marine energy devices pose little risk to the environment the impacts of larger devices are less well known Non-renewable energy sources edit Fossil fuel switching and mitigation edit Switching from coal to natural gas has advantages in terms of sustainability For a given unit of energy produced the life-cycle greenhouse-gas emissions of natural gas are around times the emissions of wind or nuclear energy but are much less than coal Burning natural gas produces around half the emissions of coal when used to generate electricity and around two-thirds the emissions of coal when used to produce heat Natural gas combustion also produces less air pollution than coal However natural gas is a potent greenhouse gas in itself and leaks during extraction and transportation can negate the advantages of switching away from coal The technology to curb methane leaks is widely available but it is not always used Switching from coal to natural gas reduces emissions in the short term and thus contributes to climate change mitigation However in the long term it does not provide a path to net-zero emissions Developing natural gas infrastructure risks carbon lock-in and stranded assets where new fossil infrastructure either commits to decades of carbon emissions or has to be written off before it makes a profit The greenhouse gas emissions of fossil fuel and biomass power plants can be significantly reduced through carbon capture and storage CCS Most studies use a working assumption that CCS can capture of the carbon dioxide CO emissions from a power plant Even if of emitted CO is captured from a coal-fired power plant its uncaptured emissions are still many times greater than the emissions of nuclear solar or wind energy per unit of electricity produced Since coal plants using CCS are less efficient they require more coal and thus increase the pollution associated with mining and transporting coal CCS is one of the most expensive ways of reducing emissions in the energy sector Deployment of this technology is very limited As of CCS is used in only power plants and in other facilities Nuclear power edit Main articles Nuclear power debate and Nuclear renaissance Since the proportion of electricity generated from low-carbon sources has increased only slightly Advances in deploying renewables have been mostly offset by declining shares of nuclear power Nuclear power has been used since the s as a low-carbon source of baseload electricity Nuclear power plants in over countries generate about of global electricity As of nuclear generated over a quarter of all low-carbon energy making it the second largest source after hydropower Nuclear power s lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions including the mining and processing of uranium are similar to the emissions from renewable energy sources Nuclear power uses little land per unit of energy produced compared to the major renewables Additionally Nuclear power does not create local air pollution Although the uranium ore used to fuel nuclear fission plants is a non-renewable resource enough exists to provide a supply for hundreds to thousands of years However uranium resources that can be accessed in an economically feasible manner at the present state are limited and uranium production could hardly keep up during the expansion phase Climate change mitigation pathways consistent with ambitious goals typically see an increase in power supply from nuclear There is controversy over whether nuclear power is sustainable in part due to concerns around nuclear waste nuclear weapon proliferation and accidents Radioactive nuclear waste must be managed for thousands of years For each unit of energy produced nuclear energy has caused far fewer accidental and pollution-related deaths than fossil fuels and the historic fatality rate of nuclear is comparable to renewable sources Public opposition to nuclear energy often makes nuclear plants politically difficult to implement Reducing the time and the cost of building new nuclear plants have been goals for decades but costs remain high and timescales long Various new forms of nuclear energy are in development hoping to address the drawbacks of conventional plants Fast breeder reactors are capable of recycling nuclear waste and therefore can significantly reduce the amount of waste that requires geological disposal but have not yet been deployed on a large-scale commercial basis Nuclear power based on thorium rather than uranium may be able to provide higher energy security for countries that do not have a large supply of uranium Small modular reactors may have several advantages over current large reactors It should be possible to build them faster and their modularization would allow for cost reductions via learning-by-doing They are also considered safer to use than traditional power plants Several countries are attempting to develop nuclear fusion reactors which would generate small amounts of waste and no risk of explosions Although fusion power has taken steps forward in the lab the multi-decade timescale needed to bring it to commercialization and then scale means it will not contribute to a net zero goal for climate change mitigation Energy system transformation edit Main article Energy transition By investment in the energy transition had grown to about twice that for fossil fuels oil natural gas and coal Decarbonisation of the global energy system edit The emissions reductions necessary to keep global warming below C will require a system-wide transformation of the way energy is produced distributed stored and consumed For a society to replace one form of energy with another multiple technologies and behaviours in the energy system must change For example transitioning from oil to solar power as the energy source for cars requires the generation of solar electricity modifications to the electrical grid to accommodate fluctuations in solar panel output or the introduction of variable battery chargers and higher overall demand adoption of electric cars and networks of electric vehicle charging facilities and repair shops Many climate change mitigation pathways envision three main aspects of a low-carbon energy system The use of low-emission energy sources to produce electricity Electrification that is increased use of electricity instead of directly burning fossil fuels Accelerated adoption of energy efficiency measures Some energy-intensive technologies and processes are difficult to electrify including aviation shipping and steelmaking There are several options for reducing the emissions from these sectors biofuels and synthetic carbon-neutral fuels can power many vehicles that are designed to burn fossil fuels however biofuels cannot be sustainably produced in the quantities needed and synthetic fuels are currently very expensive For some applications the most prominent alternative to electrification is to develop a system based on sustainably-produced hydrogen fuel Full decarbonisation of the global energy system is expected to take several decades and can mostly be achieved with existing technologies In the IEA s proposal for achieving net zero emissions by about of the reduction in emissions depends on technologies that are still in development as of Technologies that are relatively immature include batteries and processes to create carbon-neutral fuels Developing new technologies requires research and development demonstration and cost reductions via deployment The transition to a zero-carbon energy system will bring strong co-benefits for human health The World Health Organization estimates that efforts to limit global warming to C could save millions of lives each year from reductions to air pollution alone With good planning and management pathways exist to provide universal access to electricity and clean cooking by in ways that are consistent with climate goals Historically several countries have made rapid economic gains through coal usage However there remains a window of opportunity for many poor countries and regions to leapfrog fossil fuel dependency by developing their energy systems based on renewables given adequate international investment and knowledge transfer Integrating variable energy sources edit See also Grid balancing Buildings in the Solar Settlement at Schlierberg Germany produce more energy than they consume They incorporate rooftop solar panels and are built for maximum energy efficiency To deliver reliable electricity from variable renewable energy sources such as wind and solar electrical power systems require flexibility Most electrical grids were constructed for non-intermittent energy sources such as coal-fired power plants As larger amounts of solar and wind energy are integrated into the grid changes have to be made to the energy system to ensure that the supply of electricity is matched to demand In these sources generated of worldwide electricity a share that has grown rapidly There are various ways to make the electricity system more flexible In many places wind and solar generation are complementary on a daily and a seasonal scale there is more wind during the night and in winter when solar energy production is low Linking different geographical regions through long-distance transmission lines allows for further cancelling out of variability Energy demand can be shifted in time through energy demand management and the use of smart grids matching the times when variable energy production is highest With grid energy storage energy produced in excess can be released when needed Further flexibility could be provided from sector coupling that is coupling the electricity sector to the heat and mobility sector via power-to-heat -systems and electric vehicles Building overcapacity for wind and solar generation can help ensure that enough electricity is produced even during poor weather In optimal weather energy generation may have to be curtailed if excess electricity cannot be used or stored The final demand-supply mismatch may be covered by using dispatchable energy sources such as hydropower bioenergy or natural gas Energy storage edit Main articles Energy storage and Grid energy storage Energy from renewable sources is converted to potential energy that is stored in devices such as electric batteries The stored potential energy is later converted to electricity and added to the power grid even when the original source is unavailable A battery storage facility Energy storage helps overcome barriers to intermittent renewable energy and is an important aspect of a sustainable energy system The most commonly used and available storage method is pumped-storage hydroelectricity which requires locations with large differences in height and access to water Batteries especially lithium-ion batteries are also deployed widely Batteries typically store electricity for short periods research is ongoing into technology with sufficient capacity to last through seasons Costs of utility-scale batteries in the US have fallen by around since however the cost and low energy density of batteries makes them impractical for the very large energy storage needed to balance inter-seasonal variations in energy production Pumped hydro storage and power-to-gas converting electricity to gas and back with capacity for multi-month usage has been implemented in some locations According to the International Energy Agency IEA global battery storage capacity is expected to increase nearly -fold between and driven by falling costs and increased investment in clean infrastructure Electrification edit Main article Electrification The outdoor section of a heat pump In contrast to oil and gas boilers they use electricity and are highly efficient As such electrification of heating can significantly reduce emissions Compared to the rest of the energy system emissions can be reduced much faster in the electricity sector As of of global electricity is produced from low-carbon sources renewables and nuclear energy Fossil fuels primarily coal produce the rest of the electricity supply One of the easiest and fastest ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is to phase out coal-fired power plants and increase renewable electricity generation Climate change mitigation pathways envision extensive electrification the use of electricity as a substitute for the direct burning of fossil fuels for heating buildings and for transport Ambitious climate policy would see a doubling of energy share consumed as electricity by from in One of the challenges in providing universal access to electricity is distributing power to rural areas Off-grid and mini-grid systems based on renewable energy such as small solar PV installations that generate and store enough electricity for a village are important solutions Wider access to reliable electricity would lead to less use of kerosene lighting and diesel generators which are currently common in the developing world Infrastructure for generating and storing renewable electricity requires minerals and metals such as cobalt and lithium for batteries and copper for solar panels Recycling can meet some of this demand if product lifecycles are well-designed however achieving net zero emissions would still require major increases in mining for types of metals and minerals A small group of countries or companies sometimes dominate the markets for these commodities raising geopolitical concerns Most of the world s cobalt for instance is mined in the Democratic Republic of the Congo a politically unstable region where mining is often associated with human rights risks More diverse geographical sourcing may ensure a more flexible and less brittle supply chain Hydrogen edit Main article Hydrogen economy Hydrogen gas is widely discussed as a fuel with potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions This requires hydrogen to be produced cleanly in quantities to supply in sectors and applications where cheaper and more energy efficient mitigation alternatives are limited These applications include heavy industry and long-distance transport Hydrogen can be deployed as an energy source in fuel cells to produce electricity or via combustion to generate heat When hydrogen is consumed in fuel cells the only emission at the point of use is water vapour Combustion of hydrogen can lead to the thermal formation of harmful nitrogen oxides The overall lifecycle emissions of hydrogen depend on how it is produced Nearly all of the world s current supply of hydrogen is created from fossil fuels The main method of producing hydrogen is steam methane reforming in which hydrogen is produced from a chemical reaction between steam and methane the main component of natural gas Producing one tonne of hydrogen through this process emits tonnes of carbon dioxide While carbon capture and storage CCS could remove a large fraction of these emissions the overall carbon footprint of hydrogen from natural gas is difficult to assess as of update in part because of emissions including vented and fugitive methane created in the production of the natural gas itself Electricity can be used to split water molecules producing sustainable hydrogen provided the electricity was generated sustainably However this electrolysis process is currently more expensive than creating hydrogen from methane without CCS and the efficiency of energy conversion is inherently low Hydrogen can be produced when there is a surplus of variable renewable electricity then stored and used to generate heat or to re-generate electricity It can be further transformed into liquid fuels such as green ammonia and green methanol Innovation in hydrogen electrolysers could make large-scale production of hydrogen from electricity more cost-competitive Hydrogen fuel can produce the intense heat required for industrial production of steel cement glass and chemicals thus contributing to the decarbonisation of industry alongside other technologies such as electric arc furnaces for steelmaking For steelmaking hydrogen can function as a clean fuel and simultaneously as a low-carbon catalyst replacing coal-derived coke Hydrogen used to decarbonise transportation is likely to find its largest applications in shipping aviation and to a lesser extent heavy goods vehicles For light duty vehicles including passenger cars hydrogen is far behind other alternative fuel vehicles especially compared with the rate of adoption of battery electric vehicles and may not play a significant role in future Disadvantages of hydrogen as a fuel include high costs of storage and distribution due to hydrogen s explosivity its large volume compared to other fuels and its tendency to make pipes brittle Energy usage technologies edit Transport edit Utility cycling infrastructure such as this bike lane in Vancouver encourages sustainable transport Main article Sustainable transport Transport accounts for of global greenhouse gas emissions but there are multiple ways to make transport more sustainable Public transport typically emits fewer greenhouse gases per passenger than personal vehicles since trains and buses can carry many more passengers at once Short-distance flights can be replaced by high-speed rail which is more efficient especially when electrified Promoting non-motorised transport such as walking and cycling particularly in cities can make transport cleaner and healthier The energy efficiency of cars has increased over time but shifting to electric vehicles is an important further step towards decarbonising transport and reducing air pollution A large proportion of traffic-related air pollution consists of particulate matter from road dust and the wearing-down of tyres and brake pads Substantially reducing pollution from these non-tailpipe sources cannot be achieved by electrification it requires measures such as making vehicles lighter and driving them less Light-duty cars in particular are a prime candidate for decarbonization using battery technology of the world s CO emissions still originate from the transportation sector Long-distance freight transport and aviation are difficult sectors to electrify with current technologies mostly because of the weight of batteries needed for long-distance travel battery recharging times and limited battery lifespans Where available freight transport by ship and rail is generally more sustainable than by air and by road Hydrogen vehicles may be an option for larger vehicles such as lorries Many of the techniques needed to lower emissions from shipping and aviation are still early in their development with ammonia produced from hydrogen a promising candidate for shipping fuel Aviation biofuel may be one of the better uses of bioenergy if emissions are captured and stored during manufacture of the fuel Buildings edit Further information Renewable heat Green building and Zero-energy building Over one-third of energy use is in buildings and their construction To heat buildings alternatives to burning fossil fuels and biomass include electrification through heat pumps or electric heaters geothermal energy central solar heating reuse of waste heat and seasonal thermal energy storage Heat pumps provide both heat and air conditioning through a single appliance The IEA estimates heat pumps could provide over of space and water heating requirements globally A highly efficient way to heat buildings is through district heating in which heat is generated in a centralized location and then distributed to multiple buildings through insulated pipes Traditionally most district heating systems have used fossil fuels but modern and cold district heating systems are designed to use high shares of renewable energy Passive cooling features such as these windcatcher towers in Iran bring cool air into buildings without any use of energy Cooling of buildings can be made more efficient through passive building design planning that minimizes the urban heat island effect and district cooling systems that cool multiple buildings with piped cold water Air conditioning requires large amounts of electricity and is not always affordable for poorer households Some air conditioning units still use refrigerants that are greenhouse gases as some countries have not ratified the Kigali Amendment to only use climate-friendly refrigerants Cooking edit Further information Energy poverty and cooking For cooking electric induction stoves are one of the most energy-efficient and safest options In developing countries where populations suffer from energy poverty polluting fuels such as wood or animal dung are often used for cooking Cooking with these fuels is generally unsustainable because they release harmful smoke and because harvesting wood can lead to forest degradation The universal adoption of clean cooking facilities which are already ubiquitous in rich countries would dramatically improve health and have minimal negative effects on climate Clean cooking facilities e g cooking facilities that produce less indoor soot typically use natural gas liquefied petroleum gas both of which consume oxygen and produce carbon-dioxide or electricity as the energy source biogas systems are a promising alternative in some contexts Improved cookstoves that burn biomass more efficiently than traditional stoves are an interim solution where transitioning to clean cooking systems is difficult Industry edit Over one-third of energy use is by industry Most of that energy is deployed in thermal processes generating heat drying and refrigeration The share of renewable energy in industry was in mostly low-temperature heat supplied by bioenergy and electricity The most energy-intensive activities in industry have the lowest shares of renewable energy as they face limitations in generating heat at temperatures over C F For some industrial processes commercialisation of technologies that have not yet been built or operated at full scale will be needed to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions Steelmaking for instance is difficult to electrify because it traditionally uses coke which is derived from coal both to create very high-temperature heat and as an ingredient in the steel itself The production of plastic cement and fertilisers also requires significant amounts of energy with limited possibilities available to decarbonise A switch to a circular economy would make industry more sustainable as it involves recycling more and thereby using less energy compared to investing energy to mine and refine new raw materials Government policies edit Further information Politics of climate change and Energy policy Bringing new energy technologies to market can often take several decades but the imperative of reaching net zero emissions globally by means that progress has to be much faster Experience has shown that the role of government is crucial in shortening the time needed to bring new technology to market and to diffuse it widely International Energy Agency Well-designed government policies that promote energy system transformation can lower greenhouse gas emissions and improve air quality simultaneously and in many cases can also increase energy security and lessen the financial burden of using energy Regulations edit Environmental regulations have been used since the s to promote more sustainable use of energy Some governments have committed to dates for phasing out coal-fired power plants and ending new fossil fuel exploration Governments can require that new cars produce zero emissions or new buildings are heated by electricity instead of gas Renewable portfolio standards in several countries require utilities to increase the percentage of electricity they generate from renewable sources Governments can accelerate energy system transformation by leading the development of infrastructure such as long-distance electrical transmission lines smart grids and hydrogen pipelines In transport appropriate infrastructure and incentives can make travel more efficient and less car-dependent Urban planning that discourages sprawl can reduce energy use in local transport and buildings while enhancing quality of life Government-funded research procurement and incentive policies have historically been critical to the development and maturation of clean energy technologies such as solar and lithium batteries In the IEA s scenario for a net zero-emission energy system by public funding is rapidly mobilised to bring a range of newer technologies to the demonstration phase and to encourage deployment Several countries and the European Union have committed to dates for all new cars to be zero-emissions vehicles Carbon pricing edit Carbon pricing such as a tax on CO emissions gives industries and consumers an incentive to reduce emissions while letting them choose how to do so For example they can shift to low-emission energy sources improve energy efficiency or reduce their use of energy-intensive products and services Carbon pricing has encountered strong political pushback in some jurisdictions whereas energy-specific policies tend to be politically safer Most studies indicate that to limit global warming to C carbon pricing would need to be complemented by stringent energy-specific policies As of the price of carbon in most regions is too low to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement Carbon taxes provide a source of revenue that can be used to lower other taxes or help lower-income households afford higher energy costs Some governments such as the EU and the UK are exploring the use of carbon border adjustments These place tariffs on imports from countries with less stringent climate policies to ensure that industries subject to internal carbon prices remain competitive Pace edit The scale and pace of policy reforms that have been initiated as of are far less than needed to fulfil the climate goals of the Paris Agreement In addition to domestic policies greater international cooperation is required to accelerate innovation and to assist poorer countries in establishing a sustainable path to full energy access Countries may support renewables to create jobs The International Labour Organization estimates that efforts to limit global warming to C would result in net job creation in most sectors of the economy It predicts that million new jobs would be created by in areas such as renewable electricity generation improving energy-efficiency in buildings and the transition to electric vehicles Six million jobs would be lost in sectors such as mining and fossil fuels Governments can make the transition to sustainable energy more politically and socially feasible by ensuring a just transition for workers and regions that depend on the fossil fuel industry to ensure they have alternative economic opportunities Finance edit Further information Climate finance Electrified transport and renewable energy are key areas of investment for the renewable energy transition China s count of multi-country patent filings has surged since the mid- s leading in batteries and solar though Europe still dominates in wind energy and smart grids China also leads in highly cited publications in global peer-reviewed journals Raising enough money for innovation and investment is a prerequisite for the energy transition The IPCC estimates that to limit global warming to C US trillion would need to be invested in the energy system each year between and Most studies project that these costs equivalent to of world GDP would be small compared to the economic and health benefits Average annual investment in low-carbon energy technologies and energy efficiency would need to be six times more by compared to Underfunding is particularly acute in the least developed countries which are not attractive to the private sector The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change estimates that climate financing totalled billion in Most of this is private-sector investment in renewable energy deployment public-sector investment in sustainable transport and private-sector investment in energy efficiency The Paris Agreement includes a pledge of an extra billion per year from developed countries to poor countries to do climate change mitigation and adaptation This goal has not been met and measurement of progress has been hampered by unclear accounting rules If energy-intensive businesses like chemicals fertilizers ceramics steel and non-ferrous metals invest significantly in R D its usage in industry might amount to between and of all energy used Fossil fuel funding and subsidies are a significant barrier to the energy transition Direct global fossil fuel subsidies were billion in This rises to trillion when indirect costs are priced in like the effects of air pollution Ending these could lead to a reduction in global carbon emissions and a reduction in air pollution deaths Funding for clean energy has been largely unaffected by the COVID- pandemic and pandemic-related economic stimulus packages offer possibilities for a green recovery References edit a b c Kutscher Milford Kreith pp

Watercraft Personal transporter Rail transport Tram Rapid transit Personal rapid transit Category Renewable energy portal v t e Energy conservation is the effort to reduce wasteful energy consumption by using fewer energy services This can be done by using energy more effectively using less and better sources of energy for continuous service or changing one s behavior to use less and better source of service for example by driving vehicles which consume renewable energy or energy with more efficiency Energy conservation can be achieved through efficient energy use which has some advantages including a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and a smaller carbon footprint as well as cost water and energy savings Green engineering practices improve the life cycle of the components of machines which convert energy from one form into another Energy can be conserved by reducing waste and losses improving efficiency through technological upgrades improving operations and maintenance changing users behaviors through user profiling or user activities monitoring appliances shifting load to off-peak hours and providing energy-saving recommendations Observing appliance usage establishing an energy usage profile and revealing energy consumption patterns in circumstances where energy is used poorly can pinpoint user habits and behaviors in energy consumption Appliance energy profiling helps identify inefficient appliances with high energy consumption and energy load Seasonal variations also greatly influence energy load as more air-conditioning is used in warmer seasons and heating in colder seasons Achieving a balance between energy load and user comfort is complex yet essential for energy preservation On a large scale a few factors affect energy consumption trends including political issues technological developments economic growth and environmental concerns User-oriented energy conservation edit User behavior has a significant effect on energy conservation It involves user activity detection profiling and appliance interaction behaviors User profiling consists of the identification of energy usage patterns of the user and replacing required system settings with automated settings that can be initiated on request Within user profiling personal characteristics are instrumental in affecting energy conservation behavior These characteristics include household income education gender age and social norms User behavior also relies on the impact of personality traits social norms and attitudes on energy conservation behavior Beliefs and attitudes toward a convenient lifestyle environmentally friendly transport energy security and residential location choices affect energy conservation behavior As a result energy conservation can be made possible by adopting pro-environmental behavior and energy-efficient systems Education on approaches to energy conservation can result in wise energy use The choices made by the users yield energy usage patterns Rigorous analysis of these usage patterns identifies waste energy patterns and improving those patterns may reduce significant energy load Therefore human behavior is critical to determining the implications of energy conservation measures and solving environmental problems Substantial energy conservation may be achieved if users habit loops are modified User habits edit User habits significantly impact energy demand thus providing recommendations for improving user habits contributes to energy conservation Micro-moments are essential in realizing energy consumption patterns and are identified using a variety of sensing units positioned in prominent areas across the home The micro-moment is an event that changes the state of the appliance from inactive to active and helps in building users energy consumption profiles according to their activities Energy conservation can be achieved through user habits by following energy-saving recommendations at micro-moments Unnecessary energy usage can be decreased by selecting a suitable schedule for appliance operation Creating an effective scheduling system requires an understanding of user habits regarding appliances Off-peak scheduling edit Many techniques for energy conservation comprise off-peak scheduling which means operating an appliance in a low-price energy hour This schedule can be achieved after user habits regarding appliance use are understood Most energy providers divide the energy tariff into high and low-price hours therefore scheduling an appliance to work an off-peak hour will significantly reduce electricity bills User activity detection edit User activity detection leads to the precise detection of appliances required for an activity If an appliance is active but not required for a user s current activity it wastes energy and can be turned off to conserve energy The precise identification of user activities is necessary to achieve this method of energy conservation Energy conservation opportunities by sector edit Buildings edit Existing buildings edit Energy conservation measures have primarily focused on technological innovations to improve efficiencies and financial incentives with theoretical explanations obtained from the mentioned analytical traditions Existing buildings can improve energy efficiency by changing structural maintenance materials adjusting the composition of air conditioning systems selecting energy-saving equipment and formulating subsidy policies These measures can improve users thermal comfort and reduce buildings environmental impact The selection of combinatorial optimization schemes that contain measures to guide and restrict users behavior in addition to carrying out demand-side management can dynamically adjust energy consumption At the same time economic means should enable users to change their behavior and achieve a low-carbon life Combination optimization and pricing incentives reduce building energy consumption and carbon emissions and reduce users costs Energy consumption by household type in the northeast United States in Energy monitoring through energy audits can achieve energy efficiency in existing buildings An energy audit is an inspection and analysis of energy use and flows for energy conservation in a structure process or system intending to reduce energy input without negatively affecting output Energy audits can determine specific opportunities for energy conservation and efficiency measures as well as determine cost-effective strategies Training professionals typically accomplish this and can be part of some national programs discussed above The recent development of smartphone apps enables homeowners to complete relatively sophisticated energy audits themselves For instance smart thermostats can connect to standard HVAC systems to maintain energy-efficient indoor temperatures In addition data loggers can also be installed to monitor the interior temperature and humidity levels to provide a more precise understanding of the conditions If the data gathered is compared with the users perceptions of comfort more fine-tuning of the interiors can be implemented e g increasing the temperature where A C is used to prevent over-cooling Building technologies and smart meters can allow commercial and residential energy users to visualize the impact their energy use can have in their workplaces or homes Advanced real-time energy metering can help people save energy through their actions Another approach towards energy conservation is the implementation of ECMs in commercial buildings which often employ Energy Service Companies ESCOs experienced in energy performance contracting This industry has been around since the s and is more prevalent than ever today The US-based organization EVO Efficiency Valuation Organization has created a set of guidelines for ESCOs to adhere to in evaluating the savings achieved by ECMs These guidelines are called the International Performance Measurement and Verification Protocol IPMVP Energy efficiency can also be achieved by upgrading certain aspects of existing buildings Making thermal improvements by adding insulation to crawl spaces and ensuring no leaks achieves an efficient building envelope reducing the need for mechanical systems to heat and cool the space High-performance insulation is also supported by adding double triple-glazed windows to minimize thermal heat transmission Minor upgrades in existing buildings include changing mixers to low flow greatly aids in water conservation changing light bulbs to LED lights results in - less energy consumption than a standard incandescent or C F L bulb changing inefficient appliances with Energy Star-rated appliances will consume less energy and finally adding vegetation in the landscape surrounding the building to function as a shading element A window windcatcher can reduce the total energy use of a building by Paint colors and new paint technologies can conserve energy A windcatcher and qanat used for cooling Windcatchers reduce the building s energy consumption and carbon footprint Energy conservation through users behaviors requires understanding household occupants lifestyle social and behavioral factors in analyzing energy consumption This involves one-time investments in energy efficiency such as purchasing new energy-efficient appliances or upgrading the building insulation without curtailing economic utility or the level of energy services and energy curtailment behaviors which are theorized to be driven more by social-psychological factors and environmental concerns in comparison to the energy efficiency behaviors Replacing existing appliances with newer and more efficient ones leads to energy efficiency as less energy is wasted throughout Overall energy efficiency behaviors are identified more with one-time cost-incurring investments in efficient appliances and retrofits while energy curtailment behaviors include repetitive low-cost energy-saving efforts To identify and optimize residential energy use conventional and behavioral economics technology adoption theory and attitude-based decision-making social and environmental psychology and sociology must be analyzed The techno-economic and psychological literature analysis focuses on the individual attitude behavior and choice context external conditions In contrast the sociological literature relies more on the energy consumption practices shaped by the social cultural and economic factors in a dynamic setting New buildings edit Many steps can be taken toward energy conservation and efficiency when designing new buildings Firstly the building can be designed to optimize building performance by having an efficient building envelope with high-performing insulation and window glazing systems window facades strategically oriented to optimize daylighting shading elements to mitigate unwanted glare and passive energy systems for appliances In passive solar building designs windows walls and floors are made to collect store and distribute solar energy in the form of heat in the winter and reject solar heat in the summer The key to designing a passive solar building is to best take advantage of the local climate Elements to be considered include window placement and glazing type thermal insulation thermal mass and shading Optimizing daylighting can decrease energy waste from incandescent bulbs windows and balconies allow natural ventilation reduce the need for heating and cooling low flow mixers aid in water conservation and upgrade to Energy star rated appliances consume less energy Designing a building according to LEED guidelines while incorporating smart home technology can help save a lot of energy and money in the long run Passive solar design techniques can be applied most easily to new buildings but existing buildings can be retrofitted Mainly energy conservation is achieved by modifying user habits or providing an energy-saving recommendation of curtailing an appliance or scheduling it to low-price energy tariff hours Besides changing user habits and appliance control identifying irrelevant appliances concerning user activities in smart homes saves energy Smart home technology can advise users on energy-saving strategies according to their behavior encouraging behavioral change that leads to energy conservation This guidance includes reminders to turn off lights leakage sensors to prevent plumbing issues running appliances on off-peak hours and smart sensors that save energy Such technology learns user-appliance activity patterns gives a complete overview of various energy-consuming appliances and can provide guidance to improve these patterns to contribute to energy conservation As a result they can strategically schedule appliances by monitoring the energy consumption profiles of the appliances schedule devices to the energy-efficient mode or plan to work during off-peak hours Appliance-oriented approaches emphasize appliance profiling curtailing and scheduling to off-peak hours as supervision of appliances is key to energy preservation It usually leads to appliance curtailment in which an appliance is either scheduled to work another time or is turned off Appliance curtailment involves appliance recognition activity-appliances model unattended appliance detection and energy conservation service The appliance recognition module detects active appliances to identify the activities of smart home users After identifying users activities the association between the functional appliances and user activities is established The unattended appliance detection module looks for active appliances but is unrelated to user activity These functional appliances waste energy and can be turned off by providing recommendations to the user Based on the smart home recommendations users can give weight to certain appliances that increase user comfort and satisfaction while conserving energy Energy consumption models of energy consumption of appliances and the level of comfort they create can balance priorities among smart home comfort levels and energy consumption According to Kashimoto Ogura Yamamoto Yasumoto and Ito the energy supply reduces based on the historical state of the appliance and increases according to the comfort level requirement of the user leading to a targeted energy-saving ratio Scenarios-based energy consumption can be employed as a strategy for energy conservation with each scenario encompassing a specific set of rules for energy consumption Elements of passive solar design shown in a direct gain application Transportation edit Further information Carfree city Transporting people goods and services represented of U S energy consumption in The transportation sector also accounted for about of U S carbon dioxide emissions in with highway vehicles accounting for about of that making transportation an essential target for addressing global climate change E I A Suburban infrastructure evolved during an age of relatively easy access to fossil fuels leading to transportation-dependent living systems citation needed The amount of energy used to transport people to and from a facility whether they are commuters customers vendors or homeowners is known as the transportation energy intensity of the building Land is developing at a faster rate than population growth leading to urban sprawl and therefore high transportation energy intensity as more people need to commute longer distances to jobs As a result the location of a building is essential in decreasing embodied emissions In transportation state and local efforts in energy conservation and efficiency measures tend to be more targeted and smaller in scale However with more robust fuel economy standards new targets for the use of alternative transportation fuels and new efforts in electric and hybrid electric vehicles EPAct and EISA provide a new set of national policy signals and financial incentives to the private sector and state and local governments for the transportation sector Zoning reforms that allow greater urban density and designs for walking and bicycling can greatly reduce energy consumed for transportation Many Americans work in jobs that allow for remote work instead of commuting daily which is a significant opportunity to conserve energy citation needed Intelligent transportation systems ITS provide a solution to traffic congestion and C E s caused by increased vehicles ITS combines improvements in information technology and systems communications sensors controllers and advanced mathematical methods with the traditional world of transportation infrastructure It improves traffic safety and mobility reduces environmental impact promotes sustainable transportation and increases productivity The ITS strengthens the connection and cooperation between people vehicles roads and the environment while improving road capacity reducing traffic accidents and improving transportation efficiency and safety by alleviating traffic congestion and reducing pollution It makes full use of traffic information as an application service which can enhance the operational efficiency of existing traffic facilities The most significant energy-saving potential is that there are the most problems in urban transportation in various countries such as management systems policies and regulations planning technology operation and management mechanism Improvements in one or several aspects will improve road transportation Efficiency has a positive impact which leads to the improvement of the urban traffic environment and efficiency In addition to ITS transit-oriented development T O D significantly improves transportation in urban areas by emphasizing density proximity to transit diversity of uses and streetscape design Density is important for optimizing location and is a way to cut down on driving Planners can regulate development rights by exchanging them from ecologically sensitive areas to growth-friendly zones according to density transfer procedures Distance is defined as the accessibility of rail and bus transits which serve as deterrents for driving For transit-oriented development to be feasible transportation stops must be close to where people live Diversity refers to mixed-use areas that offer essential services close to homes and offices and include residential spaces for different socioeconomic categories commercial and retail This creates a pedestrian shed where one area can meet people s everyday needs on foot Lastly the streetscapes design involves minimal parking and walkable areas that calm traffic Generous parking incentivizes people to use cars whereas minimal and expensive parking deters commuters At the same time streetscapes can be designed to incorporate bicycling lanes and designated bicycle paths and trails People may commute by bicycle to work without being concerned about their bicycles becoming wet because of covered bicycle storage This encourages commuters to use bicycles rather than other modes of transportation and contributes to energy saving People will be happy to walk a few blocks from a train stop if there are attractive pedestrian-friendly outdoor spaces nearby with good lighting park benches outdoor tables at caf s shade tree plantings pedestrian courts that are blocked off to cars and public internet connection Additionally this strategy calms traffic improving the intended pedestrian environment New urban planning schemes can be designed to improve connectivity in cities through networks of interconnected streets that spread out traffic flow slow down vehicles and make walking more pleasant By dividing the number of road links by the number of road nodes the connectivity index is calculated The higher the connectivity index the greater the route choices and the better the pedestrian access Realizing the transportation impacts associated with buildings allows commuters to take steps toward energy conservation Connectivity encourages energy-conserving behaviors as commuters use fewer cars walk and bike more and use public transportation For commuters who do not have the option of public transportation smaller vehicles that are hybrid or have better mileage can be used Occupancy sensors can conserve energy by turning off appliances in unoccupied rooms Consumer products edit An assortment of energy-efficient semiconductor LED lamps for commercial and residential lighting use LED lamps to use at least less energy and last times longer than traditional incandescent light bulbs Homeowners implementing ECMs in their residential buildings often start with an energy audit This is a way homeowners look at what areas of their homes are using and possibly losing energy Residential energy auditors are accredited by the Building Performance Institute BPI or the Residential Energy Services Network RESNET Homeowners can hire a professional or do it themselves or use a smartphone to help do an audit Energy conservation measures are often combined into larger guaranteed Energy Savings Performance Contracts to maximize energy savings while minimizing disruption to building occupants by coordinating renovations Some ECMs cost less to implement yet return higher energy savings Traditionally lighting projects were a good example of low hanging fruit that could be used to drive implementation of more substantial upgrades to HVAC systems in large facilities Smaller buildings might combine window replacement with modern insulation using advanced building foams to improve energy for performance Energy dashboard projects are a new kind of ECM that relies on the behavioral change of building occupants to save energy When implemented as part of a program case studies such as that for the DC Schools report energy savings up Under the right circumstances open energy dashboards can even be implemented for free to improve upon these savings even more Consumers are often poorly informed of the savings of energy-efficient products citation needed A prominent example of this is the energy savings that can be made by replacing an incandescent light bulb with a more modern alternative When purchasing light bulbs many consumers opt for cheap incandescent bulbs failing to take into account their higher energy costs and lower lifespans when compared to modern compact fluorescent and LED bulbs Although these energy-efficient alternatives have a higher upfront cost their long lifespan and low energy use can save consumers a considerable amount of money The price of LED bulbs has also been steadily decreasing in the past five years due to improvements in semiconductor technology Many LED bulbs on the market qualify for utility rebates that further reduce the price of the purchase to the consumer Estimates by the U S Department of Energy state that widespread adoption of LED lighting over the next years could result in about billion worth of savings in United States energy costs The research one must put into conserving energy is often too time-consuming and costly for the average consumer when there are cheaper products and technology available using today s fossil fuels Some governments and NGOs are attempting to reduce this complexity with Eco-labels that make differences in energy efficiency easy to research while shopping To provide the kind of information and support people need to invest money time and effort in energy conservation it is important to understand and link to people s topical concerns For instance some retailers argue that bright lighting stimulates purchasing However health studies have demonstrated that headache stress blood pressure fatigue and worker error all generally increase with the common over-illumination present in many workplace and retail settings It has been shown that natural daylighting increases productivity levels of workers while reducing energy consumption In warm climates where air conditioning is used any household device that gives off heat will result in a larger load on the cooling system Items such as stoves dishwashers clothes dryers hot water and incandescent lighting all add heat to the home Low-power or insulated versions of these devices give off less heat for the air conditioning to remove The air conditioning system can also improve efficiency by using a heat sink that is cooler than the standard air heat exchanger such as geothermal or water In cold climates heating air and water is a major demand for household energy use Significant energy reductions are possible by using different technologies Heat pumps are a more efficient alternative to electrical resistance heaters for warming air or water A variety of efficient clothes dryers are available and the clothes lines requires no energy- only time Natural-gas or bio-gas condensing boilers and hot-air furnaces increase efficiency over standard hot-flue models Standard electric boilers can be made to run only at hours of the day when they are needed by means of a time switch This decreases energy use vastly In showers a semi-closed-loop system could be used New construction implementing heat exchangers can capture heat from wastewater or exhaust air in bathrooms laundry and kitchens In both warm and cold climate extremes airtight thermal insulated construction is the largest factor determining the efficiency of a home Insulation is added to minimize the flow of heat to or from the home but can be labor-intensive to retrofit to an existing home Energy conservation by countries edit Asia edit Although energy efficiency is expected to play a vital role in cost-effectively cutting energy demand only a small part of its economic potential is exploited in Asia Governments have implemented a range of subsidies such as cash grants cheap credit tax exemptions and co-financing with public-sector funds to encourage energy-efficiency initiatives across several sectors Governments in the Asia-Pacific region have implemented a range of information provision and labeling programs for buildings appliances and the transportation and induel-economy labels or actively seek to encourage behavioral changes such as Japan s Cool Biz campaign that encourages setting air conditioners at -degrees Celsius and allowing employees to dress casually in the summer China s government has launched a series of policies since to effectively promote the goal of reducing energy-saving emissions however road transportation the fastest-growing energy-consuming sector in the transportation industry lacks specific operational and systematic energy-saving plans Road transportation is the highest priority to achieve energy conservation effectively and reduce emissions particularly since social and economic development has entered the new norm period Generally speaking the government should make comprehensive plans for conservation and emissions reduction in the road transportation industry within the three dimensions of demand structure and technology For example encouraging trips using public transportation and new transportation modes such as car-sharing and increasing investment in new energy vehicles in structure reform etc European Union edit At the end of the European Union EU pledged to cut its annual consumption of primary energy by by The EU Energy Efficiency Directive mandates energy efficiency improvements within the EU As part of the EU s SAVE program aimed at promoting energy efficiency and encouraging energy-saving behavior the Boiler Efficiency Directive specifies minimum levels of efficiency for boilers using liquid or gaseous fuels There is steady progress on energy regulation implementation in Europe North America and Asia with the highest number of building energy standards being adopted and implemented Moreover the performance of Europe is highly encouraging concerning energy standard activities They recorded the highest percentage of mandatory energy standards compared to the other five regions In energy savings in Europe can reach of the baseline scenario amounting to a demand of Mtoe in an energy efficiency first societal trend scenario A condition is that there be no rebound effect for otherwise the savings are only or energy use may even increase by if techno-economic potentials are not realized Germany has reduced its primary energy consumption by from to and set itself goals of reducing it by by the year and by by the year in comparison to the

walk of life In the recent past PCRA has organised mass media campaigns in television radio and print media This is an impact-assessment survey by a third party that revealed that due to these larger campaigns by PCRA the public s overall awareness level has gone up leading to the saving of fossil fuels worth crores of rupees besides reducing pollution The Bureau of Energy Efficiency is an Indian government organization created in that is responsible for promoting energy efficiency and conservation Protection and Conservation of Natural Resources are done by Community Natural Resources Management CNRM Iran edit Supreme leader of Iran Ali Khamenei had regularly criticized energy administration and high fuel consumption Japan edit Advertising with high energy and light pollution in Shinjuku Japan Since the oil crisis energy conservation has been an issue in Japan All oil-based fuel is imported so domestic sustainable energy is being developed The Energy Conservation Center promotes energy efficiency in every aspect of Japan Public entities are implementing the efficient use of energy for industries and research It includes projects such as the Top Runner Program In this project new appliances are regularly tested on efficiency and the most efficient ones are made the standard Middle East edit The Middle East holds of the world s crude oil reserves and of its natural gas reserves Conservation of domestic fossil fuels is therefore a legitimate priority for the Gulf countries given domestic needs as well as the global market for these products Energy subsidies are the chief barrier to conservation in the Gulf Residential electricity prices can be a tenth of U S rates As a result increased tariff revenues from gas electricity and water sales would encourage investment in natural gas exploration and production and generation capacity helping to alleviate future shortages Households in the MENA region are responsible for of energy use in Saudi Arabia and of the UAE s ecological footprint This is partially due to poorly designed and constructed buildings mainly under a cheap energy model that has left them without contemporary control technology or even proper insulation and efficient appliances Building energy consumption can be cut by under a combination of insulation efficient windows and appliances shading reflective roofing and a host of automated controls that adjust energy use Governments could also set minimum energy efficiency and water use standards on importing appliances sold inside their countries effectively banning the sale of inefficient air conditioners dishwashers and washing machines Administration of the laws would essentially be a function of national customs services Governments could go further offering incentives or mandates that air conditioners of a certain age be replaced Lebanon edit In Lebanon and since The Lebanese Center for Energy Conservation LCEC has been promoting the development of efficient and rational uses of energy and the use of renewable energy at the consumer level It was created as a project financed by the International Environment Facility GEF and the Ministry of Energy Water MEW under the management of the United Nations Development Programme UNDP and gradually established itself as an independent technical national center although it continues to be supported by the United Nations Development Programme UNDP as indicated in the Memorandum of Understanding MoU signed between MEW and UNDP on June Nepal edit Until recently Nepal has been focusing on the exploitation of its huge water resources to produce hydropower Demand-side management and energy conservation were not in the focus of government action In bilateral Development Cooperation between Nepal and the Federal Republic of Germany has agreed upon the joint implementation of the Nepal Energy Efficiency Programme The lead executing agencies for the implementation are the Water and Energy Commission Secretariat WECS The aim of the program is the promotion of energy efficiency in policymaking in rural and urban households as well as in the industry Due to the lack of a government organization that promotes energy efficiency in the country the Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry FNCCI has established the Energy Efficiency Centre under his roof to promote energy conservation in the private sector The Energy Efficiency Centre is a non-profit initiative that is offering energy auditing services to the industries The centre is also supported by Nepal Energy Efficiency Programme of Deutsche Gesellschaft f r Internationale Zusammenarbeit A study conducted in found out that Nepalese industries could save -megawatt hours of electricity and terajoules of thermal energy like diesel furnace oil and coal every year These savings are equivalent to annual energy cost cut of up to Billion Nepalese Rupees As a result of Nepal Economic Forum an economic reform agenda in the priority sectors was declared focusing on energy conservation among others In the energy reform agenda the government of Nepal gave the commitment to introduce incentive packages in the budget of the fiscal year for industries that practices energy efficiency or use efficient technologies incl cogeneration New Zealand edit In New Zealand the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority is the Government Agency responsible for promoting energy efficiency and conservation The Energy Management Association of New Zealand is a membership-based organization representing the New

Government is encouraging Lagosians to imbibe an energy conservation culture In the Lagos State Electricity Board LSEB ran an initiative tagged Conserve Energy Save Money under the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources The initiative is designed to sensitize Lagosians around the theme of energy conservation by influencing their behavior through do-it-yourself tips In September Governor Babatunde Raji Fashola of Lagos State and the campaign ambassador rapper Jude MI Abaga participated in the Governor s conference video call on the topic of energy conservation In addition to this during the month of October the official energy conservation month in the state LSEB hosted experience centers in malls around Lagos State where members of the public were encouraged to calculate their household energy consumption and discover ways to save money using a consumer-focused energy app To get Lagosians started on energy conservation solar lamps and energy-saving bulbs were also handed out In Kaduna State the Kaduna Power Supply Company KAPSCO ran a program to replace all light bulbs in Public Offices fitting energy-saving bulbs in place of incandescent bulbs KAPSCO is also embarking on an initiative to retrofit all conventional streetlights in the Kaduna Metropolis to LEDs which consume much less energy Sri Lanka edit Sri Lanka currently consumes fossil fuels hydro power wind power solar power and dendro power for their day to day power generation The Sri Lanka Sustainable Energy Authority is playing a major role regarding energy management and energy conservation Today most industries are requested to reduce their energy consumption by using renewable energy sources and optimizing their energy usage Turkey edit Turkey aims to decrease by at least the amount of energy consumed per GDP of Turkey by energy intensity United Kingdom edit The Department for Business Energy and Industrial Strategy is responsible for promoting energy efficiency in the United Kingdom United States edit Main article Energy conservation in the United States The United States is currently the second-largest single consumer of energy following China The U S Department of Energy categorizes national energy use in four broad sectors transportation residential commercial and industrial About half of U S energy consumption in the transportation and residential sectors is primarily controlled by individual consumers In the typical American home space heating is the most significant energy use followed by electrical technology appliances lighting and electronics and water heating Commercial and industrial energy expenditures are determined by businesses entities and other facility managers National energy policy has a significant effect on energy usage across all four sectors Since the oil embargoes and price spikes of the s energy efficiency and conservation have been fundamental tenets of U S energy policy The scope of energy conservation and efficiency measures has been broadened throughout time by U S energy policies and programs including federal and state legislation and regulatory actions to include all economic sectors and all geographical areas of the nation Measurable energy conservation and efficiency gains in the s led to the Energy Security Report to the President DOE that the United States uses about quads less energy in a year today than it would have if our economic growth since had been accompanied by the less- efficient trends in energy use we were following at that time The DOE Strategy and the legislation included new strategies for strengthening conservation and efficiency in buildings industry and electric power such as integrated resource planning for electric and natural gas utilities and efficiency and labeling standards for residential appliances and equipment categories Lack of a national consensus on how to proceed interfered with developing a consistent and comprehensive approach Nevertheless the Energy Policy Act of EPAct th U S Congress contained many new energy conservation and efficiency provisions in the transportation buildings and electric power sectors The most recent federal law to increase and broaden U S energy conservation and efficiency laws programs and practices is the Energy Independence and Security Act of EISA Over the next few decades it is anticipated that EISA will significantly reduce energy use because it has more standards and targets than previous legislation Both acts reinforce the importance of lighting and appliance efficiency programs targeting an additional lighting efficiency by introducing new standards for appliances and setting up new standards for vehicle fuel economy The Federal Government is also promoting a new model code for efficient building practices in the construction industry Additionally according to the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy ACEEE the EISA s energy efficiency and conservation initiatives will cut carbon dioxide emissions by in These requirements cover appliance and lighting efficiency energy savings in homes businesses and public buildings the effectiveness of industrial manufacturing facilities and the efficiency of electricity supply and end use Expectations are high for increased energy savings due to these initiatives which have already started contributing to new federal state and local laws programs and practices across the U S The development and use of alternative transportation fuels whose supply is expected to expand by by renewable energy sources and other clean energy technologies have also received more attention and financial incentives Recent policies also emphasize growing the use of coal with carbon capture and sequestration solar wind nuclear and other clean energy sources In February the United States Department of Energy proposed a set of new energy efficiency standards that if implemented will save to users of different electric machines in the United States around per year and will reduce by the year carbon emissions by the same amount as emitted by houses Mechanisms to promote conservation edit Governmental mechanisms edit Governments at the national regional and local levels may implement policies to promote energy efficiency Building energy rules can cover the energy consumption of an entire structure or specific building components like heating and cooling systems They represent some of the most frequently used instruments for energy efficiency improvements in buildings and can play an essential role in improving energy conservation in buildings There are multiple reasons for the growth of these policies and programs since the s including cost savings as energy prices increased growing concern about the environmental impacts of energy use and public health concerns The policies and programs related to energy conservation are critical to establishing safety and performance levels assisting in consumer decision-making and explicitly identifying energy-conserving and energy-efficient products Recent policies include new programs and regulatory incentives that call for electric and natural gas utilities to increase their involvement in delivering energy-efficiency products and services to their customers For example the National Action Plan for Energy Efficiency NAPEE is a public-private partnership created in response to EPAct that brings together senior executives from electric and natural gas utilities state public utility commissions other state agencies and environmental and consumer groups representing every region of the country The success of building energy regulation in effectively controlling energy consumption in the building sector will be to a great extent associated with the adopted energy performance indicator and the promoted energy assessment tools It can help overcome significant market barriers and ensure cost-effective energy efficiency opportunities are incorporated into new buildings This is crucial in emerging nations where new constructions are rapidly developing and market and energy prices sometimes discourage efficient technologies The building energy standards development and adoption showed that of emerging developing countries surveyed have no energy standard in place have mandatory have mixed and proposed The major impediments to implementing building energy regulations for energy conservation and efficiency in the building sector are institutional barriers and market failures rather than technical problems as pointed out by Nature Publishing Group Among these Santamouris includes a lack of owners awareness of energy conservation benefits building energy regulations benefits insufficient awareness and training of property managers builders and engineers and a lack of specialized professionals to ensure compliance Based on the above information the development and adoption of building energy regulations such as energy standards in developing countries are still far behind compared to building energy regulation adoption and implementation in developed countries Building energy standards are starting to appear in Africa Latin America and Middle East regions even though this is a new development going to the result obtained in this study The level of progress on energy regulation activities in Africa Latin America and the Middle East is increasing given the higher number of energy standard proposals recorded in these regions According to the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors several codes are being developed in developing countries with UNDP and GEF support These typically include elemental and integrated routes to compliance such as a fundamental method defining the performance requirements of specific building elements However they are still far behind in building energy regulation development implementation and compliance compared to developed nations Also decision-making regarding energy regulations is still from the government only with little or no input from non-governmental entities As a result lower energy regulation development is recorded in these regions compared to regions with integrated and consensus approaches Additionally there is growing government involvement in the development and implementation of energy standards of Middle Eastern respondents of African respondents and of Latin American respondents indicated that existing government agencies such as building agencies and energy agencies are involved in implementing building energy standards in their respective nations as opposed to of European respondents of Asian respondents and of North American respondents who indicated the involvement of existing agencies Several North African nations like Tunisia and Egypt have programs relating to building energy standards while Algeria and Morocco are now seeking to establish building energy standards according to the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors Similarly Egypt s residential energy standard became law in and their commercial standard was anticipated to follow The standards provide minimal performance requirements for applications involving air conditioners and other appliances and elemental and integrated pathways However it was claimed that enforcement legislation was still required in Additionally Morocco launched a program in to create thermal energy requirements for construction concentrating on the hospitality healthcare and communal housing industries Mandatory energy standards edit Energy standards are the primary way governments foster energy efficiency as a public good A recognized standard-setting organization prepares a standard Standards developed by recognized organizations are often used as the basis for the development and updating of building codes They allow innovative approaches and techniques to achieve effective energy use and optimum building performance Besides it encourages cost-effective energy use of building components including building envelope lighting HVAC electrical installations lift and escalator and other equipment Energy-efficiency standards have been expanded and strengthened for appliances building equipment and lighting For example appliances and equipment standards are being developed for a new range of devices including reduction goals for standby power that keeps consumer electronic products in a ready-to-use mode Some devices require certain levels of energy performance from a car building appliance or other technical equipment If the vehicle building appliance or equipment does not meet these standards there may be restrictions on its sale or rent In the U K these are called minimum energy efficiency standards or MEES and were applied to privately rented accommodation in Energy codes and standards are vital in setting minimum energy-efficient design and construction requirements Buildings should be developed following energy standards to save energy efficiently They specify uniform requirements for new buildings additions and modifications National organizations like the American Society of Heating Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers publish the standards ASHRAE State and municipal governments frequently use energy standards as the technical foundation for creating their energy regulations Some energy standards are written in a mandatory and enforceable language making it simple for governments to add the standards provisions directly to their laws or regulations The American Society of Heating Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Engineers ASHRAE is a well-known example of a standard-making organization This organization dates to the nineteenth century and is international in its membership About ASHRAE Examples of ASHRAE standards that relate to energy conservation in the built environment are Standard - Ventilation for Acceptable Indoor Air Quality Standard - Energy Efficient Design of Low-Rise Residential Buildings Standard - Energy Efficiency in Existing Buildings Standard - Standard for the Design of High-Performance Green Buildings The Residential Energy Services Network is a crucial benchmark for energy reduction RESNET The Home Energy Rating System HERS of RESNET which is based on the International Code Council s ICC energy code is used to rate home energy consumption with a standard numerical scale that examines factors in home energy use About HERS The American National Standards Institute ANSI has acknowledged the HERS assessment system as a national benchmark for evaluating energy efficiency The International Energy Conservation Code IECC of the ICC requires an energy rating index and the main index used in the residential building sector is HERS The mortgage financing sector makes substantial use of the HERS index A home s expected energy usage may impact the available mortgage funds based on the HERS score with more energy-efficient lower energy-using homes potentially qualifying for a better mortgage rate or amount Mandatory energy labels edit See also Sustainability standards and certification Many governments require that a car building or piece of equipment be labeled with its energy performance This allows consumers and customers to see the energy implications of their choices but does not restrict their choices or regulate which products are available to choose from It also does not enable easily comparing options such as being able to filter by energy-efficiency in online stores or have the best energy-conserving options accessible such as energy-conserving options being available in the frequented local store An analogy would be nutritional labeling on food A trial of estimated financial energy cost of refrigerators alongside EU energy-efficiency class EEEC labels online found that the approach of labels involves a trade-off between financial considerations and higher cost requirements in effort or time for the product-selection from the many available options which are often unlabelled and don t have any EEEC-requirement for being bought used or sold within the EU Moreover in this one trial the labeling was ineffective in shifting purchases towards more sustainable options Energy taxes edit Some countries employ energy or carbon taxes to motivate energy users to reduce their consumption Carbon taxes can motivate consumption to shift to energy sources with fewer emissions of carbon dioxide such as solar power wind power hydroelectricity or nuclear power while avoiding cars with combustion engines jet fuel oil fossil gas and coal On the other hand taxes on all energy consumption can reduce energy use across the board while reducing a broader array of environmental consequences arising from energy production The state of California employs a tiered energy tax whereby every consumer receives a baseline energy allowance that carries a low tax As for usage increases above that baseline the tax increases drastically Such programs aim to protect poorer households while creating a larger tax burden for high energy consumers Developing countries specifically are less likely to impose policy measures that slow carbon emissions as this would slow their economic development These growing countries may be more likely to support their own economic growth and support their citizens rather than decreasing their carbon emissions The following pros and cons of a carbon tax help one to see some of the potential effects of a carbon tax policy Pros of Carbon Tax include Making polluters pay the external cost of carbon emissions Enables greater social efficiency as all citizens pay the full social cost Raises revenue which can in turn be spent on mitigating the effects of pollution Encourages firms and consumers to search for non-carbon producing alternatives ex solar power wind power hydroelectricity or nuclear power Reduces environmental costs associated with excess carbon pollution Cons of Carbon Tax include Businesses claim higher taxes which can discourage investment and economic growth A carbon tax may encourage tax evasion as firms may pollute in secret to avoid a carbon tax It may be difficult to measure external costs and how much the carbon tax should truly be There are administration costs in measuring pollution and collecting the associated tax Firms may move production to countries in which there is no carbon tax Non-governmental mechanisms edit

Rapid transit Personal rapid transit Category Renewable energy portal v t e Concept design for the NOAH New Orleans Arcology Habitat proposal designed by E Kevin Schopfer Arcology a portmanteau of architecture and ecology is a field of creating architectural design principles for very densely populated and ecologically low-impact human habitats The term was coined in by architect Paolo Soleri who believed that a completed arcology would provide space for a variety of residential commercial and agricultural facilities while minimizing individual human environmental impact These structures have been largely hypothetical as no large-scale arcology has yet been built The concept has been promoted by various science fiction writers Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle provided a detailed description of an arcology in their novel Oath of Fealty William Gibson popularized the term in his seminal cyberpunk novel Neuromancer where each corporation has its own self-contained city known as an arcology More recently authors such as Peter Hamilton in Neutronium Alchemist and Paolo Bacigalupi in The Water Knife explicitly used arcologies as part of their scenarios They are often portrayed as self-contained or economically self-sufficient Development edit This section possibly contains original research Please improve it by verifying the claims made and adding inline citations Statements consisting only of original research should be removed August Learn how and when to remove this message An arcology is distinguished from a merely large building in that it is designed to lessen the impact of human habitation on any given ecosystem It could be self-sustainable employing all or most of its own available resources for a comfortable life power climate control food production air and water conservation and purification sewage treatment etc An arcology is designed to make it possible to supply those items for a large population An arcology would supply and maintain its own municipal or urban infrastructures in order to operate and connect with other urban environments apart from its own Arcologies were proposed in order to reduce human impact on natural resources Arcology designs might apply conventional building and civil engineering techniques in very large but practical projects in order to achieve pedestrian economies of scale that have proven post-automobile to be difficult to achieve in other ways Frank Lloyd Wright proposed an early version called Broadacre City although in contrast to an arcology his idea is comparatively two-dimensional and depends on a road network Wright s plan described transportation agriculture and commerce systems that would support an economy Critics said that Wright s solution failed to account for population growth and assumed a more rigid democracy than the US actually has Buckminster Fuller with a drawing of his domed city proposal Buckminster Fuller proposed the Old Man River s City project a domed city with a capacity of as a solution to the housing problems in East St Louis Illinois Paolo Soleri proposed later solutions and coined the term arcology Soleri describes ways of compacting city structures in three dimensions to combat two-dimensional urban sprawl to economize on transportation and other energy uses Like Wright Soleri proposed changes in transportation agriculture and commerce Soleri explored reductions in resource consumption and duplication land reclamation he also proposed to eliminate most private transportation He advocated for greater frugality and favored greater use of shared social resources including public transit and public libraries Similar real-world projects edit Arcosanti city Arcosanti is an experimental arcology prototype a demonstration project under construction in central Arizona since Designed by Paolo Soleri its primary purpose is to demonstrate Soleri s personal designs his application of principles of arcology to create a pedestrian-friendly urban form Many cities in the world have proposed projects adhering to the design principles of the arcology concept like Tokyo and Dongtan near Shanghai The Dongtan project may have collapsed and it failed to open for the Shanghai World Expo in The Ihme-Zentrum in Hanover was an attempt to build a city within a city McMurdo Station McMurdo Station of the United States Antarctic Program and other scientific research stations on Antarctica resemble the popular conception of an arcology as a technologically advanced relatively self-sufficient human community The Antarctic research base provides living and entertainment amenities for roughly staff who visit each year Its remoteness and the measures needed to protect its population from the harsh environment give it an insular character The station is not self-sufficient The U S military delivers liters US gal of fuel and kilotonnes million pounds of supplies and equipment yearly through its Operation Deep Freeze resupply effort but it is isolated from conventional support networks Under international treaty it must avoid damage to the surrounding ecosystem Begich Towers Begich Towers operates like a small-scale arcology encompassing nearly all of the population of Whittier Alaska The building contains residential housing as well as a police station grocery and municipal offices The Line was planned as a -kilometre mi long and -metre ft wide linear smart city in Saudi Arabia in Neom Tabuk Province designed to have no cars streets or greenhouse gas emissions The Line is planned to be the first development in Neom a billion project The city s plans anticipated a population of million Excavation work had started along the entire length of the project by October However the project was scaled down in to kilometres mi long housing people In popular culture edit Most proposals to build real arcologies have failed due to financial structural or conceptual shortcomings Arcologies are therefore found primarily in fictional works In Robert Silverberg s The World Inside most of the global population of billion live inside giant skyscrapers called urbmons each of which contains hundreds of thousands of people The urbmons are arranged in constellations Each urbmon is divided into neighborhoods of or so floors All the needs of the inhabitants are provided inside the building food is grown outside and brought into the building so the idea of going outside is heretical and can be a sign of madness The book examines human life when the population density is extremely high Another significant example is the novel Oath of Fealty by Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle in which a segment of the population of Los Angeles has moved into an arcology The plot examines the social changes that result both inside and outside the arcology Thus the arcology is not just a plot device but a subject of critique In the city-building video game SimCity

implementation of thermal insulation A historic building in Ku nia Raciborska Poland during the implementation of thermal insulation leading to the destruction of the original facade Building insulation is material used in a building specifically the building envelope to reduce the flow of thermal energy While the majority of insulation in buildings is for thermal purposes the term also applies to acoustic insulation fire insulation and impact insulation e g for vibrations caused by industrial applications Often an insulation material will be chosen for its ability to perform several of these functions at once Since prehistoric times humans have created thermal insulation with materials such as animal fur and plants With the agricultural development earth stone and cave shelters arose In the th century people started to produce insulated panels and other artificial materials Now insulation is divided into two main categories bulk insulation and reflective insulation Buildings typically use a combination Insulation is an important economic and environmental investment for buildings By installing insulation buildings use less energy for heating and cooling and occupants experience less thermal variability Retrofitting buildings with further insulation is an important climate change mitigation tactic especially when buildings are heated by oil natural gas or coal-based electricity Local and national governments and utilities often have a mix of incentives and regulations to encourage insulation efforts on new and renovated buildings as part of efficiency programs in order to reduce grid energy use and its related environmental impacts and infrastructure costs Insulation edit The definition of thermal insulation edit Thermal insulation usually refers to the use of appropriate insulation materials and design adaptations for buildings to slow the transfer of heat through the enclosure to reduce heat loss and gain The transfer of heat is caused by the temperature difference between indoors and outdoors Heat may be transferred either by conduction convection or radiation The rate of transmission is closely related to the propagating medium Heat is lost or gained by transmission through the ceilings walls floors windows and doors This heat reduction and acquisition are usually unwelcome It not only increases the load on the HVAC system resulting in more energy wastes but also reduces the thermal comfort of people in the building Thermal insulation in buildings is an important factor in achieving thermal comfort for its occupants Insulation reduces unwanted heat loss or gain and can decrease the energy demands of heating and cooling systems It does not necessarily deal with issues of adequate ventilation and may or may not affect the level of sound insulation In a narrow sense insulation can just refer to the insulation materials employed to slow heat loss such as cellulose glass wool rock wool polystyrene polyurethane foam vermiculite perlite wood fiber plant fiber cannabis flax cotton cork etc recycled cotton denim straw animal fiber sheep s wool cement and earth or soil reflective insulation also known as a radiant barrier but it can also involve a range of designs and techniques to address the main modes of heat transfer - conduction radiation and convection materials Most of the materials in the above list only retain a large amount of air or other gases between the molecules of the material The gas conducts heat much less than the solids These materials can form gas cavities which can be used to insulate heat with low heat transfer efficiency This situation also occurs in the fur of animals and birds feathers animal hair can employ the low thermal conductivity of small pockets of gas so as to achieve the purpose of reducing heat loss The effectiveness of reflective insulation radiant barrier is commonly evaluated by the reflectivity emittance of the surface with airspace facing to the heat source The effectiveness of bulk insulation is commonly evaluated by its R-value of which there are two metric SI with unit K W m and US customary with unit F ft h BTU the former being times the latter numerically or the reciprocal quantity the thermal conductivity or U-value W K m For example in the US the insulation standard for attics is recommended to be at least R- US units equivalent to R- or a U value of in SI units The equivalent standard in the UK are technically comparable the approved document L would normally require an average U value over the roof area of to depending on the age of the property and the type of roof construction Newer buildings have to meet a higher standard than those built under previous versions of the regulations It is important to realise a single R-value or U-value does not take into account the quality of construction or local environmental factors for each building Construction quality issues can include inadequate vapor barriers and problems with draft-proofing In addition the properties and density of the insulation material itself are critical Most countries have some regime of either inspections or certification of approved installers to make sure that good standards are maintained History of thermal insulation edit The history of thermal insulation is not so long compared with other materials but human beings have been aware of the importance of insulation for a long time In the prehistoric time human beings began their activity of making shelters against wild animals and heavy weather human beings started their exploration of thermal insulation Prehistoric peoples built their dwellings by using the materials of animal skins fur and plant materials like reed flax and straw these materials were first used as clothing materials because their dwellings were temporary they were more likely to use the materials they used in clothing which were easy to obtain and process The materials of animal furs and plant products can hold a large amount of air between molecules which can create an air cavity to reduce the heat exchange Later human beings long life spans and the development of agriculture determined that they needed a fixed place of residence earth-sheltered houses stone houses and cave dwellings began to emerge The high density of these materials can cause a time lag effect in thermal transfer which can make the inside temperature change slowly This effect keep inside of the buildings warm in winter and cool in summer also because of the materials like earth or stone is easy to get this design is really popular in many places like Russia Iceland Greenland Organic materials were the first available to build a shelter for people to protect themselves from bad weather conditions and to help keep them warm But organic materials like animal and plant fiber cannot exist for a long time so these natural materials cannot satisfy people s long-term need for thermal insulation So people began to search for substitutes which are more durable In the th century people were no longer satisfied with using natural materials for thermal insulation they processed the organic materials and produced the first insulated panels At the same time more and more artificial materials start to emerge and a large range of artificial thermal insulation materials were developed e g rock wool fiberglass foam glass and hollow bricks Significance of thermal insulation edit Thermal insulation can play a significant role in buildings great demands of thermal comfort result in a large amount of energy consumed for full-heating for all rooms Around of energy consumption can be attributed to the building mainly consumed by heating or cooling Sufficient thermal insulation is the fundamental task that ensures a healthy indoor environment and against structure damages It is also a key factor in dealing with high energy consumption it can reduce the heat flow through the building envelope Good thermal insulation can also bring the following benefits to the building Preventing building damage caused by the formation of moisture on the inside of the building envelope Thermal insulation makes sure that the temperatures of room surface don t fall below a critical level which avoids condensation and the formation of mould According to the Building Damage reports and of building damage was caused by mould problems If there is no sufficient thermal insulation in the building high relative humidity inside the building will lead to condensation and finally result in mould problems Producing a comfortable thermal environment for people living in the building Good thermal insulation allows sufficiently high temperatures inside the building during the winter and it also achieves the same level of thermal comfort by offering relatively low air temperature in the summer Reducing unwanted heating or cooling energy input Thermal insulation reduces the heat exchange through the building envelope which allows the heating and cooling machines to achieve the same indoor air temperature with less energy input Planning and examples edit How much insulation a house should have depends on building design climate energy costs budget and personal preference Regional climates make for different requirements Building codes often set minimum standards for fire safety and energy efficiency which can be voluntarily exceeded within the context of sustainable architecture for green certifications such as LEED The insulation strategy of a building needs to be based on a careful consideration of the mode of energy transfer and the direction and intensity in which it moves This may alter throughout the day and from season to season It is important to choose an appropriate design the correct combination of materials and building techniques to suit the particular situation United States edit The thermal insulation requirements in the USA follow the ASHRAE which is the U S energy standard for all commercial and some residential buildings ASHRAE standard considers multiple perspectives such as prescriptive building envelope types and energy cost budget And the standard has some mandatory thermal insulation requirements All thermal insulation requirements in ASHRAE are divided by the climate zone it means that the amount of insulation needed for a building is determined by which climate zone the building locates The thermal insulation requirements are shown as R-value and continuous insulation R-value as the second index The requirements for different types of walls wood framed walls steel framed walls and mass walls are shown in the table Prescriptive insulation minimum R-value requirements F ft h BTU Wood Framed walls Steel Framed walls Mass walls zone Non-residential Residential Non-Residential Residential Non-Residential Residential NR To determine whether you should add insulation you first need to find out how much insulation you already have in your home and where A qualified home energy auditor will include an insulation check as a routine part of a whole-house energy audit However you can sometimes perform a self-assessment in certain areas of the home such as attics Here a visual inspection along with use of a ruler can give you a sense of whether you may benefit from additional insulation Residential energy audits are often initiated due homeowners being alerted by a gradual increase in their utility bills which often reflects the buildings attic as being poorly insulated An initial estimate of insulation needs in the United States can be determined by the US Department of Energy s ZIP code insulation calculator Russia edit In Russia the availability of abundant and cheap gas has led to poorly insulated overheated and inefficient consumption of energy The Russian Center for Energy Efficiency found that Russian buildings are either over- or under-heated and often consume up to percent more heat and hot water than needed percent of all carbon dioxide CO emissions in Russia are produced through heating and generating electricity for buildings However greenhouse gas emissions from the former Soviet Bloc are still below their levels citation needed Energy codes in the Soviet Union start to establish in norms and rules first mentioned the performance of the building envelope and heat losses and they formed norms to regulate the energy characteristics of the building envelope And the most recent version of Russia energy code SP was published in The energy codes of Russia were established by experts of government institutes or nongovernmental organization like ABOK The energy code of Russia have been revised several times since the versions reduced energy depletion per square meter for heating by and the version reduced by The code also has a mandatory requirement on thermal insulation of buildings accompany with some voluntary provisions mainly focused on heat loss from the building shell Australia edit See also Mr Fluffy and Energy Efficient Homes Package The thermal insulation requirements of Australia follow the climate of the building location the table below is the minimum insulation requirements based on climate which is determined by the Building Code of Australia BCA The building in Australia applies insulation in roofs ceilings external walls and various components of the building such as Veranda roofs in the hot climate Bulkhead Floors Bulkheads wall section between ceilings which are in different heights should have the same insulated level as the ceilings since they suffer the same temperature levels And the external walls of Australia s building should be insulated to decrease all kinds of heat transfer Besides the walls and ceilings the Australia energy code also requires insulation for floors not all floors Raised timber floors must have around mm soil clearance below the lowest timbers to provide sufficient space for insulation and concrete slab such as suspended slabs and slab-on-ground should be insulated in the same way Minimum roof insulation level by climate cool temperate Alpine reducing heat loss is the main priority Example locations Minimum insulation level total R-value m K W Roof ceiling Wall Melbourne Vic Canberra ACT Hobart Tas Mt Gambier SA Ballarat Vic Thredbo NSW These minimum insulation levels are higher if the roof has an upper surface absorbance value of more than page needed China edit China has various climatic characters which are divided by geographical areas There are five climate zones in China to identify the building design include thermal insulation The very cold zone cold zone hot summer and cold winter zone hot summer and warm winter zone and cold winter zone Germany edit Germany established its requirements of building energy efficiency in and the first energy code-the Energy Saving Ordinance EnEV which based on the building performance was introduced in And the version of the Energy Saving Ordinance increased the minimum R-values of the thermal insulation of the building shell and introduced requirements for air-tightness tests The Energy Saving Ordinance EnEV clarified the requirement of thermal insulation of the ceiling And it mentioned that if the ceiling was not fulfilled thermal insulation will be needed in accessible ceilings over upper floor s heated rooms U-Value must be under W m K Netherlands edit The building decree Bouwbesluit of the Netherlands makes a clear distinction between home renovation or newly built houses New builds count as completely new homes but also new additions and extensions are considered to be new builds Furthermore renovations whereby at least of the surface of the integral building is changed or enlarged is also considered to be a new build Therefore during thorough renovations there s a chance that the new construction must meet the new building requirement for insulation of the Netherlands If the renovation is of a smaller nature the renovation directive applies Examples of renovation are post-insulation of a cavity wall and post-insulation of a sloping roof against the roof boarding or under the tiles Note that every renovation must meet the minimum Rc value of W m K If the current insulation has a higher insulation value the legally obtained level then this value counts as a lower limit New Zealand edit Insulation requirements for new houses and small buildings in New Zealand are set out in the Building Code and standard NZS Minimum construction R-values m K W Zone and Zone Roof ceiling Walls Floors Windows and glazing Skylights Zones and include most of the North Island including Waiheke Island and Great Barrier Island Zone includes the Taup District Ruapehu District and the Rangitikei District north of latitude south i e north of and including Mangaweka in the North Island the South Island Stewart Island and the Chatham Islands United Kingdom edit Insulation requirements are specified in the Building regulations and in England and Wales the technical content is published as Approved Documents Document L defines thermal requirements and while setting minimum standards can allow for the U values for elements such as roofs and walls to be traded off against other factors such as the type of heating system in a whole building energy use assessment Scotland and Northern Ireland have similar systems but the detail technical standards are not identical The standards have been revised several times in recent years requiring more efficient use of energy as the UK moves towards a low-carbon economy Technologies and strategies in different climates edit Cold climates edit Strategies in cold climate edit Cross-section of home insulation In cold conditions the main aim is to reduce heat flow out of the building The components of the building envelope windows doors roofs floors foundations walls and air infiltration barriers are all important sources of heat loss in an otherwise well insulated home windows will then become an important source of heat transfer The resistance to conducted heat loss for standard single glazing corresponds to an R-value of about m K W or more than twice that for typical double glazing compared to m K W for glass wool batts Losses can be reduced by good weatherisation bulk insulation and minimising the amount of non-insulative particularly non-solar facing glazing Indoor thermal radiation can also be a disadvantage with spectrally selective low-e low-emissivity glazing Some insulated glazing systems can double to triple R values Technologies in cold climate edit The vacuum panels and aerogel wall surface insulation are two technologies that can enhance the energy performance and thermal insulating effectiveness of the residential buildings and commercial buildings in cold climate regions such as New England and Boston In the past time the price of thermal insulation materials that displayed high insulated performance was very expensive With the development of material industry and the booming of science technologies more and more insulation materials and insulated technologies have emerged during the th century which gives us various options for building insulation Especially in the cold climate areas a large amount of thermal insulation is needed to deal with the heat losses caused by cold weather infiltration ventilation and radiation There are two technologies that are worth discussing Exterior insulation system EIFS based on Vacuum insulation panels VIP edit Main article Vacuum insulated panel VIPs are noted for their ultra-high thermal resistance their ability of thermal resistance is four to eight times more than conventional foam insulation materials which lead to a thinner thickness of thermal insulation to the building shell compared with traditional materials The VIPs are usually composed of core panels and metallic enclosures The common materials that used to produce Core panels are fumed and precipitated silica open-cell polyurethane PU and different types of fiberglass And the core panel is covered by the metallic enclosure to create a vacuum environment the metallic enclosure can make sure that the core panel is kept in the vacuum environment Although this material has a high thermal performance it still maintains a high price in the last twenty years Aerogel exterior and interior wall surface insulation edit Aerogel was first discovered by Samuel Stephens Kistle in It is a kind of gel of which the liquid component of the material is replaced by a gas thus creating a material that is air This material has a relatively high R-value of around R- per inch which is considerably higher compared with conventional plastic foam insulation materials due to their designed high porosity But the difficulties in processing and low productivity limit the development of Aerogels the cost price of this material still remains at a high level Only two companies in the United States offer the commercial Aerogel product for wall insulation purposes Aerogels for glazing edit The DOE estimates thermal losses nearing through windows and thermal gains from sunlight leading to unwanted heating Due to the high R associated with aerogels their use for glazing applications has become an area of interest explored by many research institutions Their implementation however must not hinder the primary function of windows transparency Typically aerogels have low transmission and appear hazy even amongst those considered transparent which is why they have generally been reserved to wall insulation applications Eldho Abraham a researcher at the University of Colorado Boulder recently demonstrated the capabilities of aerogels by designing a silanized cellulose aerogel SiCellA which offers near visible transmission in addition to thermal conductivities which effectively reject or retain heat depending on the interior environment akin to heating cooling alterations This is due to the designed porosity of the SiCellA pores are smaller than the wavelength of visible light leading to transmission the pores also minimize contact between the cellulose fibers leading to lower thermal conductivities The use of cellulose fibers lends itself to sustainability as this is a naturally derived fiber sourced from wood pulps This opens the door not only to aerogels but also more general wood-based materials implementation in an effort to assist sustainable design alternatives with compounding energy saving effects Hot climates edit Strategies in hot climate edit In hot conditions the greatest source of heat energy is solar radiation This can enter buildings directly through windows or it can heat the building shell to a higher temperature than the ambient increasing the heat transfer through the building envelope The Solar Heat Gain Co-efficient SHGC a measure of solar heat transmittance of standard single glazing can be around Solar gain can be reduced by adequate shading from the sun light coloured roofing spectrally selective heat-reflective paints and coatings and various types of insulation for the rest of the envelope Specially coated glazing can reduce SHGC to around Radiant barriers are highly effective for attic spaces in hot climates In this application they are much more effective in hot climates than cold climates For downward heat flow convection is weak and radiation dominates heat transfer across an air space Radiant barriers must face an adequate air-gap to be effective If refrigerative air-conditioning is employed in a hot humid climate then it is particularly important to seal the building envelope Dehumidification of humid air infiltration can waste significant energy On the other hand some building designs are based on effective cross-ventilation instead of refrigerative air-conditioning to provide convective cooling from prevailing breezes Technologies in hot climate edit In hot dry climate regions like Egypt and Africa thermal comfort in the summer is the main question nearly half of energy consumption in urban area is depleted by air conditioning systems to satisfy peoples demand for thermal comfort many developing countries in hot dry climate region suffer a shortage of electricity in the summer due to the increasing use of cooling machines A new technology called Cool Roof has been introduced to ameliorate this situation In the past architects used thermal mass materials to improve thermal comfort the heavy thermal insulation could cause the time-lag effect which might slow down the speed of heat transfer during the daytime and keep the indoor temperature in a certain range Hot and dry climate regions usually have a large temperature difference between the day and night The cool roof is low-cost technology based on solar reflectance and thermal emittance which uses reflective materials and light colors to reflect the solar radiation The solar reflectance and the thermal emittance are two key factors that determine the thermal performance of the roof and they can also improve the effectiveness of the thermal insulation since around solar radiation is reflected back to the sky The shape of the roof is also under consideration the curved roof can receive less solar energy compared with conventional shapes Meanwhile the drawback of this technology is obvious that the high reflectivity will cause visual discomfort On the other hand the high reflectivity and thermal emittance of the roof will increase the heating load of the building Orientation passive solar design edit Main article Passive solar building design Optimal placement of building elements e g windows doors heaters can play a significant role in insulation by considering the impact of solar radiation on the building and the prevailing breezes Reflective laminates can help reduce passive solar heat in pole barns garages and metal buildings Construction edit See insulated glass and quadruple glazing for discussion of windows Building envelope edit The thermal envelope defines the conditioned or living space in a house The attic or basement may or may not be included in this area Reducing airflow from inside to outside can help to reduce convective heat transfer significantly Ensuring low convective heat transfer also requires attention to building construction weatherization and the correct installation of insulative materials The less natural airflow into a building the more mechanical ventilation will be required to support human comfort High humidity can be a significant issue associated with lack of airflow causing condensation rotting construction materials and encouraging microbial growth such as mould and bacteria Moisture can also drastically reduce the effectiveness of insulation by creating a thermal bridge see below Air exchange systems can be actively or passively incorporated to address these problems Thermal bridge edit Thermal bridges are points in the building envelope that allow heat conduction to occur Since heat flows through the path of least resistance thermal bridges can contribute to poor energy performance A thermal bridge is created when materials create a continuous path across a temperature difference in which the heat flow is not interrupted by thermal insulation Common building materials that are poor insulators include glass and metal A building design may have limited capacity for insulation in some areas of the structure A common construction design is based on stud walls in which thermal bridges are common in wood or steel studs and joists which are typically fastened with metal Notable areas that most commonly lack sufficient insulation are the corners of buildings and areas where insulation has been removed or displaced to make room for system infrastructure such as electrical boxes outlets and light switches plumbing fire alarm equipment etc Thermal bridges can also be created by uncoordinated construction for example by closing off parts of external walls before they are fully insulated The existence of inaccessible voids within the wall cavity which are devoid of insulation can be a source of thermal bridging Some forms of insulation transfer heat more readily when wet and can therefore also form a thermal bridge in this state The heat conduction can be minimized by any of the following reducing the cross sectional area of the bridges increasing the bridge length or decreasing the number of thermal bridges One method of reducing thermal bridge effects is the installation of an insulation board e g foam board EPS XPS wood fibre board etc over the exterior outside wall Another method is using insulated lumber framing for a thermal break inside the wall Installation edit This section does not cite any sources Please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources Unsourced material may be challenged and removed September Learn how and when to remove this message Insulating buildings during construction is much easier than retrofitting as generally the insulation is hidden and parts of the building need to be deconstructed to reach them Depending on the country there are different regulations as to which type of insulation is the best alternative for buildings considering energy efficiency and environmental factors Geographical location also affects the type of insulation needed as colder climates will need a bigger investment than warmer ones on installation costs Materials edit Main article Building insulation materials Thermal insulation works with mineral wool and aluminium composite mat There are essentially two types of building insulation - bulk insulation and reflective insulation Most buildings use a combination of both types to make up a total building insulation system The type of insulation used is matched to create maximum resistance to each of the three forms of building heat transfer - conduction convection and radiation The classification of thermal insulation materials edit According to three ways of heat exchange most thermal insulation we use in our buildings can be divided into two categories Conductive and convective insulators and radiant heat barriers And there are more detailed classifications to distinguish between different materials Many thermal insulation materials work by creating tiny air cavities between molecules these air cavities can largely reduce the heat exchange through the materials But there are two exceptions which don t use air cavities as their functional element to prevent heat transfer One is reflective thermal insulation which creates a great airspace by forming a radiation barrier by attaching metal foil on one side or both sides this thermal insulation mainly reduces the radiation heat transfer Although the polished metal foil attached on the materials can only prevent the radiation heat transfer its effect to stop heat transfer can be dramatic Another thermal insulation that doesn t apply air cavities is vacuum insulation the vacuum-insulated panels can stop all kinds of convection and conduction and it can also largely mitigate the radiation heat transfer But the effectiveness of vacuum insulation is also limited by the edge of the material since the edge of the vacuum panel can form a thermal bridge which leads to a reduction of the effectiveness of the vacuum insulation The effectiveness of the vacuum insulation is also related to the area of the vacuum panels Conductive and convective insulators edit Bulk insulators block conductive heat transfer and convective flow either into or out of a building Air is a very poor conductor of heat and therefore makes a good insulator Insulation to resist conductive heat transfer uses air spaces between fibers inside foam or plastic bubbles and in building cavities like the attic This is beneficial in an actively cooled or heated building but can be a liability in a passively cooled building adequate provisions for cooling by ventilation or radiation are needed Fibrous insulation materials edit Fibrous materials are made by tiny diameter fibers which evenly distribute the airspace The commonly used materials are silica glass rock wool and slag wool Glass fiber and mineral wool are two insulation materials that are most widely used in this type Cellular insulation materials edit Cellular insulation is composed of small cells which are separated from each other The commonly cellular materials are glass and foamed plastic like polystyrene polyolefin and polyurethane Radiant heat barriers edit Main article Radiant barrier Radiant barriers work in conjunction with an air space to reduce radiant heat transfer across the air space Radiant or reflective insulation reflects heat instead of either absorbing it or letting it pass through Radiant barriers are often seen used in reducing downward heat flow because upward heat flow tends to be dominated by convection This means that for attics ceilings and roofs they are most effective in hot climates They also have a role in reducing heat losses in cool climates However much greater insulation can be achieved through the addition of bulk insulators see above Some radiant barriers are spectrally selective and will preferentially reduce the flow of infra-red radiation in comparison to other wavelengths For instance low-emissivity low-e windows will transmit light and short-wave infra-red energy into a building but reflect the long-wave infra-red radiation generated by interior furnishings Similarly special heat-reflective paints are able to reflect more heat than visible light or vice versa Thermal emissivity values probably best reflect the effectiveness of radiant barriers Some manufacturers quote an equivalent R-value for these products but these figures can be difficult to interpret or even misleading since R-value testing measures total heat loss in a laboratory setting and does not control the type of heat loss responsible for the net result radiation conduction convection citation needed A film of dirt or moisture can alter the emissivity and hence the performance of radiant barriers Eco-friendly insulation edit Eco-friendly insulation is a term used for insulating products with limited environmental impact The commonly accepted approach to determine whether or not an insulation product or in fact any product or service is eco-friendly is by doing a life-cycle assessment LCA A number of studies compared the environmental impact of insulation materials in their application The comparison shows that most important is the insulation value of the product meeting the technical requirements for the application Only in a second order step a differentiation between materials becomes relevant The report commissioned by the Belgian government to VITO is a good example of such a study See also edit Energy portal External wall insulation R-value insulation includes a list of insulations with R-values Thermal insulation Thermal mass Materials Building insulation

or power station to generate electricity and useful heat at the same time Cogeneration is a more efficient use of fuel or heat because otherwise- wasted heat from electricity generation is put to some productive use Combined heat and power CHP plants recover otherwise wasted thermal energy for heating This is also called combined heat and power district heating Small CHP plants are an example of decentralized energy By-product heat at moderate temperatures C F can also be used in absorption refrigerators for cooling The supply of high-temperature heat first drives a gas or steam turbine -powered generator The resulting low-temperature waste heat is then used for water or space heating At smaller scales typically below MW a gas engine or diesel engine may be used Cogeneration is also common with geothermal power plants as they often produce relatively low grade heat Binary cycles may be necessary to reach acceptable thermal efficiency for electricity generation at all Cogeneration is less commonly employed in nuclear power plants as NIMBY and safety considerations have often kept them further from population centers than comparable chemical power plants and district heating is less efficient in lower population density areas due to transmission losses Cogeneration was practiced in some of the earliest installations of electrical generation Before central stations distributed power industries generating their own power used exhaust steam for process heating Large office and apartment buildings hotels and stores commonly generated their own power and used waste steam for building heat Due to the high cost of early purchased power these CHP operations continued for many years after utility electricity became available Overview edit Masned CHP power station in Denmark This station burns straw as fuel The adjacent greenhouses are heated by district heating from the plant Many process industries such as chemical plants oil refineries and pulp and paper mills require large amounts of process heat for such operations as chemical reactors distillation columns steam driers and other uses This heat which is usually used in the form of steam can be generated at the typically low pressures used in heating or can be generated at much higher pressure and passed through a turbine first to generate electricity In the turbine the steam pressure and temperature is lowered as the internal energy of the steam is converted to work The lower-pressure steam leaving the turbine can then be used for process heat Steam turbines at thermal power stations are normally designed to be fed high-pressure steam which exits the turbine at a condenser operating a few degrees above ambient temperature and at a few millimeters of mercury absolute pressure This is called a condensing turbine For all practical purposes this steam has negligible useful energy before it is condensed Steam turbines for cogeneration are designed for extraction of some steam at lower pressures after it has passed through a number of turbine stages with the un-extracted steam going on through the turbine to a condenser In this case the extracted steam causes a mechanical power loss in the downstream stages of the turbine Or they are designed with or without extraction for final exhaust at back pressure non-condensing The extracted or exhaust steam is used for process heating Steam at ordinary process heating conditions still has a considerable amount of enthalpy that could be used for power generation so cogeneration has an opportunity cost A typical power generation turbine in a paper mill may have extraction pressures of and psi and MPa A typical back pressure may be psi MPa In practice these pressures are custom designed for each facility Conversely simply generating process steam for industrial purposes instead of high enough pressure to generate power at the top end also has an opportunity cost See Steam supply and exhaust conditions The capital and operating cost of high-pressure boilers turbines and generators is substantial This equipment is normally operated continuously which usually limits self-generated power to large-scale operations A cogeneration plant in Metz France The MW boiler uses waste wood biomass as an energy source providing electricity and heat for dwellings A combined cycle in which several thermodynamic cycles produce electricity may also be used to extract heat using a heating system as condenser of the power plant s bottoming cycle For example the RU- MHD generator in Moscow heated a boiler for a conventional steam powerplant whose condensate was then used for space heat A more modern system might use a gas turbine powered by natural gas whose exhaust powers a steam plant whose condensate provides heat Cogeneration plants based on a combined cycle power unit can have thermal efficiencies above The viability of CHP sometimes termed utilisation factor especially in smaller CHP installations depends on a good baseload of operation both in terms of an on-site or near site electrical demand and heat demand In practice an exact match between the heat and electricity needs rarely exists A CHP plant can either meet the need for heat heat driven operation or be run as a power plant with some use of its waste heat the latter being less advantageous in terms of its utilisation factor and thus its overall efficiency The viability can be greatly increased where opportunities for trigeneration exist In such cases the heat from the CHP plant is also used as a primary energy source to deliver cooling by means of an absorption chiller CHP is most efficient when heat can be used on-site or very close to it Overall efficiency is reduced when the heat must be transported over longer distances This requires heavily insulated pipes which are expensive and inefficient whereas electricity can be transmitted along a comparatively simple wire and over much longer distances for the same energy loss A car engine becomes a CHP plant in winter when the reject heat is useful for warming the interior of the vehicle The example illustrates the point that deployment of CHP depends on heat uses in the vicinity of the heat engine Thermally enhanced oil recovery TEOR plants often produce a substantial amount of excess electricity After generating electricity these plants pump leftover steam into heavy oil wells so that the oil will flow more easily increasing production Cogeneration plants are commonly found in district heating systems of cities central heating systems of larger buildings e g hospitals hotels prisons and are commonly used in the industry in thermal production processes for process water cooling steam production or CO fertilization Rostock Power Station a bituminous coal-fired combined heat and power plant in Germany Trigeneration or combined cooling heat and power CCHP refers to the simultaneous generation of electricity and useful heating and cooling from the combustion of a fuel or a solar heat collector The terms cogeneration and trigeneration can also be applied to the power systems simultaneously generating electricity heat and industrial chemicals e g syngas Trigeneration differs from cogeneration in that the waste heat is used for both heating and cooling typically in an absorption refrigerator Combined cooling heat and power systems can attain higher overall efficiencies than cogeneration or traditional power plants In the United States the application of trigeneration in buildings is called building cooling heating and power Heating and cooling output may operate concurrently or alternately depending on need and system construction Types of plants edit Hanasaari Power Plant a coal-fired cogeneration power plant in Helsinki Finland Topping cycle plants primarily produce electricity from a steam turbine Partly expanded steam is then condensed in a heating condensor at a temperature level that is suitable e g district heating or water desalination Bottoming cycle plants produce high temperature heat for industrial processes then a waste heat recovery boiler feeds an electrical plant Bottoming cycle plants are only used in industrial processes that require very high temperatures such as furnaces for glass and metal manufacturing so they are less common Large cogeneration systems provide heating water and power for an industrial site or an entire town Common CHP plant types are Gas turbine CHP plants using the waste heat in the flue gas of gas turbines The fuel used is typically natural gas Gas engine CHP plants use a reciprocating gas engine which is generally more competitive than a gas turbine up to about MW The gaseous fuel used is normally natural gas These plants are generally manufactured as fully packaged units that can be installed within a plantroom or external plant compound with simple connections to the site s gas supply electrical distribution network and heating systems Typical outputs and efficiencies see Typical large example see Biofuel engine CHP plants use an adapted reciprocating gas engine or diesel engine depending upon which biofuel is being used and are otherwise very similar in design to a Gas engine CHP plant The advantage of using a biofuel is one of reduced fossil fuel consumption and thus reduced carbon emissions These plants are generally manufactured as fully packaged units that can be installed within a plantroom or external plant compound with simple connections to the site s electrical distribution and heating systems Another variant is the wood gasifier CHP plant whereby a wood pellet or wood chip biofuel is gasified in a zero oxygen high temperature environment the resulting gas is then used to power the gas engine Combined cycle power plants adapted for CHP Molten-carbonate fuel cells and solid oxide fuel cells have a hot exhaust very suitable for heating Steam turbine CHP plants that use the heating system as the steam condenser for the steam turbine Nuclear power plants similar to other steam turbine power plants can be fitted with extractions in the turbines to bleed partially expanded steam to a heating system With a heating system temperature of C it is possible to extract about MW heat for every MW electricity lost With a temperature of C the gain is slightly smaller about MW for every MWe lost A review of cogeneration options is in Czech research team proposed a Teplator system where heat from spent fuel rods is recovered for the purpose of residential heating Smaller cogeneration units may use a reciprocating engine or Stirling engine The heat is removed from the exhaust and radiator The systems are popular in small sizes because small gas and diesel engines are less expensive than small gas- or oil-fired steam-electric plants Some cogeneration plants are fired by biomass or industrial and municipal solid waste see incineration Some CHP plants use waste gas as the fuel for electricity and heat generation Waste gases can be gas from animal waste landfill gas gas from coal mines sewage gas and combustible industrial waste gas Some cogeneration plants combine gas and solar photovoltaic generation to further improve technical and environmental performance Such hybrid systems can be scaled down to the building level and even individual homes MicroCHP edit Micro combined heat and power or Micro cogeneration is a so-called distributed energy resource DER The installation is usually less than kW e in a house or small business Instead of burning fuel to merely heat space or water some of the energy is converted to electricity in addition to heat This electricity can be used within the home or business or if permitted by the grid management sold back into the electric power grid Delta-ee consultants stated in that with of global sales the fuel cell micro-combined heat and power passed the conventional systems in sales in units were sold in Japan in overall within the Ene Farm project With a Lifetime of around hours For PEM fuel cell units which shut down at night this equates to an estimated lifetime of between ten and fifteen years For a price of before installation For a state subsidy for units is in place MicroCHP installations use five different technologies microturbines internal combustion engines stirling engines closed-cycle steam engines and fuel cells One author indicated in that MicroCHP based on Stirling engines is the most cost-effective of the so-called microgeneration technologies in abating carbon emissions A UK report from Ecuity Consulting stated that MCHP is the most cost-effective method of using gas to generate energy at the domestic level However advances in reciprocation engine technology are adding efficiency to CHP plants particularly in the biogas field As both MiniCHP and CHP have been shown to reduce emissions they could play a large role in the field of CO reduction from buildings where more than of emissions can be saved using CHP in buildings The University of Cambridge reported a cost-effective steam engine MicroCHP prototype in which has the potential to be commercially competitive in the following decades Quite recently in some private homes fuel cell micro-CHP plants can now be found which can operate on hydrogen or other fuels as natural gas or LPG When running on natural gas it relies on steam reforming of natural gas to convert the natural gas to hydrogen prior to use in the fuel cell This hence still emits CO see reaction but temporarily running on this can be a good solution until the point where the hydrogen is starting to be distributed through the natural gas piping system Another MicroCHP example is a natural gas or propane fueled Electricity Producing Condensing Furnace It combines the fuel saving technique of cogeneration meaning producing electric power and useful heat from a single source of combustion The condensing furnace is a forced-air gas system with a secondary heat exchanger that allows heat to be extracted from combustion products down to the ambient temperature along with recovering heat from the water vapor The chimney is replaced by a water drain and vent to the side of the building Trigeneration edit Trigeneration cycle A plant producing electricity heat and cold is called a trigeneration or polygeneration plant Cogeneration systems linked to absorption chillers or adsorption chillers use waste heat for refrigeration Combined heat and power district heating edit See also District heating In the United States Consolidated Edison distributes billion kilograms of F C steam each year through its seven cogeneration plants to buildings in Manhattan the biggest steam district in the United States The peak delivery is million pounds per hour or approximately GW Industrial CHP edit Cogeneration is still common in pulp and paper mills refineries and chemical plants In this industrial cogeneration CHP the heat is typically recovered at higher temperatures above C and used for process steam or drying duties This is more valuable and flexible than low-grade waste heat but there is a slight loss of power generation The increased focus on sustainability has made industrial CHP more attractive as it substantially reduces carbon footprint compared to generating steam or burning fuel on-site and importing electric power from the grid Smaller industrial co-generation units have an output capacity of MW and represent a viable off-grid option for a variety of remote applications to reduce carbon emissions Utility pressures versus self generated industrial edit Industrial cogeneration plants normally operate at much lower boiler pressures than utilities Among the reasons are Cogeneration plants face possible contamination of returned condensate Because boiler feed water from cogeneration plants has much lower return rates than condensing power plants industries usually have to treat proportionately more boiler make up water Boiler feed water must be completely oxygen free and de-mineralized and the higher the pressure the more critical the level of purity of the feed water Utilities are typically larger scale power than industry which helps offset the higher capital costs of high pressure Utilities are less likely to have sharp load swings than industrial operations which deal with shutting down or starting up units that may represent a significant percent of either steam or power demand Heat recovery steam generators edit A heat recovery steam generator HRSG is a steam boiler that uses hot exhaust gases from the gas turbines or reciprocating engines in a CHP plant to heat up water and generate steam The steam in turn drives a steam turbine or is used in industrial processes that require heat HRSGs used in the CHP industry are distinguished from conventional steam generators by the following main features The HRSG is designed based upon the specific features of the gas turbine or reciprocating engine that it will be coupled to Since the exhaust gas temperature is relatively low heat transmission is accomplished mainly through convection The exhaust gas velocity is limited by the need to keep head losses down Thus the transmission coefficient is low which calls for a large heating surface area Since the temperature difference between the hot gases and the fluid to be heated steam or water is low and with the heat transmission coefficient being low as well the evaporator and economizer are designed with plate fin heat exchangers Cogeneration using biomass edit Biomass refers to any plant or animal matter in which it is possible to be reused as a source of heat or electricity such as sugarcane vegetable oils wood organic waste and residues from the food or agricultural industries Brazil is now considered a world reference in terms of energy generation from biomass A growing sector in the use of biomass for power generation is the sugar and alcohol sector which mainly uses sugarcane bagasse as fuel for thermal and electric power generation Power cogeneration in the sugar and alcohol sector edit In the sugarcane industry cogeneration is fueled by the bagasse residue of sugar refining which is burned to produce steam Some steam can be sent through a turbine that turns a generator producing electric power Energy cogeneration in sugarcane industries located in Brazil is a practice that has been growing in last years With the adoption of energy cogeneration in the sugar and alcohol sector the sugarcane industries are able to supply the electric energy demand needed to operate and generate a surplus that can be commercialized Advantages of the cogeneration using sugarcane bagasse edit In comparison with the electric power generation by means of fossil fuel-based thermoelectric plants such as natural gas the energy generation using sugarcane bagasse has environmental advantages due to the reduction of CO emissions In addition to the environmental advantages cogeneration using sugarcane bagasse presents advantages in terms of efficiency comparing to thermoelectric generation through the final destination of the energy produced While in thermoelectric generation part of the heat produced is lost in cogeneration this heat has the possibility of being used in the production processes increasing the overall efficiency of the process Disadvantages of the cogeneration using sugarcane bagasse edit In sugarcane cultivation is usually used potassium source s containing high concentration of chlorine such as potassium chloride KCl Considering that KCl is applied in huge quantities sugarcane ends up absorbing high concentrations of chlorine This leads to dioxins and methyl chloride being emitted when the sugarcane bagasse is burned Dioxins are highly toxic and carcinogenic whilst methyl chloride causes significant ozone depletion Comparison with a heat pump edit A heat pump may be compared with a CHP unit as follows If to supply thermal energy the exhaust steam from the turbo-generator must be taken at a higher temperature than the system would produce most electricity at the lost electrical generation is as if a heat pump were used to provide the same heat by taking electrical power from the generator running at lower output temperature and higher efficiency Typically for every unit of electrical power lost then about units of heat are made available at about C F Thus CHP has an effective Coefficient of Performance COP compared to a heat pump of However for a remotely operated heat pump losses in the electrical distribution network would need to be considered of the order of Because the losses are proportional to the square of the current during peak periods losses are much higher than this and it is likely that widespread i e citywide application of heat pumps would cause overloading of the distribution and transmission grids unless they were substantially reinforced It is also possible to run a heat driven operation combined with a heat pump where the excess electricity as heat demand is the defining factor on se clarification needed is used to drive a heat pump As heat demand increases more electricity is generated to drive the heat pump with the waste heat also heating the heating fluid As the efficiency of heat pumps depends on the difference between hot end and cold end temperature efficiency rises as the difference decreases it may be worthwhile to combine even relatively low grade waste heat otherwise unsuitable for home heating with heat pumps For example a large enough reservoir of cooling water at C F can significantly improve efficiency of heat pumps drawing from such a reservoir compared to air source heat pumps drawing from cold air during a C F night In the summer when there s both demand for air conditioning and warm water the same water may even serve as both a dump for the waste heat rejected by a c units and as a source for heat pumps providing warm water Those considerations are behind what is sometimes called cold district heating using a heat source whose temperature is well below those usually employed in district heating Distributed generation edit Most industrial countries generate the majority of their electrical power needs in large centralized facilities with capacity for large electrical power output These plants benefit from economy of scale but may need to transmit electricity across long distances causing transmission losses Cogeneration or trigeneration production is subject to limitations in the local demand and thus may sometimes need to reduce e g heat or cooling production to match the demand An example of cogeneration with trigeneration applications in a major city is the New York City steam system Thermal efficiency edit Every heat engine is subject to the theoretical efficiency limits of the Carnot cycle or subset Rankine cycle in the case of steam turbine power plants or Brayton cycle in gas turbine with steam turbine plants Most of the efficiency loss with steam power generation is associated with the latent heat of vaporization of steam that is not recovered when a turbine exhausts its low temperature and pressure steam to a condenser Typical steam to condenser would be at a few millimeters absolute pressure and on the order of C F hotter than the cooling water temperature depending on the condenser capacity In cogeneration this steam exits the turbine at a higher temperature where it may be used for process heat building heat or cooling with an absorption chiller The majority of this heat is from the latent heat of vaporization when the steam condenses Thermal efficiency in a cogeneration system is defined as t h W o u t Q i n Electrical power output Heat output Total heat

input energy Electricity Heat Cooling Heat losses Electrical line losses Conventional central coal- or nuclear-powered power stations convert about of their input heat to electricity Brayton cycle power plants operate at up to efficiency In the case of conventional power plants approximately - of this heat is lost up the stack of the boiler Most of the remaining heat emerges from the turbines as low-grade waste heat with no significant local uses so it is usually rejected to the environment typically to cooling water passing through a condenser Because turbine exhaust is normally just above ambient temperature some potential power generation is sacrificed in rejecting higher-temperature steam from the turbine for cogeneration purposes For cogeneration to be practical power generation and end use of heat must be in relatively close proximity km typically Even though the efficiency of a small distributed electrical generator may be lower than a large central power plant the use of its waste heat for local heating and cooling can result in an overall use of the primary fuel supply as great as This provides substantial financial and environmental benefits Costs edit See also Cost of electricity by source Typically for a gas-fired plant the fully installed cost per kW electrical is around kW US which is comparable with large central power stations History edit Cogeneration in Europe edit A cogeneration thermal power plant in Ferrera Erbognone PV Italy This section needs to be updated Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information May The EU has actively incorporated cogeneration into its energy policy via the CHP Directive In September at a hearing of the European Parliament s Urban Lodgment Intergroup Energy Commissioner Andris Piebalgs is quoted as saying security of supply really starts with energy efficiency Energy efficiency and cogeneration are recognized in the opening paragraphs of the European Union s Cogeneration Directive EC This directive intends to support cogeneration and establish a method for calculating cogeneration abilities per country The development of cogeneration has been very uneven over the years and has been dominated throughout the last decades by national circumstances The European Union generates of its electricity using cogeneration However there is large difference between Member States with variations of the energy savings between and Europe has the three countries with the world s most intensive cogeneration economies Denmark the Netherlands and Finland Of the TWh of electrical power generated by conventional thermal power plants in Finland in was cogeneration Other European countries are also making great efforts to increase efficiency Germany reported that at present over of the country s total electricity demand could be provided through cogeneration So far Germany has set the target to double its electricity cogeneration from of the country s electricity to of the country s electricity by and has passed supporting legislation accordingly The UK is also actively supporting combined heat and power In light of UK s goal to achieve a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions by the government has set the target to source at least of its government electricity use from CHP by Other UK measures to encourage CHP growth are financial incentives grant support a greater regulatory framework and government leadership and partnership According to the IEA modeling of cogeneration expansion for the G countries the expansion of cogeneration in France Germany Italy and the UK alone would effectively double the existing primary fuel savings by This would increase Europe s savings from today s Twh to Twh in It would also result in a to increase in each country s total cogenerated electricity by Governments are being assisted in their CHP endeavors by organizations like COGEN Europe who serve as an information hub for the most recent updates within Europe s energy policy COGEN is Europe s umbrella organization representing the interests of the cogeneration industry The European public private partnership Fuel Cells and Hydrogen Joint Undertaking Seventh Framework Programme project ene field deploys in up residential fuel cell Combined Heat and Power micro-CHP installations in states Per the first installations have taken place Cogeneration in the United Kingdom edit In the United Kingdom the Combined Heat and Power Quality Assurance scheme regulates the combined production of heat and power It was introduced in It defines through calculation of inputs and outputs Good Quality CHP in terms of the achievement of primary energy savings against conventional separate generation of heat and electricity Compliance with Combined Heat and Power Quality Assurance is required for cogeneration installations to be eligible for government subsidies and tax incentives Cogeneration in the United States edit The MW Kendall Cogeneration Station plant in Cambridge Massachusetts Perhaps the first modern use of energy recycling was done by Thomas Edison His Pearl Street Station the world s first commercial power plant was a combined heat and power plant producing both electricity and thermal energy while using waste heat to warm neighboring buildings Recycling allowed Edison s plant to achieve approximately percent efficiency By the early s regulations emerged to promote rural electrification through the construction of centralized plants managed by regional utilities These regulations not only promoted electrification throughout the countryside but they also discouraged decentralized power generation such as cogeneration By Congress recognized that efficiency at central power plants had stagnated and sought to encourage improved efficiency with the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act PURPA which encouraged utilities to buy power from other energy producers Cogeneration plants proliferated soon producing about of all energy in the United States However the bill left implementation and enforcement up to individual states resulting in little or nothing being done in many parts of the

    "content": "Compact fluorescent lamp - Wikipedia Jump to content From Wikipedia the free encyclopedia Fluorescent lamps with folded tubes often with built-in ballast Compact fluorescent lamp CFL examples The tubular-form CFL is one of the most popular types in Europe CFL with GU lamp fitting Comparison of CFLs with A compact fluorescent lamp CFL also called compact fluorescent light energy-saving light and compact fluorescent tube is a fluorescent lamp designed to replace an incandescent light bulb some types fit into light fixtures designed for incandescent bulbs The lamps use a tube that is curved or folded to fit into the space of an incandescent bulb and a compact electronic ballast in the base of the lamp Compared to general-service incandescent lamps giving the same amount of visible light CFLs use one-forth to one-third the electric power and last eight to fifteen times longer A CFL has a higher purchase price than an incandescent lamp but can save over five times its purchase price in electricity costs over the lamp s lifetime Like all fluorescent lamps CFLs contain toxic mercury which complicates their disposal In many countries governments have banned the disposal of CFLs together with regular garbage These countries have established special collection systems for CFLs and other hazardous waste The principle of operation remains the same as in other fluorescent lighting electrons that are bound to mercury atoms are excited to states where they will radiate ultraviolet light as they return to a lower energy level this emitted ultraviolet light is converted into visible light as it strikes the fluorescent coating CFLs radiate a spectral power distribution that is different from that of incandescent lamps Improved phosphor formulations have improved the perceived color of the light emitted by CFLs so that some sources rate the best soft white CFLs as subjectively similar in color to standard incandescent lamps White LED lamps compete with CFLs for high-efficiency lighting General Electric has since stopped production of domestic CFL lamps in the United States in favour of LEDs History edit Early fluorescent lights edit The parent to the modern fluorescent lamp was invented in the s by Peter Cooper Hewitt The Cooper Hewitt lamps were used for photographic studios and industries Edmund Germer Friedrich Meyer and Hans Spanner patented a high-pressure vapor lamp in George Inman later teamed with General Electric to create a practical fluorescent lamp sold in and patented in Circular and U-shaped lamps were devised to reduce the length of fluorescent light fixtures The first fluorescent light bulb and fixture were displayed to the general public at the New York World s Fair Development of compact fluorescent lamp edit The spiral CFL was invented in by Edward E Hammer an engineer with General Electric in response to the oil crisis Although the design met its goals it would have cost GE about million to build new factories to produce the lamps and thus the invention was shelved The design was eventually copied by others In Philips introduced its model SL which was a screw-in or bayonet mount lamp with integral magnetic ballast The lamp used a folded T tube stable tri-color phosphors and a mercury amalgam This was the first successful screw-in replacement for an incandescent lamp using new rare earth aluminum lattice phosphors to solve the problem of lumen depreciation that would normally occur quickly in such a thin tube however it was not widely adopted because of its large size weight over half a kilogram pronounced Hz flicker and -minute warm up time It was based on the SL prototype from In Osram started selling its model Dulux EL which was the first CFL to include an electronic ballast Volume was an issue in CFL development since the fluorescent lamps had to fit in the same volume as comparable incandescent lamps This required the development of new high-efficacy phosphors that could withstand more power per unit area than the phosphors used in older larger fluorescent tubes Mainstream success edit In helical CFLs manufactured in China by Shanghai Xiangshan became commercially available They were first proposed by General Electric who saw difficulties bending glass tubes into spirals using automated machinery Xiangshan solved this problem by bending the tubes by hand made possible by the then-low labor costs in China Since that time sales steadily increased The phosphor coating in spiral CFLs is uneven being thicker at the bottom than at the top owing to the effect of gravity during the coating process Although their popularity varied across countries in China CFLs were the dominant technology in the residential segment in Competition from LED lighting and commercial decline edit Philips Lighting ceased research on compact fluorescent lamps in and began devoting the bulk of its research and development budget to solid-state lighting such as LED lighting The rise of LED lighting however significantly affected CFL sales and production As a result of decreasing cost and better features customers increasingly migrated toward LEDs In India nearly per cent of the lighting market has been taken over by LEDs by LED prices fell well below US for a basic bulb in In the United States CFLs were also facing the possibility of proposed regulations for that would create difficulty qualifying for the Energy Star rating In early General Electric announced it would phase out CFL production in the US On September the EU banned the export import manufacture and sale of all compact fluorescent lamps with integrated ballasts Philips SL an early CFL A helical integrated CFL one of the most popular designs in North America since when a Chinese firm marketed the first successful design Pattern edit There are two types of CFLs integrated and non-integrated lamps where CFL-i denotes an integrated ballast and CFL-ni denotes a non-integrated ballast Integrated lamps combine the tube and ballast in a single unit These lamps allow consumers to replace incandescent lamps easily with CFLs Integrated CFLs work well in many standard incandescent light fixtures reducing the cost of converting to fluorescent -way lamps and dimmable models with standard bases are available Non-integrated CFLs have the ballast permanently installed in the luminaire and usually only the fluorescent tube is changed at its end of life Since the ballasts are placed in the light fixture they are larger and last longer compared to the integrated ones and they do not need to be replaced when the tube reaches its end-of-life Non-integrated CFL housings can be both more expensive and sophisticated They have two types of tubes a bi-pin tube designed for conventional ballast e g with G or G d plug-in base and a quad-pin tube designed for an electronic ballast or a conventional ballast with an external starter A bi-pin tube contains an integrated starter which obviates the need for external heating pins but causes incompatibility with electronic ballasts Non-integrated CFLs can also be installed in a conventional light fixture using an adapter containing a built-in magnetic ballast The adapter consists of a regular bulb screw the ballast itself and a clip for the lamp s connector Non-integrated bi-pin double-turn CFL with G d plug-in base An electronic ballast and permanently attached tube in an integrated CFL CFLs have two main components a magnetic or electronic ballast and a gas-filled tube also called bulb or burner Replacement of magnetic ballasts with electronic ballasts has removed most of the flickering and slow starting traditionally associated with fluorescent lighting and has allowed the development of smaller lamps directly interchangeable with more sizes of incandescent light bulb Electronic ballasts contain a small circuit board with a bridge rectifier a filter capacitor and usually two switching transistors which are often insulated-gate bipolar transistors The incoming AC current is first rectified to DC then converted to high frequency AC by the transistors connected as a resonant series DC to AC inverter The resulting high frequency is applied to the lamp tube Since the resonant converter tends to stabilize lamp current and light emitted over a range of input voltages standard CFLs respond poorly in dimming applications and will experience a shorter lifespan and sometimes catastrophic failure Special electronic ballasts integrated or separate are required for dimming service CFL light output is roughly proportional to phosphor surface area and high output CFLs are often larger than their incandescent equivalents This means that the CFL may not fit well in existing light fixtures To fit enough phosphor coated area within the approximate overall dimensions of an incandescent lamp standard shapes of CFL tube are a helix with one or more turns multiple parallel tubes circular arc or a butterfly Some CFLs are labeled not to be run base up since heat will shorten the ballast s life Such CFLs are unsuitable for use in pendant lights and especially unsuitable for recessed light fixtures CFLs designed for use in such fixtures are available Current recommendations for fully enclosed unventilated light fixtures such as those recessed into insulated ceilings are either to use reflector CFLs R-CFL cold-cathode CFLs or to replace such fixtures with those designed for CFLs A CFL will thrive in areas that have good airflow such as in a table lamp Characteristics edit Spectrum of light edit Emitted visible light spectrum of an incandescent lamp mid and a CFL bottom Characteristic spectral power distributions SPDs for an incandescent lamp left and a CFL right The horizontal axes are in nanometers and the vertical axes show relative intensity in arbitrary units Significant peaks of UV light are present for CFL even if not visible A photograph of various lamps illustrates the effect of color temperature differences From left to right Compact Fluorescent General Electric W K Incandescent Sylvania W Extra Soft White Compact Fluorescent Bright Effects W K Compact Fluorescent Sylvania W K CFLs emit light from a mix of phosphors each emitting one band of color with some bands still in the ultraviolet range as can be seen on the light spectrum Modern phosphor designs balance the emitted light color energy efficiency and cost Every extra phosphor added to the coating mix improves color rendering but decreases efficiency and increases cost Good quality consumer CFLs use three or four phosphors to achieve a white light with a color rendering index CRI of about where the maximum represents the appearance of colors under daylight or other sources of black-body radiation such as an incandescent light bulb depending on the correlated color temperature Color temperature can be indicated in kelvins or mireds million divided by the color temperature in kelvins The color temperature of a light source is the temperature of a black body that has the same chromaticity i e color as the light source A notional temperature the correlated color temperature the temperature of a black body that emits light of a hue that to human color perception most closely matches the light from the lamp is assigned The color temperature is characteristic of black-body radiation practical white light sources approximate the radiation of a black body at a given temperature but will not have an identical spectrum In particular narrow bands of shorter-wavelength radiation are usually present even for lamps of low color temperature warm light As color temperature increases the shading of the white light changes from red to yellow to white to blue Color names used for modern CFLs and other tri-phosphor lamps vary between manufacturers unlike the standardized names used with older halophosphate fluorescent lamps For example Sylvania s Daylight CFLs have a color temperature of K while most other lamps called daylight have color temperatures of at least K In United States Energy Star s specification provides a set of named color temperatures for certified luminaries Energy Star color temperatures Name Color temperature K Mired Soft white Warm white Neutral White Cool white Daylight Lifespan edit CFLs typically have a rated service life of hours whereas standard incandescent lamps have a service life of or hours However the actual lifetime of any lamp depends on many factors including operating voltage manufacturing defects exposure to voltage spikes mechanical shock frequency of cycling on and off lamp orientation and ambient operating temperature among other factors The life of a CFL is significantly shorter if it is turned on and off frequently or is used in a totally enclosed fixture This happens because the electrodes in a CFL undergo sputtering every time it is turned on this also happens in fluorescent tubes Material from the electrodes is ejected every time sputtering occurs and it is deposited on the fluorescent tube s walls showing as lamp end darkening In the case of a -minute on off cycle the lifespan of some CFLs may be reduced to that of incandescent light bulbs The US Energy Star program suggests that fluorescent lamps be left on when leaving a room for less than minutes to mitigate this problem CFLs emit less light later in their lives than when they are new The light output decay is exponential with the fastest losses being soon after the lamp is first used By the end of their lives CFLs can be expected to emit of their original light output The response of the human eye to light is logarithmic That is while the human eye is highly sensitive to changes in the intensity of faint light sources it is less sensitive to changes in the intensity of brighter light sources since the pupils compensate by dilating or constricting So presuming the illumination provided by the lamp was ample at the beginning of its life and the light output of a bulb gradually decreases by viewers will perceive a much smaller change in light intensity Fluorescent lamps get dimmer over their lifetime so what starts out as an adequate luminosity may become inadequate In one test by the U S Department of Energy of Energy Star products in one quarter of tested CFLs no longer met their rated output after of their rated service life Some CFLs may lose mercury at the end of their lifespan which can cause the lamp to lose output and eventually cause it to shift to a dim pink hue Energy efficiency edit Energy use for different types of light bulbs operating at different light outputs Points lower on the graph correspond to lower energy use Further information Luminous efficacy Because the eye s sensitivity changes with the wavelength the output of lamps is commonly measured in lumens a measure of the power of light as perceived by the human eye The luminous efficacy of lamps is the number of lumens emitted for each watt of electric power used The luminous efficacy of a typical CFL is lumens per watt lm W and that of a typical incandescent lamp is lm W Compared to a theoretical -efficient lamp lm W CFL lamps have lighting efficiency ranges of versus for incandescents Because of their higher efficacy CFLs use between one-seventh and one-third of the power of equivalent incandescent lamps Of world total lighting sales to percent were incandescent Replacing all inefficient lighting with CFLs would save terawatt-hours exajoules per year of world electricity use In the US it is estimated that replacing all incandescents would save TWh yearly Since CFLs use much less energy than incandescent lamps ILs a phase-out of ILs would result in less carbon dioxide CO being emitted into the atmosphere Exchanging ILs for efficient CFLs on a global scale would achieve annual CO reductions of Mt million tons more than the combined yearly CO emissions of the Netherlands and Portugal Electric power equivalents for differing lamps Minimum light output lumens Electric power use watts Incandescent Compact fluorescent LED If a building s indoor incandescent lamps are replaced by CFLs the heat emitted due to lighting is significantly reduced In warm climates or in office or industrial buildings where air conditioning is often required CFLs reduce the load on the cooling system when compared to the use of incandescent lamps resulting in savings in electricity in addition to the energy efficiency savings of the lamps However in cooler climates in which buildings require heating the heating system must replace the reduced heat from lighting fixtures In Winnipeg Canada it was estimated that CFLs would only generate savings in energy compared to incandescent bulbs as opposed to the savings that could have been expected without space heating considerations Cost edit While the purchase price of a CFL is typically times greater than that of an equivalent incandescent lamp a CFL lasts times longer and uses two-thirds to three-quarters less energy A US article stated A household that invested in changing fixtures to CFLs would save to over the five-year life of the bulbs depending on your cost of electricity Look at your utility bill and imagine a discount to estimate the savings CFLs are extremely cost-effective in commercial buildings when used to replace incandescent lamps Using average U S commercial electricity and gas rates for a article found that replacing each W incandescent lamp with a CFL resulted in yearly savings of in energy usage reduced HVAC cost and reduced labour to change lamps The incremental capital investment of per fixture is typically paid back in about one month Savings are greater and payback periods shorter in regions with higher electric rates and to a lesser extent also in regions with higher than U S average cooling requirements However frequent on-off cycling turning on and off of CFLs greatly reduces their lifespan The current price of CFLs reflects the manufacturing of nearly all CFLs in China where labour costs less In September the Winchester Virginia General Electric plant closed leaving Osram Sylvania and the tiny American Light Bulb Manufacturing Inc the last companies to make standard incandescent bulbs in the United States At that time Ellis Yan whose Chinese company made the majority of CFLs sold in the United States said he was interested in building a United States factory to make CFL bulbs but wanted million from the U S government to do so General Electric had considered changing one of its bulb plants to make CFLs but said that even after a million investment in converting a plant wage differences would mean costs would be higher According to an August newspaper report some manufacturers claimed that CFLs could be used to replace higher-power incandescent lamps than justified by their light output Equivalent wattage claims can be replaced by comparison of actual light output emitted by the lamp which is measured in lumens and marked on the packaging Compact fluorescent lamp with wall-mounted holder Failure edit In addition to the wear-out failure modes common to all fluorescent lamps the electronic ballast may fail since it has a number of component parts Ballast failures are usually due to overheating and may be accompanied by discoloration or distortion of the ballast enclosure odors or smoke The lamps are internally protected and are meant to fail safely at the end of their lives By industry associations were working toward advising consumers of the different failure modes of CFLs compared to incandescent lamps and to develop lamps with inoffensive failure modes New North American technical standards aimed to eliminate smoke or excess heat at the end of lamp life Dimming edit Dimmable integrated helical CFL that dims comparable to standard light bulb dimming properties Only some CFLs are labeled for dimming control Using a dimmer with a standard CFL is ineffective and can shorten bulb life and void the warranty Dimmable CFLs are available The dimmer switch used in conjunction with a dimmable CFL must be matched to its power consumption range many dimmers installed for use with incandescent bulbs do not function acceptably below W whereas CFL applications commonly draw power in the range W Dimmable CFLs have been marketed before suitable dimmers are available The dimming range of CFLs is usually between and unreliable source but many modern CFLs have a dimmable range of to more akin to that of incandescent lights There are two types of dimmable CFL on the market Standard dimmable CFLs and switch-dimmable CFLs The latter use a standard light switch and the on-board electronics chooses the light output level based on the number of times the switch is turned on and off quickly Dimmable CFLs are not a replacement for incandescent fixtures that are dimmed for mood scenes such as wall sconces in a dining area Below the limit the lamp may remain at or flicker or the starter circuitry may stop and restart Above the bulb may operate at However recent products have solved these problems so that they perform more like incandescent lamps Dimmable CFLs are more expensive than standard CFLs due to the additional circuitry Cold-cathode CFLs can be dimmed to low levels making them popular replacements for incandescent bulbs on dimmer circuits When a CFL is dimmed its color temperature warmth stays the same This is counter to incandescent light sources where color gets redder as the light source gets dimmer The Kruithof curve from described an empirical relationship between intensity and color temperature of visually pleasing light sources citation needed Power factor edit Voltage and current for a V Hz -watt compact fluorescent lamp Because the current is heavily distorted the power factor of this lamp is only The lamp takes watts but volt-amperes due to this distortion The input stage of a CFL is a rectifier which presents a non-linear load to the power supply and introduces harmonic distortion on the current drawn from the supply The use of CFLs in homes has no appreciable effect on power quality but significant quantities of them in a large facility can have an adverse effect The power factor of CFLs does not significantly affect their energy-saving benefits for individual consumers but their use in large numbers such as in commercial applications or across millions of homes in a distribution system could require infrastructure upgrades In such cases CFLs with low below percent total harmonic distortion THD and power factors greater than should be selected Infrared signals edit Electronic devices operated by infrared remote control can interpret the infrared light emitted by CFLs as a signal this may limit the use of CFLs near televisions radios remote controls or mobile phones Energy Star certified CFLs must meet FCC standards and so are required to list all known incompatibilities on the package Outdoor use edit A CFL used outside of a building CFLs are generally not designed or rated for outdoor use and some will not start in cold weather CFLs are available with cold-weather ballasts which may be rated to as low as C F Light output during the first few minutes of operation is limited at low temperatures before reaching full brightness Cold-cathode CFLs will start and perform in a wide range of temperatures due to their different design Starting time edit Incandescent lamps reach full brightness a fraction of a second after being switched on As of update CFLs turn on within a second but many still take time to achieve full brightness The light color may be slightly different immediately after being turned on Some CFLs are marketed as instant on and have no noticeable warm-up period but others can take up to a minute to reach full brightness or longer in very cold temperatures Some that use a mercury amalgam can take up to three minutes to reach full output This and the shorter life of CFLs when turned on and off for short periods may make CFLs less suitable for applications such as motion-activated lighting Hybrid lamps combining a halogen lamp with a CFL are available where warm up time is unacceptable The halogen lamp lights immediately and is switched off once the CFL has reached full brightness Health and environmental impact edit Main article Fluorescent lamps and health Closed double-envelope CFL General edit According to the European Commission Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks SCENIHR in CFLs may pose an added health risk due to the ultraviolet and blue light emitted This radiation could aggravate symptoms in people who already suffer skin conditions that make them exceptionally sensitive to light The light emitted by some single-envelope CFLs at distances of less than cm in could lead to ultraviolet exposures approaching the current workplace limit set to protect workers from skin and retinal damage However industry sources claim the UV radiation received from CFLs is too small to contribute to skin cancer and the use of double-envelope CFLs largely or entirely mitigates any other risks Tests have shown that radiation exposure from CFLs is negligible at centimeter distance from the source At closer distances comparisons show that CFLs emit less UVA long wavelength radiation than incandescent light bulbs They do however emit higher levels of UVB short wavelength radiation UVB can penetrate deep into the skin while sufficient levels of UVA can burn superficial layers Closed double-envelope CFLs are shielded and emit a lower total UV radiation compared to incandescent or halogen bulbs of a similar wattage For the average user UV radiation from indoor lights does not appear to be a concern For those with skin sensitivity long term indoor exposure may be a concern in which case they may want to use a bulb with lower UV radiation output There seems to be more variability within bulb types than between them but the best option is shielded CFLs A study comparing cellular health effects of CFL light and incandescent light found statistically significant cell damage in cultures exposed to CFL light Spectroscopic analysis confirmed the presence of significant UVA and UVC radiation which the study s authors conjectured was attributable to damage in the bulbs internal phosphor coatings No cellular damage was observed following exposure to incandescent light of equivalent intensity The study s authors suggest that the ultraviolet exposure could be limited by the use of double-walled bulbs manufactured with an additional glass covering surrounding the phosphor-coated layer When the base of the bulb is not made to be flame-retardant as required in the voluntary standard for CFLs overheating of the electrical components in the bulb may create a fire hazard Mercury content edit Net mercury emissions for CFL and incandescent lamps based on EPA FAQ sheet assuming average U S emission of mg of mercury per kilowatt-hour and of CFL mercury contents escapes to environment after land fill disposal CFLs like all fluorescent lamps contain mercury as vapor inside the glass tubing Most CFLs contain mg per bulb with the bulbs labeled eco-friendly containing as little as mg Because mercury is poisonous even these small amounts are a concern for landfills and waste incinerators where the mercury from lamps may be released and contribute to air and water pollution In the U S lighting manufacturer members of the National Electrical Manufacturers Association NEMA have voluntarily capped the amount of mercury used in CFLs In the EU the same cap is required by the RoHS law In areas where electric power is mostly generated in coal-fired stations replacing incandescent bulbs by CFLs actually reduces mercury emissions This is because the reduced electric power demand reducing in turn the amount of mercury released by coal as it is burned more than offsets the amount of mercury released from broken and discarded CFL bulbs In July the U S EPA published a data sheet stating that the net system emission of mercury for CFL lighting was lower than for incandescent lighting of comparable lumen output This was based on the average rate of mercury emission for U S electricity production and average estimated escape of mercury from a CFL put into a landfill Coal-fired plants also emit other heavy metals sulfur and carbon dioxide In the United States the U S Environmental Protection Agency estimated that if all million CFLs sold in were sent to landfill sites around metric tons of mercury would be released of all U S emissions of mercury around metric tons that year The graph assumes that CFLs last an average of hours regardless of manufacturer and premature breakage In areas where coal is not used to produce energy the emissions would be less for both types of bulb Special handling instructions for breakage are not printed on the packaging of household CFL bulbs in many countries The amount of mercury released by one bulb can temporarily exceed U S federal guidelines for chronic exposure Chronic however implies exposure for a significant time and it remains unclear what the health risks are from short-term exposure to low levels of elemental mercury Despite following EPA best-practice clean-up guidelines on broken CFLs researchers were unable to remove mercury from carpet and agitation of the carpet such as by young children playing created localized concentrations as high as mg m in air close to the carpet even weeks after the initial breakage The U S Environmental Protection Agency EPA has published best practices for cleanup of broken CFLs and ways to avoid breakage on its web site It recommends airing out the room and carefully disposing of broken pieces in a jar A Maine Department of Environmental Protection DEP study of comparing clean-up methods warns that using plastic bags to store broken CFL bulbs is dangerous because vapors well above safe levels continue to leak from the bags The EPA and the Maine DEP recommend a sealed glass jar as the best repository for a broken bulb Since the end of the export import and manufacture of CFLs within the European Union has been prohibited under the EU Mercury Regulation Recycling edit See also Fluorescent lamp recycling Health and environmental concerns about mercury have prompted many jurisdictions to require spent lamps to be properly disposed of or recycled rather than being included in the general waste stream sent to landfills Safe disposal requires storing the bulbs unbroken until they can be processed In the United States most states have adopted and currently implement the federal Universal Waste Rule UWR Several states including Vermont New Hampshire California Minnesota New York Maine Connecticut and Rhode Island have regulations that are more stringent than the federal UWR Home-supply chain stores make free CFL recycling widely available In the European Union CFLs are one of many products subject to the WEEE recycling scheme The retail price includes an amount to pay for recycling and manufacturers and importers have an obligation to collect and recycle CFLs According to the Northwest Compact Fluorescent Lamp Recycling Project because household users in the U S Northwest have the option of disposing of these products in the same way they dispose of other solid waste in Oregon a large majority of household CFLs are going to municipal solid waste They also note the EPA s estimates for the percentage of fluorescent lamps total mercury released when they are disposed of in the following ways municipal waste landfill recycling municipal waste incineration and hazardous waste disposal The first step of processing CFLs involves crushing the bulbs in a machine that uses negative pressure ventilation and a mercury-absorbing filter or cold trap to contain mercury vapor Many municipalities are purchasing such machines citation needed The crushed glass and metal is stored in drums ready for shipping to recycling factories Greenhouse gases edit In some places such as Quebec and British Columbia in central heating for homes was provided mostly by the burning of natural gas whereas electricity was primarily provided by hydroelectric power An analysis of the impacts of a ban on incandescent light bulbs at that time introduced the notion that in such areas heat generated by conventional electric light bulbs may have been significantly reducing the release of greenhouse gases from natural gas heating Ivanco Karney and Waher estimated that If all homes in Quebec were required to switch from incandescent bulbs to CFLs there would be an increase of almost tonnes in CO emissions in the province equivalent to the annual emissions from more than automobiles Use and adoption edit Main article Phase-out of incandescent light bulbs An E Philips watt CFL CFLs are produced for both alternating current AC and direct current DC input DC CFLs are popular for use in recreational vehicles and off-the-grid housing Various aid agency initiatives exist in developing countries to replace kerosene lamps which have associated health and safety hazards with CFLs powered by batteries solar panels or wind power generators Due to the potential to reduce electric consumption and pollution various organizations have encouraged the adoption of CFLs and other efficient lighting Efforts range from publicity to encourage awareness to direct handouts of CFLs to the public Some electric utilities and local governments have subsidized CFLs or provided them free to customers as a means to reduce electric demand and so delay further investments in generation In the United States the Program for the Evaluation and Analysis of Residential Lighting PEARL was created to be a watchdog program PEARL has evaluated the performance and Energy Star compliance of more than models of CFL bulbs The UN Environment Programme UNEP Global Environment Facility GEF initiative has developed The Global Efficient Partnership Program which focuses on country-led policies and approaches to enable the implementation of energy-efficient lighting including CFLs quickly and cost-effectively in developing and emerging countries In the United States and Canada the Energy Star program labels lamps that meet a set of standards for efficiency starting time life expectancy color and consistency of performance The intent of the program is to reduce consumer concerns due to variable quality of products Those CFLs with a recent Energy Star certification start in less than one second and do not flicker Energy Star Light Bulbs for Consumers is a resource for finding and comparing Energy Star qualified lamps There is ongoing work in improving the quality color rendering index of the light citation needed In the United States new standards proposed by the United States Department of Energy could result in LED lamps replacing CFLs In the opinion of Noah Horowitz of the Natural Resources Defense Council most CFL bulbs would not meet the standards In the United Kingdom a similar program is run by the Energy Saving Trust to identify lighting products that meet energy conservation and performance guidelines The G Q and GU lamp fitting socket systems were designed to replace the traditional lamp sockets so that incandescent bulbs are not installed in fixtures intended for energy

structure in order to minimize its impact on the natural environment The basic definition of an eco-friendly hotel is an environmentally responsible lodging that follows the practices of green living These hotels have to be certified green by an independent third-party or by the state they are located in Traditionally these hotels were mostly presented as ecolodges because of their location often in jungles and their design inspired by the use of traditional building methods applied by local craftsmen in countries such as Costa Rica and Indonesia These improvements can include non-toxic housekeeping practices the use of renewable energy organic soaps energy-efficient light fixtures serving local organic food reusing linens when a guest is staying for more than one night and incorporating in-room recycling and composting programs Hotels that have these certifications and best practices can attract environmentally conscious travelers and stand out from other hotels Part of

Ecological sustainability Proven contribution to conservation Provision of environmental training programs Incorporation of cultural considerations Provision of an economic return to the community Characteristics edit Green hotels follow strict green guidelines to ensure that their guests are staying in a safe non-toxic and energy-efficient accommodation Here are some basic characteristics of a green hotel Housekeeping uses non-toxic cleaning agents and laundry detergent organic cotton sheets towels and mattresses Non-smoking environment Renewable energy sources like solar or wind energy Bulk organic soap and amenities instead of individual packages to reduce waste Guest room and hotel lobby recycling bins Towel and sheet re-use guests can tell housekeeping to leave these slightly used items to reduce water consumption Energy-efficient lighting On-site transportation with green vehicles Serve organic and local-grown food Non-disposable dishes Offers a fresh-air exchange system Greywater recycling which is the reuse of kitchen bath and laundry water for garden and landscaping Newspaper recycling program Definition edit An ecological hotel is one that is fully integrated into the environment without damaging the environment contributing in some way to progress and improvement of the local community and sustainable growth of the tourism industry The term has been used on a more regular basis as new websites devoted to the subject become more prominent and hotel owners become more interested in protecting the areas their guests have come to visit New properties are being built from sustainable resources tropical hardwoods local stone and designed to better blend in with their environment They are also being run on eco-friendly principles such as serving organic or locally grown food or using natural cooling as opposed to air conditioning Ecolabels are labeling systems that show the environmental impact of good and services within regions around the world Ecolabeling of hotels in Europe edit The EU Ecolabel is an official sign of the environmental quality of services and goods established in in the European Union EU that is both certified by an independent organization and valid throughout the many member states of the European Union Any tourism accommodation operator in the EU from a large hotel chain to a small farmhouse has been able to apply for the European Eco-label since The operators must meet strict minimum standards with regard to environmental performance and health standards Tourism accommodation services need to meet certain set criteria by acquiring a minimum of points of a range of mandatory requirements These mandatory requirements include the use of renewable energy sources an overall reduction in energy and water consumption measures to reduce waste and wastewater environmental policy setting the provision of non-smoking areas and the promotion of environmentally preferable means of transport The first eco-labelled hotel in the European Union was the Sunwing Resort Kallithea located in Rhodes Greece in September Ecolabeling of hotels in South America edit In Argentina the Tourism Hotels Association AHT has created an annual award Hoteles M s Verdes greenest hotels The prize a monetary award and peer-recognition goes the best eco-hotels in the country both operating and under construction In the city of Buenos Aires has presented a new labeling system for hotels and hostels Ecosello With three levels of certification Committed Advanced and Excellence the new label aims at developing eco-consciousness among tourism operators in Buenos Aires Ecolabeling of hotels globally edit In the Global Sustainable Tourism Council Criteria was launched at the IUCN World Conservation Congress The Criteria managed by the Global Sustainable Tourism Council created a global standard for sustainable travel and tourism and includes criteria and performance indicators for destinations tour operators and hotels The GSTC provides accreditation through a third-party to Certification Bodies to legitimize claims of sustainability Additional initiatives edit See also Environmental stewardship Eco hotels may also actively help in protecting its natural environment For instance the Misool Eco Resort was started as a funding vehicle for conservation work in the area A private marine reserve which has grown to a size of acres was set up and included a no-take zone A salaried -person team of local rangers which work for the sister charity Misool Foundation patrol the area and have a base camp at Misool Eco Resort alongside additional locations in the area The Misool Foundation also has additional projects including a collaborative program to end manta hunting in Lakamera Savu Sea Alliance For the livelihood of the eco resort itself the conservation work is also of great importance as it leverages pristine reefs as its central asset the resort includes a dive center The work has even increased this asset as an increase of of biomass was observed over a -year period Besides simply protecting the environment eco hotels can also help the environment by coral growing

UN conferences Kyoto Protocol Paris Agreement Portal Glossary Index v t e An eco-city or ecocity is a human settlement modeled on the self-sustaining resilient structure and function of natural ecosystems as defined by Ecocity Builders a non-profit organization started by Richard Register who first coined the term Simply put an eco-city is an ecologically healthy city The World Bank defines eco-cities as cities that enhance the well-being of citizens and society through integrated urban planning and management that harness the benefits of ecological systems and protect and nurture these assets for future generations Although there is no universally accepted definition of an eco-city among available definitions there is some consensus on the basic features of an eco-city The world s population is continuously increasing which puts a tremendous amount of pressure on cities due to the need for new urban development There is an urgent need for cities around the world to adapt ecologically based urban development to work towards sustainability The dimensions of an ecocity provide solutions to improve the living conditions in cities by solving our current unsustainable practices The cities around the world that face the most severe challenges associated with the world s urban population are those in developing countries Eco-cities are commonly found to focus on new-build developments especially in developing nations such as China wherein foundations are being laid for new eco-cities catering to or more inhabitants History edit Origins edit In the first half of the th century the Garden City of Ebenezer Howard the urbanistic thought of Frank Lloyd Wright and Le Corbusier laid the foundations for a radical change of paradigm and a comprehensive transformation in the urban planning canon During the post-war era there was the spread of modernist tower blocks to satisfy the needs of urban slums Initial ideas behind the eco-cities can be traced back to with the formation of a non-profit organization called Urban Ecology Founded by a group of architects and activists including Richard Register in Berkeley California the organization worked at the intersection of urban planning ecology and public participation to help formulate design concepts centered around building environmentally healthier cities Some of their efforts included initiating movements to plant trees along the main streets promoting the construction of solar greenhouses developing environment-friendly policies by working with the Berkeley city planning division and encouraging public transportation In Register published the book in which the term eco-city first appeared Ecocity Berkeley The book advocated for rebuilding cities in balance with nature During the latter half of the th century concepts surrounding environmentally friendly or nature-conscious communities expanded in scope coinciding with a deeper understanding of ecological complexities Recognizing the far-reaching consequences of ecosystem dynamics pollution and natural resource depletion it became clear that a city s ecological footprint must be managed not only at the local level but also regionally and globally An example of this is Wolman s urban metabolism model which established a comprehensive accounting system for all materials and resources required by a city McHarg on the other hand emphasized the necessity of city planning that aligns with the ecological and environmental conditions specific to each site In the s there were two important events that began the initiative for eco-city developments The first event involved the publication of the Brundtland Report The Brundtland Report presented the idea of sustainable development The second event occurred in at the United Nations Earth Summit The members at the summit created a plan to apply sustainable development to our cities The Eco-cities that were developed during this time period incorporated the concept of sustainable development However a majority of the developments were created to provide a vision of an eco-city In his book Ecocities Building Cities in Balance with Nature Register re-defined his concept of the eco-city as a means to address climate change characterizing the eco-city as an urban environmental system in which input of resources and output of waste are minimized Eco-Cities in China have received strong support from the government since the early s as a policy to confront the nation s challenges with rapid urbanization and climate change China now boasts the world s largest eco-city development program with hundreds of eco-city projects currently in development Organizations edit Urban Ecology further advanced the movement when they hosted the first International Ecocity Conference in Berkeley California in The conference focused on urban sustainability problems and encouraged over participants from countries to submit proposals on best practices to reform cities for a better urban ecological balance Following this in Richard Register founded the non-profit organization Ecocity Builders to advance a set of goals outlined in the conference Since its conception the organization has been the convener of the International Ecocity Conference Series now known as Ecocity World The IECS has been the longest standing international conference series consisting of biennial Ecocity World Summits and has been held in Adelaide Australia Yoff Senegal Curitiba Brazil Shenzhen China Bangalore India San Francisco United States Istanbul Turkey Montreal Canada Nantes France Abu Dhabi UAE Melbourne Australia Vancouver Canada and Rotterdam the Netherlands Other leading figures include architect Paul F Downton and authors Timothy Beatley and Steffen Lehmann who have written extensively on the subject The United Nations and other non-governmental organizations promote and support the eco-city concept In the World Bank began its Eco Cities initiative providing financial and intellectual support to eco-city projects in developing countries Current trends edit See also Greening A video explaining the basic concept of continuous sidewalks that are used extensively in countries like the Netherlands and Denmark being safer and more consistent with sustainable transport goals Copenhagen has extensive cycling infrastructure Criteria edit An ideal eco-city has frequently been described as one that fulfills the following requirements Operates on a self-contained economy that obtains resources locally Is entirely carbon-neutral by promoting techniques like the use and production of renewable energy Is established over a well-planned city layout that promotes walkability biking and the use of public transportation systems Promotes conservation of resource by maximizing water efficiency and energy efficiency while managing an ecologically beneficial waste management system that promotes recycling and reuse to create a zero-waste system Restores environmentally damaged urban areas Ensures decent and affordable housing for all socio-economic and ethnic groups and improves jobs opportunities for disadvantaged groups such as women minorities and the disabled Supports local agriculture and produce Supports future progress and expansion over time Besides these each individual eco-city has an additional set of requirements to ensure ecological and economic benefits that may range from large-scale targets like zero-waste and zero-carbon emissions as seen in the Sino-Singapore Tianjin Eco-city project and the Abu Dhabi Masdar City project to smaller-scale interventions like urban revitalization and establishment of green roofs as seen in the case of Augustenborg Malm Sweden Cities that focus on the use of carbon-free sustainable energy and on managing greenhouse gas emissions can be referred to as zero-carbon cities Terms like low-carbon city and green city are often used interchangeably with eco-city Nature Based Solutions edit Recent scholarly focus on eco-cities establishes nature-based solutions as a defining trend in eco-city development highlighting a crucial shift from technology-centric fixes toward multifunctional green and blue infrastructure that delivers climate health and equity benefits Work led by McPherson and colleagues postulates that mainstreaming nature-based solutions through planning finance and governance is central to sustainable urban transitions globally Stormwater drainage canal in Rockingham Western Australia Carries excess rainwater away from streets towards larger bodies of water to help deal with flooding Example of blue infrastructure Eco-cities are increasingly adopting nature-based solutions to address a myriad of urban challenges at once including heat flooding air quality biodiversity loss and social well-being Because these interventions e g urban forests green roofs wetlands flood-able parks provide co-benefits that grey infrastructure traditionally cannot they are becoming ever-more important in the logistics of establishing successful eco-cities Conceptual and empirical frameworks developed in show how nature-based solutions link ecosystem services to functional urban environments offering a dedicated and consistent framework when it comes to policy and design decisions Mainstreaming mechanisms edit Mainstreaming nature-based solutions means embedding them into routine infrastructure planning budgeting regulation government and finance rather than treating them like an isolated solution Scholarly research suggests a number of mechanisms by which this level of integration can be achieved Planning regulation and policy instruments Cities are increasingly adopting policies that link nature-based solutions directly to critical issues such as climate adaptation mitigation biodiversity health equity and urban development McPherson and colleagues research shows how regions are already establishing frameworks that position nature-based solutions as part of the infrastructure tapestry Zoning and land-use regulations Changing land-use codes or zoning rules to require or fiscally incentivize green and blue infrastructure Helps to establish nature-based solutions as a necessity rather than an optional component of an urban environment Building codes and standards Mandates for green roofs street tree planning requirements and standards for stormwater retention via natural systems These embed nature-based solutions into pre-existing environments allowing for flexibility and ultimately mainstream uptake Cross-departmental coordination Because nature-based solutions overlap with multiple urban issues such as climate water health urban design transportation and biodiversity mainstreaming requires breaking departmental barriers so that regulations align across sectors A study by H lscher et al argues this is essential to mainstreaming nature-based solutions Quantifiable Indicators of Eco-city Performance edit Criteria of eco-cities can be used as measurable indicators to compare their performance over time by evaluating eco-efficiency biodiversity outcomes and eco-system service benefits Eco-efficiency edit Eco-efficiency can be measured via ratio-based metrics most often using data-envelopment analysis DEA that compare outputs that are desirable higher GDP services delivered with undesirable outputs CO PM wastewater This allows for benchmarking across multiple cities and can give a standard template for efficiency goals DEA is a non-parametric method of evaluation that uses multiple input and output variables at the same time to compare relative performance between cities Typical inputs can be about consumption of resources or polluting factors like energy use land consumption or emissions A typical output could represent desired socioeconomic outcomes such as employment service coverage and gross regional product DEA will give an efficiency score in a range from to based on the efficiency of converting inputs into positive outputs while minimizing undesirable outcomes DEA is useful for assessing urban sustainability as it accounts for multiple indicators and doesn t require an assumed production function allowing for comparison among cities at varying scales This method was applied to test across Chinese provincial capitals to show how eco-efficiency scores can expose trade-offs between economic productivity and environmental burden Biodiversity Outcomes edit Measure of the status and trends of species diversity and habitats in cities using standard biodiversity signals at a city-wide scale aligned with the IUCN Urban Nature Indexes UNI Biodiversity-focused indicators evaluate the ecology within cities including the richness of native species ratio of threatened species extent of natural habitats and the impacts on biodiversity caused by nature-based solutions NbS These metrics can help to evaluate eco-city performance by track both urban ecosystems and the effectiveness of human efforts to protect or restore them Emerging biodiversity assessment tools used by government bodies such as the City Biodiversity Index CBI allow for cities to use standardized methods to report things like species status and habitat conditions Green corridor in Fulham United Kingdom Example of green infrastructure that helps native species and general biodiversity Biodiversity indicators are more commonly now including measures of habitat connectivity and community composition Metrics for connectivity such as effective mesh size or corridor continuity are important because separation of habitats limit movement and gene flow which make species more susceptible to population decline For this reason most eco-city strategies prioritize establishing green corridors riparian buffers and tree canopy networks to conserve existing ecological systems in urban environments Cities can also keep track of changes in species abundance or functional diversity helping to understand whether ecological communities are becoming better able to withstand the pressures of their urban environment over time Nature-based solutions play an important part in producing better biodiversity outcomes Examples of NbS include wetland restoration green roofs and urban forest expansion These methods often result in improved conditions for native species due to an increase in habitat complexity Examination of data from multiple studies show that most NbS projects report positive impacts on biodiversity Standardization of reporting using frameworks like the CBI and UNI allow for comparisons globally between cities and is important to keep track of long-term progress towards conservation and restoration goals Ecosystem Service Benefits edit Ecosystem-service indicators are used to quantify the benefits that are provided by nature to urban populations such as micro-climate cooling stormwater retentions carbon reduction removal of air-pollution and access to green space These metrics are useful for evaluating the multifunctional benefits of NbS and how ecology and human well-being are linked Using ecosystem services to assess an eco-city is considered essential because they are able to show how natural systems can help cities adapt to environmental pressures like natural disasters or climate change while improving public health An example of this is micro-climate cooling which is usually measured using surface or air temperature differences between areas with vegetation and without vegetation This demonstrates how tree canopy and green roofs can reduce heat stress In a similar fashion metrics for stormwater retention quantify the amount of runoff that is avoided due to permeable surfaces wetlands and sustainable urban drainage systems SuDS These important factors can lower the risk of flooding and reduce pressure on drainage networks Carbon storage is often analyzed through urban forest inventories and modeling tools which provide insight into how cities offset emissions and increase long-term resistance to climate change Another important indicator is access to green space as it links ecological conditions to social outcomes like recreation physical health and mental well-being Many cities report the percentage of residents living within walking distance of parks and greenery as a part of their sustainability goals NbS projects are often evaluated for their ability to provide multiple ecosystem services at the same time Studies show that a single intervention like a restored stream corridor can improve water quality support biodiversity reduce heat and offer opportunities for recreational activities Category Indicator What it measures Typical unit or method Eco-efficiency Composite eco-efficiency DEA Relative efficiency of converting resources emissions into socioeconomic output Unitless DEA score Eco-efficiency CO intensity of economic output Emissions produced per unit GDP tCO e per USD PPP Eco-efficiency Energy productivity Economic output per unit of final energy use USD per GJ Eco-efficiency Air-pollution efficiency Population served per tonne of PM emitted Persons per tonne PM Biodiversity outcomes Native species richness Number and proportion of native species present within city boundaries Raw species count native Biodiversity outcomes Threatened species status Share of species classified as threatened based on IUCN criteria threatened species Red List Index Biodiversity outcomes Habitat extent and connectivity Area and spatial connectedness of semi-natural habitats and green corridors Hectares effective mesh size connected area Biodiversity outcomes Biodiversity response to NbS Proportion of nature-based solutions NbS projects that increase biodiversity NbS projects with positive biodiversity outcomes Ecosystem-service benefits Urban heat-mitigation effect Cooling provided by vegetation and green infrastructure C difference from remote sensing or microclimate sensors Ecosystem-service benefits Stormwater retention flood mitigation Runoff volume avoided due to permeable surfaces wetlands and green infrastructure Runoff volume avoided due to permeable surfaces wetlands and green infrastructure Digital and Artificial Intelligence Layer edit Artificial Intelligence AI and the Artificial Intelligence of Things have emerged as key elements of technological infrastructure for eco-cities offering sophisticated solutions for optimization mobility and resource management purposes Featuring interconnected sensor technologies and edge computing infrastructure Artificial Intelligence of Things enables cities to monitor environmental variables anticipate shifts in demand control dispersed renewable energy resources as well as govern mobility systems in a more efficient manner causing reduced harm to the environment An increasing amount of literature shows that this digit-ecological transition of recent years has progressed from the outdated concept of a smart city to an eco-city which is much more sustainable data- versus function-based using Artificial Intelligence to integrate digitization into the ecological cycles of cities including those of energy water waste and transport to name a few As argued by Bibri AI and Artificial Intelligence of Things technologies are revamping the paradigm of sustainable urbanism as they make possible the autonomous management of urban systems in an adaptive manner Machine learning applications in predictive energy management allow for dynamic balancing of demand and supply in smart grids whereas AI-enabled microgrids leverage solar wind as well as storage facilities in an urban region in an integrated manner In transport infrastructure AI applications in multimodal transport optimization as well as in autonomous vehicles result in substantially reduced congestion as well as emissions In addition to the energy sector transport and other essential sectors Artificial Intelligence of Things technologies also support urban functional capabilities in waste management water optimization and building management For example waste management systems using sensors have the ability to monitor waste levels map routes for waste collection as well as manage logistics for waste recycling in the context of a circular economy Smart-building solutions utilize AI to control lighting temperature and air-conditioning systems as a function of occupancy and environmental variables thus lowering total consumption of energy All these examples illustrate how an increasingly sophisticated digital layer is taking shape as an integral infrastructural layer of eco-cities which seamlessly integrates physical systems as well as virtual systems for sustainable functioning However this shift also raises multiple issues of an ethics technological as well as ecological nature Large-scale AI infrastructure further hampers sustainability by increasing electronic waste which could be countered if they run using renewable energy resources Data protection transparency as well as control issues continue to be significant especially in an urban scenario which increasingly banked upon privilege-based technological companies for maintaining critical infrastructure of cities Furthermore it is also possible that increased divides in digital society also widen inequality gaps by leaving Behind marginalized communities in technologically advanced urban systems These issues demand comprehensive internationally acceptable as well as ethically designed AI approaches in order to ensure sustainability from a green technological transition of cities Eco-city Framework and Standards edit With a growing popularity of the concept in the last few decades there has been an exponential growth in the number of eco-cities established around the globe To assess the performance of these eco-cities and provide future guidance the Ecocity Framework and Standards established by Ecocity Builders with technical support from the British Columbia Institute of Technology School of Construction and the Environment provides a practical methodology for this to ensure progress towards the intended goals of eco-cities The four pillars in this framework include Urban design containing criteria for access by proximity Bio-geo physical features containing criteria for the responsible management of resources and materials as well as the generation and use of clean renewable energy Socio-cultural features containing criteria for promoting cultural activities and community participation Ecological imperatives containing criteria to sustaining and restoring biodiversity Using these the International Eco-Cities Initiative recently identified and rated as many as significant eco-city initiatives at different stages of planning and implementation around the world To be included in this census initiatives needed to be at least district-wide in their scale covering a variety of sectors and have official policy status Although such schemes display great variety in their ambitions scale and conceptual underpinnings since the late s there has been an international proliferation of frameworks of urban sustainability indicators and processes designed to be implemented across different contexts This may suggest that a process of eco-city standardization is underway VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland has formulated an EcoCity concept tailored to address the unique requirements of developing countries and emerging economies Prominent reference examples include EcoCity Miaofeng in China EcoNBC in Egypt EcoGrad in St Petersburg Russia UN Gigiri in Kenya and MUF in Tanzania The modern challenges confronting cities such as climate change and its interconnected social and technological issues encompass climate mitigation urban sustainability housing affordability integrated planning energy accessibility local capacity building citizen engagement and overarching concerns like gender equality and poverty reduction VTT s EcoCity concept effectively addresses these challenges through collaborative partnerships with local stakeholders enabling tailored solutions that align with specific local socio-economic contexts Practical limits edit Richard Register once stated that An ecocity is an ecologically healthy city No such city exists Despite the conceptual ecological benefits of eco-cities actual implementation can be difficult to attain The conversion of existing cities to eco-cities is uncommon because the infrastructure both in terms of the physical city layout and local bureaucracy are often major insurmountable obstacles to large-scale sustainable development The high cost of the technological integration necessary for eco-city development is a major challenge as many cities either can t afford or are not willing to take on the extra costs Such issues along with the added challenges and limits to retrofitting existing cities contribute to the establishment of newly constructed eco-cities Along with this the costs and infrastructure development needed to manage these large scale two-pronged projects extend beyond the capabilities of most cities In addition many cities around the world are currently struggling to maintain the status quo with budgetary issues low growth rates and transportation inefficiencies that encourage reactive coping policies While there are many examples worldwide the development of eco-cities is still limited due to the vast challenges and high costs associated with sustainability Related terminologies edit Eco-cities have been developed as a response to present-day unsustainable systems that exist in our cities Simultaneously there have been other concepts like smart cities sustainable cities and biophilic cities that also strive towards achieving sustainability in cities through different approaches Owing to ambiguity in their definitions and closely related criteria defined to achieve their goals these concepts despite their varying approaches are often used interchangeably Case-studies edit Sino-Singapore Tianjin Eco-City edit A study of the Sino-Singapore Tianjin Eco-City that significant progress has been achieved through Tianjin Eco-city regarding environmental conditions ecological mobility and sustainable infrastructure but many residents harbored concerns regarding services affordability and social integration depending on community relocation and new high-income groups of migrants The Tianjin Eco-City case demonstrates that similarly socioeconomic impacts including changes in housing markets job markets and community may impact considerably the perceived and actual success of eco-city projects Haoxi Chen and colleagues found that lived experiences can offer considerably more insight into who benefits from sustainability actions by focusing their research on lived experiences which can then expose inequities that may emerge between planned and lived outcomes Criticism edit Three pitfalls edit Looking at the patterns of progress in the last few decades of city construction towards sustainability Valaria Saiu University of Cagliari poses one major criticism through the existence of a theory-practice gap caused by economic and ethical conflicts and risks that generate socio-spatial utopias She identifies three pitfalls in the concept of sustainable cities and therefore eco-cities The Idea of the City as a Business Most eco-city projects are dependent on technologies available on the global market and the city is considered as a big economic affair Often developed as techno-centric concepts these projects seek investment opportunities by public-private partnerships leading to a top-down approach This structure lacks democratic approaches in the decision-making process which further contributes to running high risks of failure especially in social terms The Oversimplification of Urban Complexity Due to the nature of current trends in measuring sustainability there has been a strong focus in the quantifiable aspects of sustainability like energy-efficiency or waste-efficiency This creates a tendency of oversimplification by neglecting the social and political aspects of the city that are unmeasurable qualitative aspects yet significant to the fundamental concept of eco-cities The Quest for the Ideal Community This section of the criticism focuses on the practical limits to merging economic goals with social goals in the urban development process Under the banner of green technology inhabitants are forced to pay higher costs for their use of facilities in eco-cities Eco-cities as isolated entities edit Another larger conceptual criticism faced by eco-cities stems from the ambiguity in the definition of sustainability as a term This has been further elaborated by Mike Hodson and Simon Marvin in their article titled Urbanism in the Anthropocene Ecological Urbanism or Premium Ecological Enclaves where they noted We have tended to refer to sustainability in a generic sense and our discussions of sustainability could be employed to anything that has sustainable as an adjective As a result of this a widespread trend has been observed in the growing number of eco-cities developed over the past two decades that claim to combat our current global climate-change challenges Many of these cities are found to be established in isolation from other existing urban centers due to the nature of their ownership citation needed Owing to this isolation internalization of resource-flows contribute towards a shallow sense of ecological sustainability in such cities With regard to methods of emissions counting cities can be challenging as production of goods and services within their territory can be related either to domestic consumption or exports Conversely the citizens also consume imported goods and services To avoid double counting in any emissions calculation it should be made clear where the emissions are to be counted at the site of production or consumption This may be complicated given long production chains in a globalized economy Moreover the embodied energy and consequences of large-scale raw material extraction required for renewable energy systems and electric vehicle batteries is likely to represent its own complications local emissions at the site of utilization are likely to be very small but life-cycle emissions can still be significant Urban ecological security and the social economic and environmental impacts of eco-cities edit Eco-cities have also been criticized to have biases towards the economic and environmental pillars of sustainability while neglecting the social pillar citation needed The practical translations of the concept have faced criticism as eco-cities have been driven by the demand for bounded ecological security By offering premium ecological enclaves factoring ecological security as an outcome of private investments driving the construction of eco-cities the existing examples of eco-cities are criticized for not being truly sustainable solutions On the contrary by placing this concept in the meta-narrative of sustainable cities these have also been further criticized for celebrating this fragmentation of society through the development of gated communities and premium ecological enclaves isolated from the real global scale of issues in today s ecological crisis For instance the eco-cities of Masdar and Hong Kong pose homogeneous visions but have been criticized to be the source of fragmentation of urban society The term Frankenstein Urbanism was used by Federico Cugurullo to metaphorically symbolize this criticism of the concept that increases social stratification in exchange for ecological security creating isolated entities that could work perfectly within themselves but fall apart when brought in

    "content": "Ecohouse - Wikipedia Jump to content From Wikipedia the free encyclopedia Home built to have low environmental impact This article is about a type of house For other uses see Ecohouse disambiguation Ecohouse near Faaker See Austria An Eco-house or Eco-home is an environmentally low-impact home designed and built using materials and technology that reduces its carbon footprint and lowers its energy needs Eco-homes are measured in multiple ways meeting sustainability needs such as water conservation reducing wastes through reusing and recycling materials controlling pollution to limit global warming energy generation and conservation and decreasing CO emissions An Eco-house could include some or all of the following Higher than normal levels of thermal insulation Better than normal air-tightness Good level of daylight Passive solar orientation glazing oriented south for light and heat Thermal mass to absorb that solar heat Minimum north-facing glazing to reduce heat loss Mechanical ventilation with heat recovery MVHR system Heating from renewable resources such as solar heat pump or biomass Photovoltaic panels small wind turbine or electricity from a green supplier Natural materials avoidance of PVCu and other plastics Rainwater harvesting Grey-water collection Composting toilet Glass that has two or three layers with a vacuum in between to prevent heat loss double or triple-glazed windows Solar panels or wind turbines Geothermal heating and growing plants on the roof to regulate temperature quiet the house and produce oxygen A vegetable patch outside the house for some food Building concepts edit Energy loss edit Thermal insulation is the main component of preventing energy loss Buildings use up enormous amounts of energy Home energy as well contributes to global warming According to The Energy Information Administration home energy contributes to of all greenhouse gases in the United States alone In construction as well of greenhouse gases is emitted Some calculations make it as much as of all the energy used when all that are well insulated and make the best use of natural light Insulation edit Increasing the amount of thermal insulation is the main component of preventing energy loss According to the EPA Office of Air and Radiation indoor air is more polluted than outdoor air and is in the top five human health risks Such pollution could be caused by toxic chemicals and mold and could lead to asthma induced illnesses Insulation in Eco-homes include draft exclusion glazing wall roof insulation and other nontoxic materials By installing insulation not only are you paying less money for heating bills but you are also reducing exposure to toxic materials such as the carcinogen formaldehyde found in manufactured wood Passive solar gain edit In the northern hemisphere a south-facing site will be a much better location than a north facing site because of access to sunlight and protection from the cold northerly wind An eco-house starts life facing the Sun Ideally the site for the house should have a south westerly aspect and be protected from the north and east It is not always possible to do this but there will usually be an opportunity to take advantage of the passive solar gain by having more glazing on either the front or the back of the building Planting trees and creating windbreaks on the north and east sides of the site can enhanced the solar gain effect by protecting the house from the cold north easterly winds Having faced the house towards the Sun high performance windows are used to draw in as much light and warmth as possible Sunlight then floods into the house and any heat generated is retained by a highly insulated building shell draught proof windows and doors and thermal mass within the building Active solar gain edit Electricity-generating solar panels on roof Orientation towards the Sun also means that active solar systems can be fitted both solar water heating panels and electricity generating solar panels on the roofs further adding to the free heat and electricity gained from the sun Living gain edit Living in the house also generates heat Active human beings can produce as much heat as a one bar electric fire Add to this heat from cooking washing lights etc and you can begin to see how an eco-house could get too hot Conventionally opening the windows reduces heat but an eco-house design could include heat recovery ventilation systems Heat recovery ventilation edit These systems extract the warm moist air from bathrooms and kitchens and take the heat out of the stale damp air before venting it outside The heat recovery system transfers this collected heat to fresh air coming into the building and distributes it to the bedrooms and living rooms which creates fresh air at room temperature An added benefit is that filters can be fitted on the air intake to provide a barrier to pollen or other irritants Living heat loss edit With the passive and active solar gains insulation draft proofed building shell and heat recovery system eco-houses could be zero heat that is in theory one should not need to keep pumping heat into them from a central heating system In practice heat loss inevitably occurs as the inhabitants open the home s doors and windows for various reasons An eco-house can incorporate design to have heating systems that can react quickly and efficiently to any changes in room temperature as well as providing a heat boost to the water temperature down-stream of the solar panels Sustainable materials edit One of the wider issues of energy efficiency is the embodied energy within the construction materials Embodied energy is the energy taken up with producing and transporting the materials used Timber edit Wood is a primary building material for eco-housing This is because trees grow using energy from the Sun do not pollute produce oxygen absorb CO provide a wildlife habitat can be replanted can be sourced locally and the timber can be put to some other use after a building is demolished Lime is a sustainable material for energy efficiency Lime edit Cement is a very useful building material and there are places where we have to be practical and use it However one alternative to cement is lime Lime has been used as a building material for thousands of years and although energy and CO are used in its production it gently returns to limestone in time taking in CO in the process Reclaimed materials edit There is also the use of reclaimed materials particularly bricks slates and roof tiles to make use of the embodied energy within these materials This can also help new buildings to blend in with their surroundings Health edit Other benefits of an Eco-house aside from having minimal heating costs are a healthy living environment The heat recovery system can eliminate dampness and hazardous mold growth The air intake filters prevent dust coming in with the incoming fresh air and the internal vacuum cleaner system extracts dust from the house and vents it via the dust collection bag and filter to the outside thus no microscopic particles of dust remain in the house Load bearing internal walls are minimised to allow rearrangements of the interior spaces and the build technology is such that local trades can carry out alterations and easy maintenance For the health of the householder and the planet an Eco-house should be built with materials that are free wherever possible from toxins or harmful products of the petro-chemical industry The better indoor environmental quality of Eco-houses has also improved health and satisfaction among occupants by reducing exposure to pollutants allergens and other contaminants According to Dr Joseph Allen and his research at Harvard T H Chan School of Public Health this leads to inhabitants of Eco-houses suffering less from sick building syndrome while maintaining positive mental and physical stability Costs edit An example of affordable eco-house Australia Generally Eco-houses are labelled as costly and expensive for the average citizen to afford Perceptions of costs are one of the main issues for many builders and owners This perception is induced by the medias coverage of Eco-houses built according to the standards of above average income homeowners According to SmartMarket Report around two-thirds of Eco-house owners who built their own homes had an annual budget of over This above average income and the freedom in building their own design furniture and materials for their Eco-houses attributes to the addition of more expensive features but this does not mean there are not affordable Eco-houses on the market It all depends where you allocate your money The Ecohome Network successfully built Canada s first LEED Platinum V home the Edelweiss House in the harsh climate of Quebec for around the same cost as a code-built home - Canada Green Building Council President Thomas Mueller called Ecohome s Edelweiss House A phenomenal achievement Builders of Eco-houses are also taking initiatives to reduce the costs associated with general homes The main factors contributing to cost for any house includes land planning infrastructure professional fees accreditation compliance fees labour materials market and occupation With this being said initiatives being done to reduce house costs for Eco-houses are directed towards materials and the market In decreasing material costs Eco-house builders use reclaimed materials Eco-house builders can also gain community land trust for ownership of land For example in Colorado US Eco-builders were able to eliminate costs by building on cheap land in an absent location while using reclaimed materials With building in a remote location the Colorado Eco-builders eliminated land costs See also edit Green home Biophilic design Green building Energy-plus-house Low-energy house First EcoHouse References edit a b c Schmidt Charles W January

    "content": "Efficient energy use - Wikipedia Jump to content From Wikipedia the free encyclopedia Methods for higher energy efficiency For other uses see Energy efficiency disambiguation Common energy efficiency label on appliances to indicate their energy efficiency in a clear manner Efficient energy use or energy efficiency is the process of reducing the amount of energy required to provide products and services There are many technologies and methods available that are more energy efficient than conventional systems For example insulating a building allows it to use less heating and cooling energy while still maintaining a comfortable temperature Another method made by Lev Levich is to remove energy subsidies that promote high energy consumption and inefficient energy use Improved energy efficiency in buildings industrial processes and transportation could reduce the world s energy needs in by one third There are two main motivations to improve energy efficiency Firstly one motivation is to achieve cost savings during the operation of the appliance or process However installing an energy-efficient technology comes with an upfront cost the capital cost The different types of costs can be analyzed and compared with a life-cycle assessment Another motivation for energy efficiency is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and hence work towards climate action A focus on energy efficiency can also have a national security benefit because it can reduce the amount of energy that has to be imported from other countries Energy efficiency and renewable energy go

Personal rapid transit Category Renewable energy portal v t e Energy productivity which measures the output and quality of goods and services per unit of energy input can come from either reducing the amount of energy required to produce something or from increasing the quantity or quality of goods and services from the same amount of energy From the point of view of an energy consumer the main motivation of energy efficiency is often simply saving money by lowering the cost of purchasing energy Additionally from an energy policy point of view there has been a long trend in a wider recognition of energy efficiency as the first fuel meaning the ability to replace or avoid the consumption of actual fuels In fact International Energy Agency has calculated that the application of energy efficiency measures in the years - has succeeded in avoiding more energy consumption in its member states than is the consumption of any particular fuel including fossil fuels i e oil coal and natural gas Moreover it has long been recognized that energy efficiency brings other benefits additional to the reduction of energy consumption Some estimates of the value of these other benefits often called multiple benefits co-benefits ancillary benefits or non-energy benefits have put their summed value even higher than that of the direct energy benefits These multiple benefits of energy efficiency include things such as reduced greenhouse gas emissions reduced air pollution and improved health and improved energy security Methods for calculating the monetary value of these multiple benefits have been developed including e g the choice experiment method for improvements that have a subjective component such as aesthetics or comfort and Tuominen-Sepp nen method for price risk reduction When included in the analysis the economic benefit of energy efficiency investments can be shown to be significantly higher than simply the value of the saved energy Energy efficiency has proved to be a cost-effective strategy for building economies without necessarily increasing energy consumption For example the state of California began implementing energy-efficiency measures in the mid- s including building code and appliance standards with strict efficiency requirements During the following years California s energy consumption has remained approximately flat on a per capita basis while national US consumption doubled As part of its strategy California implemented a loading order for new energy resources that puts energy efficiency first renewable electricity supplies second and new fossil-fired power plants last States such as Connecticut and New York have created quasi-public Green Banks to help residential and commercial building-owners finance energy efficiency upgrades that reduce emissions and cut consumers energy costs Related concepts edit Energy conservation edit Main article Energy conservation Energy conservation is broader than energy efficiency in including active efforts to decrease energy consumption for example through behaviour change in addition to using energy more efficiently Examples of conservation without efficiency improvements are heating a room less in winter using the car less air-drying your clothes instead of using the dryer or enabling energy saving modes on a computer As with other definitions the boundary between efficient energy use and energy conservation can be fuzzy but both are important in environmental and economic terms Sustainable energy edit Main article Sustainable energy Energy efficiency using less energy to deliver the same goods or services or delivering comparable services with less goods is a cornerstone of many sustainable energy strategies The International Energy Agency IEA has estimated that increasing energy efficiency could achieve of greenhouse gas emission reductions needed to fulfil the Paris Agreement s goals Energy can be conserved by increasing the technical efficiency of appliances vehicles industrial processes and buildings Unintended consequences edit Further information Rebound effect conservation and Jevons paradox If the demand for energy services remains constant improving energy efficiency will reduce energy consumption and carbon emissions However many efficiency improvements do not reduce energy consumption by the amount predicted by simple engineering models This is because they make energy services cheaper and so consumption of those services increases For example since fuel efficient vehicles make travel cheaper consumers may choose to drive farther thereby offsetting some of the potential energy savings Similarly an extensive historical analysis of technological efficiency improvements has conclusively shown that energy efficiency improvements were almost always outpaced by economic growth resulting in a net increase in resource use and associated pollution These are examples of the direct rebound effect Estimates of the size of the rebound effect range from roughly to The rebound effect is likely to be less than at the household level and may be closer to for transport A rebound effect of implies that improvements in energy efficiency should achieve of the reduction in energy consumption projected using engineering models Options edit Further information Energy conservation Energy conservation opportunities by sector Appliances edit See also Domestic energy consumption and power usage effectiveness Modern appliances such as freezers ovens stoves dishwashers clothes washers and dryers use significantly less energy than older appliances Current energy-efficient refrigerators for example use percent less energy than conventional models did in Following this if all households in Europe changed their more than ten-year-old appliances into new ones billion kWh of electricity would be saved annually hence reducing CO emissions by almost billion kg In the US the corresponding figures would be billion kWh of electricity and lb kg CO According to a study from McKinsey Company the replacement of old appliances is one of the most efficient global measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases Modern power management systems also reduce energy usage by idle appliances by turning them off or putting them into a low-energy mode after a certain time Many countries identify energy-efficient appliances using energy input labeling The impact of energy efficiency on peak demand depends on when the appliance is used For example an air conditioner uses more energy during the afternoon when it is hot Therefore an energy-efficient air conditioner will have a larger impact on peak demand than off-peak demand An energy-efficient dishwasher on the other hand uses more energy during the late evening when people do their dishes This appliance may have little to no impact on peak demand Over the period tech companies have replaced traditional silicon switches in an electric circuit with quicker gallium nitride transistors to make new gadgets as energy efficient as feasible Gallium nitride transistors are however more costly This is a significant change in lowering the carbon footprint Building design edit See also Building performance and Green building Receiving a Gold rating for energy and environmental design in September One World Trade Center is the tallest and largest LEED certified building in the United States and Western Hemisphere The Empire State Building is a large LEED certified building in New York with a Gold rating for energy and environmental design in September A building s location and surroundings play a key role in regulating its temperature and illumination For example trees landscaping and hills can provide shade and block wind In cooler climates designing northern hemisphere buildings with south facing windows and southern hemisphere buildings with north facing windows increases the amount of sun ultimately heat energy entering the building minimizing energy use by maximizing passive solar heating Tight building design including energy-efficient windows well-sealed doors and additional thermal insulation of walls basement slabs and foundations can reduce heat loss by to percent Dark roofs may become up to C F hotter than the most reflective white surfaces They transmit some of this additional heat inside the building US Studies have shown that lightly colored roofs use percent less energy for cooling than buildings with darker roofs White roof systems save more energy in sunnier climates Advanced electronic heating and cooling systems can moderate energy consumption and improve the comfort of people in the building Proper placement of windows and skylights as well as the use of architectural features that reflect light into a building can reduce the need for artificial lighting Increased use of natural and task lighting has been shown by one study to increase productivity in schools and offices Compact fluorescent lamps use two-thirds less energy and may last to times longer than incandescent light bulbs Newer fluorescent lights produce a natural light and in most applications they are cost effective despite their higher initial cost with payback periods as low as a few months LED lamps use only about of the energy an incandescent lamp requires Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design LEED is a rating system organized by the US Green Building Council USGBC to promote environmental responsibility in building design They currently offer four levels of certification for existing buildings LEED-EBOM and new construction LEED-NC based on a building s compliance with the following criteria Sustainable sites water efficiency energy and atmosphere materials and resources indoor environmental quality and innovation in design In USGBC developed the LEED Dynamic Plaque a tool to track building performance against LEED metrics and a potential path to recertification The following year the council collaborated with Honeywell to pull data on energy and water use as well as indoor air quality from a BAS to automatically update the plaque providing a near-real-time view of performance The USGBC office in Washington D C is one of the first buildings to feature the live-updating LEED Dynamic Plaque Industry edit Industries use a large amount of energy to power a diverse range of manufacturing and resource extraction processes Many industrial processes require large amounts of heat and mechanical power most of which is delivered as natural gas petroleum fuels and electricity In addition some industries generate fuel from waste products that can be used to provide additional energy Because industrial processes are so diverse it is impossible to describe the multitude of possible opportunities for energy efficiency in industry Many depend on the specific technologies and processes in use at each industrial facility There are however a number of processes and energy services that are widely used in many industries Various industries generate steam and electricity for subsequent use within their facilities When electricity is generated the heat that is produced as a by-product can be captured and used for process steam heating or other industrial purposes Conventional electricity generation is about efficient whereas combined heat and power also called co-generation converts up to percent of the fuel into usable energy Advanced boilers and furnaces can operate at higher temperatures while burning less fuel These technologies are more efficient and produce fewer pollutants Over percent of the fuel used by US manufacturers is burnt to make steam The typical industrial facility can reduce this energy usage percent according to the US Department of Energy by insulating steam and condensate return lines stopping steam leakage and maintaining steam traps Electric motors usually run at a constant speed but a variable speed drive allows the motor s energy output to match the required load This achieves energy savings ranging from to percent depending on how the motor is used Motor coils made of superconducting materials can also reduce energy losses Motors may also benefit from voltage optimization Industry uses a large number of pumps and compressors of all shapes and sizes and in a wide variety of applications The efficiency of pumps and compressors depends on many factors but often improvements can be made by implementing better process control and better maintenance practices Compressors are commonly used to provide compressed air which is used for sand blasting painting and other power tools According to the US Department of Energy optimizing compressed air systems by installing variable speed drives along with preventive maintenance to detect and fix air leaks can improve energy efficiency to percent Transportation edit Main article Energy efficiency in transport Comparison to show which form of transport has the smallest carbon footprint an indicator that is related to efficient energy use Automobiles edit Main article Fuel economy in automobiles The estimated energy efficiency for an automobile is Passenger-Mile Btu There are several ways to enhance a vehicle s energy efficiency Using improved aerodynamics to minimize drag can increase vehicle fuel efficiency Reducing vehicle weight can also improve fuel economy which is why composite materials are widely used in car bodies More advanced tires with decreased tire to road friction and rolling resistance can save gasoline Fuel economy can be improved by up to by keeping tires inflated to the correct pressure Replacing a clogged air filter can improve a cars fuel consumption by as much as percent on older vehicles On newer vehicles s and up with fuel-injected computer-controlled engines a clogged air filter has no effect on mpg but replacing it may improve acceleration by - percent Aerodynamics also aid in efficiency of a vehicle The design of a car impacts the amount of gas needed to move it through air Aerodynamics involves the air around the car which can affect the efficiency of the energy expended Turbochargers can increase fuel efficiency by allowing a smaller displacement engine The Engine of the year is the Fiat TwinAir engine equipped with an MHI turbocharger Compared with a -liter v engine the new HP turbo has more power and a better performance index The performance of the two-cylinder is not only equivalent to a -liter v engine but fuel consumption is lower Energy-efficient vehicles may reach twice the fuel efficiency of the average automobile Cutting-edge designs such as the diesel Mercedes-Benz Bionic concept vehicle have achieved a fuel efficiency as high as miles per US gallon L km mpg imp four times the current conventional automotive average The mainstream trend in automotive efficiency is the rise of electric vehicles all-electric or hybrid electric Electric engines have more than double the efficiency of internal combustion engines citation needed Hybrids like the Toyota Prius use regenerative braking to recapture energy that would dissipate in normal cars the effect is especially pronounced in city driving Plug-in hybrids also have increased battery capacity which makes it possible to drive for limited distances without burning any gasoline in this case energy efficiency is dictated by whatever process such as coal-burning hydroelectric or renewable source created the power Plug-ins can typically drive for around miles km purely on electricity without recharging if the battery runs low a gas engine kicks in allowing for extended range Finally all-electric cars are also growing in popularity the Tesla Model S sedan is the only high-performance all-electric car currently on the market Street lighting edit Cities around the globe light up millions of streets with million lights Some cities are seeking to reduce street light power consumption by dimming lights during off-peak hours or switching to LED lamps LED lamps are known to reduce the energy consumption by to Aircraft edit Main articles Fuel economy in aircraft and Environmental impact of aviation There are several ways to improve aviation s use of energy through modifications aircraft and air traffic management Aircraft

and Energy efficiency in Europe study The first EU-wide energy efficiency target was set in Member states agreed to improve energy efficiency by percent a year over twelve years In addition legislation about products industry transport and buildings has contributed to a general energy efficiency framework More effort is needed to address heating and cooling there is more heat wasted during electricity production in Europe than is required to heat all buildings in the continent All in all EU energy efficiency legislation is estimated to deliver savings worth the equivalent of up to million tons of oil per year by The EU set itself a energy savings target by compared to levels but member states decide individually how energy savings will be achieved At an EU summit in October EU countries agreed on a new energy efficiency target of or greater by One mechanism used to achieve the target of is the Suppliers Obligations White Certificates The ongoing debate around the Clean Energy Package also puts an emphasis on energy efficiency but the goal will probably remain around greater efficiency compared to levels Some have argued that this will not be enough for the EU to meet its Paris Agreement goals of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by compared to levels In the European Union of enterprises proposed energy-saving methods in listed energy contract renegotiation as a strategy and stated passing on costs to consumers as a plan to deal with energy market trends Larger organisations were found more likely to invest in energy efficiency green innovation and climate change with a significant rise in energy efficiency investments reported by SMEs and mid-cap companies Germany edit See also German National Action Plan on Energy Efficiency Energy efficiency is central to energy policy in Germany As of late national policy includes the following efficiency and consumption targets with actual values for Efficiency and consumption target Primary energy consumption base year Final energy productivity year year Gross electricity consumption base year Primary energy consumption in buildings base year Heat consumption in buildings base year Final energy consumption in transport base year Progress toward improved efficiency has been steady Some however believe energy efficiency is still under-recognized in terms of its contribution to Germany s energy transformation or Energiewende Efforts to reduce final energy consumption in transport sector have not been successful with a growth of between and This growth is due to both road passenger and road freight transport Both sectors increased their overall distance travelled to record the highest figures ever for Germany Rebound effects played a significant role both between improved vehicle efficiency and the distance travelled and between improved vehicle efficiency and an increase in vehicle weights and engine power In the German federal government released its National Action Plan on Energy Efficiency NAPE The areas covered are the energy efficiency of buildings energy conservation for companies consumer energy efficiency and transport energy efficiency The central short-term measures of NAPE include the introduction of competitive tendering for energy efficiency the raising of funding for building renovation the introduction of tax incentives for efficiency measures in the building sector and the setting up energy efficiency networks together with business and industry In the German government released a green paper on energy efficiency for public consultation in German It outlines the potential challenges and actions needed to reduce energy consumption in Germany over the coming decades At the document s launch economics and energy minister Sigmar Gabriel said we do not need to produce store transmit and pay for the energy that we save The green paper prioritizes the efficient use of energy as the first response and also outlines opportunities for sector coupling including using renewable power for heating and transport Other proposals include a flexible energy tax which rises as petrol prices fall thereby incentivizing fuel conservation despite low oil prices Spain edit In Spain four out of every five buildings use more energy than they should They are either inadequately insulated or consume energy inefficiently The Uni n de Cr

    "content": "Energy audit - Wikipedia Jump to content From Wikipedia the free encyclopedia Inspection survey and analysis of energy flows in a building Power logger connection to do an energy audit An energy audit is an inspection survey and an analysis of energy flows for energy conservation in a building It may include a process or system to reduce the amount of energy input into the system without negatively affecting the output In commercial and industrial real estate an energy audit is the first step in identifying opportunities to reduce energy expense and carbon footprint Principle edit When the object of study is an occupied building then reducing energy consumption while maintaining or improving human comfort health and safety are of primary concern Beyond simply identifying the sources of energy use an energy audit seeks to prioritize the energy uses according to the greatest to least cost-effective opportunities for energy savings Home energy audit edit A home energy audit is a service where the energy efficiency of a house is evaluated by a person using professional equipment such as blower doors and infrared cameras with the aim to suggest the best ways to improve energy efficiency in heating and cooling the house An energy audit of a home may involve recording various characteristics of the building envelope including the walls ceilings floors doors windows and skylights For each of these components the area and resistance to heat flow R-value is measured or estimated The leakage rate or infiltration of air through the building envelope is of concern which can be affected by window construction and quality of door seals such as weatherstripping This exercise aims to quantify the building s overall thermal performance The audit may also assess the efficiency physical condition and programming of mechanical systems such as the heating ventilation air conditioning equipment and thermostat A home energy audit may include a written report estimating energy use given local climate criteria thermostat settings roof overhang and solar orientation This could show energy use for a given time period say a year and the impact of any suggested improvements per year The accuracy of energy estimates are greatly improved when the homeowner s billing history is available showing the quantities of electricity natural gas fuel oil or other energy sources consumed over a one or two-year period Some of the greatest effects on energy use are user behavior climate and age of the home An energy audit may therefore include an interview of the homeowners to understand their patterns of use over time The energy billing history from the local utility company can be calibrated using heating degree day and cooling degree day data obtained from recent local weather data in combination with the thermal energy model of the building Advances in computer-based thermal modeling can take into account many variables affecting energy use A home energy audit is often used to identify cost effective ways to improve the comfort and efficiency of buildings In addition homes may qualify for energy efficiency grants from central government Recently the improvement of smartphone technology has enabled homeowners to perform relatively sophisticated energy audits of their own homes This technique has been identified as a method to accelerate energy efficiency improvements In the United States edit In the United States this kind of service can often be facilitated by Public utility companies or their energy conservation department Independent private-sector companies such as energy services company insulation contractor or air sealing specialist US State energy office Utility companies may provide this service and loans and other incentives Some public utilities offer energy audits as part of a coordinated service to plan or install home energy upgrades Utilities may also provide incentives to switch for example if you are an oil customer considering switching to natural gas Where to look for insulation recommendations Local building inspector s office Local or state building codes US Department of Energy Your local Builders Association Residential energy auditors are accredited by the Building Performance Institute BPI or the Residential Energy Services Network RESNET There are also some simplified tools available with which a homeowner can quickly assess energy improvement potential Often these are supplied for free by state agencies or local utilities who produce a report with estimates of usage by device area since they have usage information already Examples include the Energy Trust of Oregon program and the Seattle Home Resource Profile Such programs may also include free compact fluorescent lights A simple do-it-yourself home energy audit can be performed without using any specialized tools With an attentive and planned assessment a homeowner can spot many problems that cause energy losses and make decisions about possible energy efficiency upgrades During a home energy audit it is important to have a checklist of areas that were inspected and problems identified Once the audit is completed a plan for suggested actions needs to be developed New York City edit In New York City local laws such as Local Law require buildings larger than square feet m to have an energy audit once every ten years as assigned by its parcel number Energy auditors must be certified to perform this work although there is no oversight to enforce the rule Because Local Law requires a licensed Professional Engineer to oversee the work choosing a well-established engineering firm is the safest route These laws are the results of New York City s PlaNYC to reduce energy used by buildings which is the greatest source of pollution in New York City Some engineering firms provide free energy audits for facilities committed to implementing the energy saving measures found In Lebanon edit Since The Lebanese Center for Energy Conservation LCEC initiated a nationwide program on energy audits for medium and large consuming facilities By the end of LCEC has financed and supervised more than audits LCEC launched an energy audit program to assist Lebanese energy consuming tertiary and public buildings and industrial plants in the management of their energy through this program The long-term objective of LCEC is to create a market for ESCOs whereby any beneficiary can contact directly a specialized ESCO to conduct an energy audit implement energy conservation measures and monitor energy saving program according to a standardized energy performance contract Currently LCEC is helping in the funding of the energy audit study and thus is linking both the beneficiary and the energy audit firm LCEC also targets the creation of a special fund used for the implementation of the energy conservation measures resulting from the study LCEC set a minimum standard for the ESCOs qualifications in Lebanon and published a list of qualified ESCOs on its website Industrial energy audits edit Increasingly in the last several decades industrial energy audits have exploded as the demand to lower increasingly expensive energy costs and move towards a sustainable future have made energy audits greatly important Their importance is magnified since energy spending is a major expense to industrial companies energy spending accounts for of the average manufacturer s expenses This growing trend should only continue as energy costs continue to rise While the overall concept is similar to a home or residential energy audit industrial energy audits require a different skillset Weatherproofing and insulating a house are the main focus of residential energy audits For industrial applications it is the HVAC lighting and production equipment that use the most energy and hence are the primary focus of energy audits Types of energy audit edit The term energy audit is commonly used to describe a broad spectrum of energy studies ranging from a quick walk-through of a facility to identify major problem areas to a comprehensive analysis of the implications of alternative energy efficiency measures sufficient to satisfy the financial criteria of sophisticated investors Numerous audit procedures have been developed for non-residential tertiary buildings ASHRAE IEA-EBC Annex Krarti Audit is required to identify the most efficient and cost-effective Energy Conservation Opportunities ECOs or Measures ECMs Energy conservation opportunities or measures can consist in more efficient use or of partial or global replacement of the existing installation According to the audit methodologies developed in IEA EBC Annex by ASHRAE and by Krarti the main components of an audit process are The analysis of building and utility data including study of the installed equipment and analysis of energy bills The survey of the real operating conditions The understanding of the building behaviour and of the interactions with weather occupancy and operating schedules The selection and the evaluation of energy conservation measures The estimation of energy saving potential The identification of customer concerns and needs Common types levels of energy audits are distinguished below although the actual tasks performed and level of effort may vary with the consultant providing services under these broad headings The only way to ensure that a proposed audit will meet your specific needs is to spell out those requirements in a detailed scope of work Taking the time to prepare a formal solicitation will also assure the building owner of receiving competitive and comparable proposals Generally four levels of analysis can be outlined ASHRAE Level Benchmarking This first analysis consists in a preliminary Whole Building Energy Use WBEU analysis based on the analysis of the historic utility use and costs and the comparison of the performances of the buildings to those of similar buildings This benchmarking of the studied installation allows determining if further analysis is required Level I Walk-through audit Preliminary analysis made to assess building energy efficiency to identify not only simple and low-cost improvements but also a list of energy conservation measures ECMs or energy conservation opportunities ECOs to orient the future detailed audit This inspection is based on visual verifications study of installed equipment and operating data and detailed analysis of recorded energy consumption collected during the benchmarking phase Level II Detailed General energy audit Based on the results of the pre-audit this type of energy audit consists in energy use survey in order to provide a comprehensive analysis of the studied installation a more detailed analysis of the facility a breakdown of the energy use and a first quantitative evaluation of the ECOs ECMs selected to correct the defects or improve the existing installation This level of analysis can involve advanced on-site measurements and sophisticated computer-based simulation tools to evaluate precisely the selected energy retrofits Level III Investment-Grade audit Detailed Analysis of Capital-Intensive Modifications focusing on potential costly ECOs requiring rigorous engineering study Benchmarking edit The impossibility of describing all possible situations that might be encountered during an audit means that it is necessary to find a way of describing what constitutes good average and bad energy performance across a range of situations The aim of benchmarking is to answer this question Benchmarking mainly consists in comparing the measured consumption with reference consumption of other similar buildings or generated by simulation tools to identify excessive or unacceptable running costs As mentioned before benchmarking is also necessary to identify buildings presenting interesting energy saving potential An important issue in benchmarking is the use of performance indices to characterize the building These indexes can be Comfort indexes comparing the actual comfort conditions to the comfort requirements Energy indexes consisting in energy demands divided by heated conditioned area allowing comparison with reference values of the indexes coming from regulation or similar buildings Energy demands directly compared to reference energy demands generated by means of simulation tools Typically benchmarks are established based on the energy outlets loads within the building and are then further parsed into base loads and weather sensitive loads These are established through a simple regression analysis of energy consumption and demand if metered correlated to weather temperature and degree - day data during the period for which utility data is available Aggregate base loads will represent as the intercept of this regression and the slope will typically represent the combination of building envelope conduction and infiltration losses less losses or gains from the base loads themselves For example while lighting is typically a base load the heat generated from that lighting must be subtracted from the weather sensitive cooling load derived from the slope to gain an accurate picture of the true contribution of the building envelope on cooling energy use and demand Walk-through or preliminary audit edit The preliminary audit alternatively called a simple audit screening audit or walk-through audit is the simplest and quickest type of audit It involves minimal interviews with site-operating personnel a brief review of facility utility bills and other operating data and a walk-through of the facility to become familiar with the building operation and to identify any glaring areas of energy waste or inefficiency Typically only major problem areas will be covered during this type of audit Corrective measures are briefly described and quick estimates of implementation cost potential operating cost savings and simple payback periods are provided A list of energy conservation measures ECMs or energy conservation opportunities ECOs requiring further consideration is also provided This level of detail while not sufficient for reaching a final decision on implementing proposed measure is adequate to prioritize energy-efficiency projects and to determine the need for a more detailed audit General audit edit The general audit alternatively called a mini-audit site energy audit or detailed energy audit or complete site energy audit expands on the preliminary audit described above by collecting more detailed information about facility operation and by performing a more detailed evaluation of energy conservation measures Utility bills are collected for a - to -month period to allow the auditor to evaluate the facility s energy demand rate structures and energy usage profiles If interval meter data is available the detailed energy profiles that such data makes possible will typically be analyzed for signs of energy waste Additional metering of specific energy-consuming systems is often performed to supplement utility data In-depth interviews with facility operating personnel are conducted to provide a better understanding of major energy consuming systems and to gain insight into short- and longer-term energy consumption patterns This type of audit will be able to identify all energy-conservation measures appropriate for the facility given its operating parameters A detailed financial analysis is performed for each measure based on detailed implementation cost estimates site-specific operating cost savings and the customer s investment criteria Sufficient detail is provided to justify project implementation The evolution of cloud-based energy auditing software platforms is enabling the managers of commercial buildings to collaborate with general and specialty trades contractors in performing general and energy system-specific audits The benefit of software-enabled collaboration is the ability to identify the full range of energy efficiency options that may be applicable to the specific building under study with live time cost and benefit estimates supplied by local contractors Investment-grade audit edit In most corporate settings upgrades to a facility s energy infrastructure must compete for capital funding with non-energy-related investments Both energy and non-energy investments are rated on a single set of financial criteria that generally stress the expected return on investment ROI The projected operating savings from the implementation of energy projects must be developed such that they provide a high level of confidence In fact investors often demand guaranteed savings The investment-grade audit expands on the detailed audit described above and relies on a complete engineering study in order to detail technical and economical issues necessary to justify the investment related to the transformations Simulation-based energy audit procedure for non-residential buildings edit A complete audit procedure very similar to the ones proposed by ASHRAE and Krarti has been proposed in the frame of the AUDITAC and HARMONAC projects to help in the implementation of the EPB Energy Performance of Buildings directive in Europe and to fit to the current European market The following procedure proposes to make an intensive use of modern BES tools at each step of the audit process from benchmarking to detailed audit and financial study Benchmarking stage While normalization is required to allow comparison between data recorded on the studied installation and reference values deduced from case studies or statistics The use of simulation models to perform a code-compliant simulation of the installation under study allows to assess directly the studied installation without any normalization needed Indeed applying a simulation-based benchmarking tool allows an individual normalization and allows avoiding size and climate normalization Preliminary audit stage Global monthly consumptions are generally insufficient to allow an accurate understanding of the building s behaviour Even if the analysis of the energy bills does not allow identifying with accuracy the different energy consumers present in the facility the consumption records can be used to calibrate building and system simulation models To assess the existing system and to simulate correctly the building s thermal behaviour the simulation model has to be calibrated on the studied installation The iterations needed to perform the calibration of the model can also be fully integrated in the audit process and help in identifying required measurements and critical issues Detailed audit stage At this stage on-site measurements sub-metering and monitoring data are used to refine the calibration of the BES tool Extensive attention is given to understanding not only the operating characteristics of all energy consuming systems but also situations that cause load profile variations on short and longer term bases e g daily weekly monthly annual When the calibration criteria are satisfied the savings related to the selected ECOs ECMs can be quantified Investment-grade audit stage At this stage the results provided by the calibrated BES tool can be used to assess the selected ECOs ECMs and orient the detailed engineering study Specific audit techniques edit Infrared thermography audit edit The advent of high-resolution thermography has enabled inspectors to identify potential issues within the building envelope by taking a thermal image of the various surfaces of a building For purposes of an energy audit the thermographer will analyze the patterns within the surface temperatures to identify heat transfer through convection radiation or conduction It is important to note that the thermography only identifies surface temperatures and analysis must be applied to determine the reasons for the patterns within the surface temperatures Thermal analysis of a home generally costs between and dollars For those who cannot afford a thermal inspection it is possible to get a general feel for the heat loss with a non-contact infrared thermometer and several sheets of reflective insulation The method involves measuring the temperatures on the inside surfaces of several exterior walls to establish baseline temperatures After this reflective barrier insulation is taped securely to the walls in -foot m by -foot m strips and the temperatures are measured in the center of the insulated areas at -hour intervals for hours the reflective barrier is pulled away from the wall to measure the temperature in the center of the area which it has covered The best manner in which to do this is when the temperature differential Delta T between the inside and outside of the structure is at least degrees A well-insulated wall will commonly change approximately degree per hour if the difference between external and internal temperatures is an average of degrees A poorly insulated wall can drop as much as degrees in an hour Pollution audits edit With increases in carbon dioxide emissions or other greenhouse gases pollution audits are now a prominent factor in most energy audits Implementing energy efficient technologies help prevent utility generated pollution Online pollution and emission calculators can help approximate the emissions of other prominent air pollutants in addition to carbon dioxide Pollution audits generally take electricity and heating fuel consumption numbers over a two-year period and provide approximations for carbon dioxide VOCs nitrous oxides carbon monoxide sulfur dioxide mercury cadmium lead mercury compounds cadmium compounds and lead compounds History edit Energy audits initially became popular in response to the energy crisis of and later years Interest in energy audits has recently increased as a result of growing understanding of human impact upon global warming and climate change Energy audits are also popular due to financial incentives for

can enhance existing equipment by increasing operational energy efficiency at a lower cost As a comparison complete replacement of equipment may be more costly but can reduce the implementation complexity The overarching goal of energy efficiency implementation is to save kilowatt hours kWh is a measurement of energy actually consumed Public policy edit See also Renewable energy commercialization Public policy landscape Energy sector regulators can have wide discretion in the implementation and or monitoring energy efficiency EE initiatives The most likely roles involve giving technical advice to the agency developing EE initiatives since changes in demand patterns will have implications for the operations and investment plans of utilities Particularly when the EE outlays are by the utility the energy sector regulator needs to monitor outcomes to ensure that the resources are being used in ways that are consistent with overarching public policies Furthermore interactions of utility initiatives with other EE policies need to be taken into account when evaluating whether the scale and scope of existing utility-based demand-side management programs Utilities are in a position to analyze bills and conduct on-premises energy audits to identify areas of saving Regulators could require utilities to undertake costly audit programs A high tech approach to improving operations and the customer interface involves smart meters and information systems that enable the utility to track system performance in real time The costs of implementing such systems need to be balanced against the benefits including the possibility that outlays on other projects might be more cost-effective Thus the role of regulators primarily involves providing technical input into the development of EE policies initiated by other agencies or via legislated tax programs In addition the regulator must determine unless specified in law which benefit-cost test is appropriate for evaluating utility-based EE programs The regulatory tests include the participant cost test will participants benefit over the measure s life the program administrator cost test will utility bills increase the ratepayer impact measure will utility prices increase the total resource cost test will the total costs of energy decrease and the societal cost test is the utility state or nation better off including environmental impacts Effects edit See also Efficient energy use Aims Energy efficiency implementation can also play a role in increased revenue when environmentalist consumers choose a greener product over another that is not better source needed Energy efficiency implementation may need to be tailored to one s environmental needs For instance Christiann Abeelen s research on the energy efficiency projects in the Netherlands showed Our findings show that large differences exist in the realized savings between individual companies There is however no significant difference in savings observed between companies that participate in the Emission Trading System ETS and companies that do not Although it is impossible to disentangle the drivers behind the implementation of these projects the amount of savings suggest that at least part of them was implemented because of different energy policy instruments See also edit Jevons s paradox Efficient energy use References edit

when to remove this message Berner Tricoil Energy Recovery System atop the Center for Sustainable Landscapes in Pittsburgh Pennsylvania Energy recovery includes any technique or method of minimizing the input of energy to an overall system by the exchange of energy from one sub-system of the overall system with another The energy can be in any form in either subsystem but most energy recovery systems exchange thermal energy in either sensible or latent form In some circumstances the use of an enabling technology either daily thermal energy storage or seasonal thermal energy storage STES which allows heat or cold storage between opposing seasons is necessary to make energy recovery practicable One example is waste heat from air conditioning machinery stored in a buffer tank to aid in night time heating Principle edit A common application of this principle is in systems which have an exhaust stream or waste stream which is transferred from the system to its surroundings Some of the energy in that flow of material often gaseous or liquid may be transferred to the make-up or input material flow This input mass flow often comes from the system s surroundings which being at ambient conditions are at a lower temperature than the waste stream This temperature differential allows heat transfer and thus energy transfer or in this case recovery Thermal energy is often recovered from liquid or gaseous waste streams to fresh make-up air and water intakes in buildings such as for the HVAC systems or process systems System approach edit Energy consumption is a key part of most human activities This consumption involves converting one energy system to another for example The conversion of mechanical energy to electrical energy which can then power computers light motors etc The input energy propels the work and is mostly converted to heat or follows the product in the process as output energy Energy recovery systems harvest the output power and provide this as input power to the same or another process An energy recovery system will close this energy cycle to prevent the input power from being released back to nature and rather be used in other forms of desired work Examples edit Heat recovery is implemented in heat sources like e g a steel mill Heated cooling water from the process is sold for heating of homes shops and offices in the surrounding area Regenerative braking is used in electric cars trains heavy cranes etc where the energy consumed when elevating the potential is returned to the electric supplier when released Active pressure reduction systems where the differential pressure in a pressurized fluid flow is recovered rather than converted to heat in a pressure reduction valve and released Energy recovery ventilation Energy

Waste heat recovery units Electric Turbo Compound ETC edit Electric Turbo Compound ETC cross section Main article Electric turbo compound Electric Turbo Compounding ETC is a technology solution to the challenge of improving the fuel efficiency of gas and diesel engines by recovering waste energy from the exhaust gases STES edit At a foundry in Sweden waste heat is recovered and stored in a large mass of native bedrock which is penetrated by a cluster of heat exchanger equipped boreholes mm diameter that are m deep This store is used for heating an adjacent factory as needed even months later The Drake Landing Solar Community in Alberta Canada uses STES to recover and utilize natural heat that otherwise would be wasted The community uses a cluster of boreholes in bedrock for interseasonal heat storage and this enables obtaining percent of the year-round space heating from solar thermal collectors on the garage roofs Cold winter temperatures can be recovered by circulating water through a dry cooling tower and using that to chill a deep aquifer or borehole cluster The chill is later recovered from the storage for summer air conditioning With a coefficient of performance COP of to this method of cooling can be ten times more efficient than conventional air conditioning Environmental impact edit There is a large potential for energy recovery in compact systems like large industries and utilities Together with energy conservation it should be possible to dramatically reduce world energy consumption The effect of this will then be Reduced number of coal-fired power plants Reduced airborne particles NO x and CO improved air quality Slowing or reducing climate change Lower fuel bills on transport Longer availability of crude oil Change of industries and economies not fully researched In Tom Casten chairman of Recycled Energy Development said that We think we could make about to percent of U S electricity with heat that is currently thrown away by industry A Department of Energy study found the potential for megawatts of combined heat and power which uses energy recovery in the U S and a Lawrence Berkley National Laboratory study identified about megawatts that could be obtained from industrial waste energy not counting CHP These studies suggest that about megawatts or of total power capacity could come from energy recycling in the U S Widespread use of energy recycling could therefore reduce global warming emissions by an estimated percent Indeed as of about of U S greenhouse gas pollution came from the production of electricity and from the production of heat It is difficult to quantify the environmental impact of a global energy recovery implementation in some sectors The main impediments are citation needed Lack of efficient technologies for private homes Heat recovery systems in private homes can have an efficiency as low as or less It may be more realistic to use energy conservation like thermal insulation or improved buildings Many areas are more dependent on forced cooling and a system for extracting heat from dwellings to be used for other uses are not widely available Ineffective infrastructure Heat recovery in particular need a short distance from producer to consumer to be viable A solution may be to move a large consumer to the vicinity of the producer This may have other complications Transport sector is not ready With the transport sector using about of the energy supply most of the energy is spent on overcoming gravity and friction Electric cars with regenerative braking seem to be the best candidate for energy recovery Wind systems on ships are under development Very little work on the airline industry is known in this field See also edit Efficient energy use Energy

    "content": "Energy recycling - Wikipedia Jump to content From Wikipedia the free encyclopedia Process of using energy that would normally be wasted Energy recycling is the energy recovery process of using energy that would normally be wasted usually by converting it into electricity or thermal energy Undertaken at manufacturing facilities power plants and large institutions such as hospitals and universities it significantly increases efficiency thereby reducing energy costs and greenhouse gas pollution simultaneously The process is noted for its potential to mitigate global warming profitably This work is usually done in the form of combined heat and power also called cogeneration or waste heat recovery Forms of energy recycling edit Waste heat recovery edit Waste heat recovery is a process that captures excess heat that would normally be discharged at manufacturing facilities and converts it into electricity and steam or returns energy to the manufacturing process in the form of heated air water glycol or oil A waste heat recovery boiler contains a series of water-filled tubes placed throughout the area where heat is released When high-temperature heat meets the boiler steam is produced which in turn powers a turbine that creates electricity This process is similar to that of other fired boilers but in this case waste heat replaces a traditional flame No fossil fuels are used in this process Metals glass pulp and paper silicon and other production plants are typical locations where waste heat recovery can be effective See also Organic Rankine cycle Combined heat and power CHP edit Combined heat and power CHP also called cogeneration is according to the U S Environmental Protection Agency an efficient clean and reliable approach to generating electricity and heat energy from a single fuel source By installing a CHP system designed to meet the thermal and electrical base loads of a facility CHP can greatly increase the facility s operational efficiency and decrease energy costs At the same time CHP reduces the emission of greenhouse gases which contribute to global climate change When electricity is produced on-site with a CHP plant excess heat is recycled to produce both processed heat and additional power Waste heat recovery from air conditioning edit Waste heat recovery from air conditioning is also used as an alternative to wasting heat to the atmosphere from chiller plants Heat recovered in summer from chiller plants is stored in Thermalbanks in the ground and recycled back to the same building in winter via a heat pump to provide heating without burning fossil fuels This elegant approach saves energy - and carbon - in both seasons by recycling summer heat for winter use Some companies offer products to install on the HVAC Condenser Unit to collect waste heat that the condenser is supposed to evacuate in the air to heat up heat-producing devices like water heaters Those devices are called heat recovery units HRU For residential applications some units available are HotSpot Energy Heat Recovery Unit or LG Heat Recovery Units For industrial applications these units are usually called waste heat recovery unit WHRU Heat pumps edit Heat pumps and thermal energy storage are classes of technologies that can enable the recycling of energy that would otherwise be inaccessible due to a temperature that is too low for use or a time lag between when the energy is available and when it is needed While enhancing the temperature of available renewable thermal energy heat pumps have the additional property of leveraging electrical power or in some cases mechanical or thermal power by using it to extract additional energy from a low quality source such as seawater lake water the ground the air or waste heat from a process Innovation efforts are underway now for full electrification of industry including with Industry Heat Pumps at levels of efficiency between COP using multi-stage thermal recycling via refrigerant tuned Heat Pump Modules Thermal storage edit Thermal storage technologies allow heat or cold to be stored for periods of time ranging from hours or overnight to interseasonal and can involve storage of sensible energy i e by changing the temperature of a medium or latent energy i e through phase changes of a medium such between water and slush or ice Short-term thermal storages can be used for peak-shaving in district heating or electrical distribution systems Kinds of renewable or alternative energy sources that can be enabled include natural energy e g collected via solar-thermal collectors or dry cooling towers used to collect winter s cold waste energy e g from HVAC equipment industrial processes or power plants or surplus energy e g as seasonally from hydropower projects or intermittently from wind farms The Drake Landing Solar Community Alberta Canada is illustrative Borehole thermal energy storage allows the community to get of its year-round heat from solar collectors on the garage roofs with most of the heat collected in summer Types of storages for sensible energy include insulated tanks borehole clusters in substrates ranging from gravel to bedrock deep aquifers or shallow lined pits that are insulated on top Some types of storage are capable of storing heat or cold between opposing seasons particularly if very large and some storage applications require inclusion of a heat pump Latent heat is typically stored in ice tanks or what are called phase-change materials PCMs Current system edit Both waste heat recovery and CHP constitute decentralized energy production which is in contrast to traditional centralized power generated at large power plants run by regional utilities The centralized system has an average efficiency of percent requiring about three units of fuel to produce one unit of power By capturing both heat and power CHP and waste heat recovery projects have higher efficiencies A Department of Energy study found the potential for megawatts of CHP in the U S and a Lawrence Berkley National Laboratory study identified about megawatts that could be obtained from industrial waste energy not counting CHP These studies suggest about megawatts or -- of total power capacity that could come from energy recycling in the U S Widespread use of energy recycling could therefore reduce global warming emissions by an estimated percent Indeed as of about percent of U S greenhouse gas pollution came from the production of electricity and percent from the production of heat Advocates contend that recycled energy costs less and has lower emissions than most other energy options in current use Currently RecyclingEnergy Int Corp takes advantage of recycling energy in heat recovery ventilation and latent heat pump and CHCP History edit Perhaps the first modern use of energy recycling was done by Thomas Edison His Pearl Street Station the world s first commercial power plant was a CHP plant producing both electricity and thermal energy while using waste heat to warm neighboring buildings Recycling allowed Edison s plant to achieve approximately percent efficiency By the early s regulations emerged to promote rural electrification through the construction of centralized plants managed by regional utilities These regulations not only promoted electrification throughout the countryside but they also discouraged decentralized power generation such as CHP They even went so far as to make it illegal for non-utilities to sell power By Congress recognized that efficiency at central power plants had stagnated and sought to encourage improved efficiency with the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act PURPA which encouraged utilities to buy power from other energy producers CHP plants proliferated soon producing about percent of all energy in the U S However the bill left implementation and enforcement up to individual states resulting in little or nothing being done in many parts of the country In Tom Casten chairman of Recycled Energy Development said that We think we could make about to percent of U S electricity with heat that is currently thrown away by industry Outside the U S energy recycling is more common Denmark is probably the most active energy recycler obtaining about of its energy from CHP and waste heat recovery Other large countries including Germany Russia and India also obtain a much higher share of their energy from decentralized sources See also edit Energy conservation Reducing energy consumption Renewable energy Energy collected from

Watercraft Personal transporter Rail transport Tram Rapid transit Personal rapid transit Category Renewable energy portal v t e Energy storage is the capture of energy produced at one time for use at a later time to reduce imbalances between energy demand and energy production A device that stores energy is generally called an accumulator or battery Energy comes in multiple forms including radiation chemical gravitational potential electrical potential electricity elevated temperature latent heat and kinetic Energy storage involves converting energy from forms that are difficult to store to more conveniently or economically storable forms Some technologies provide short-term energy storage while others can endure for much longer Bulk energy storage is currently dominated by hydroelectric dams both conventional as well as pumped Grid energy storage is a collection of methods used for energy storage on a large scale within an electrical power grid Common examples of energy storage are the rechargeable battery which stores chemical energy readily convertible to electricity to operate a mobile phone the hydroelectric dam which stores energy in a reservoir as gravitational potential energy and ice storage tanks which store ice frozen by cheaper energy at night to meet peak daytime demand for cooling Fossil fuels such as coal and gasoline store ancient energy derived from sunlight by organisms that later died became buried and over time were then converted into these fuels Food which is made by the same process as fossil fuels is a form of energy stored in chemical form History edit In the th century grid electrical power was largely generated by burning fossil fuel When less power was required less fuel was burned Hydropower a mechanical energy storage method is the most widely adopted mechanical energy storage and has been in use for centuries Large hydropower dams have been energy storage sites for more than one hundred years Concerns with air pollution energy imports and global warming have spawned the growth of renewable energy such as solar and wind power Wind power is uncontrolled and may be generating at a time when no additional power is needed Solar power varies with cloud cover and at best is only available during daylight hours while demand often peaks after sunset see duck curve Interest in storing power from these intermittent sources grows as the renewable energy industry begins to generate a larger fraction of overall energy consumption In BloombergNEF forecast total energy storage deployments to grow at a compound annual growth rate of percent through Off grid electrical use was a niche market in the th century but in the st century it has expanded Portable devices are in use all over the world Solar panels are now common in the rural settings worldwide Access to electricity is now a question of economics and financial viability and not solely on technical aspects Electric vehicles are gradually replacing combustion-engine vehicles However powering long-distance transportation without burning fuel remains in development Methods edit Comparison of various energy storage technologies Outline edit The

Phase-change material Seasonal thermal energy storage Solar pond Steam accumulator Thermal energy storage general Chemical Biofuels Hydrated salts Hydrogen peroxide Power-to-gas methane hydrogen storage oxyhydrogen Power-to-solid metal energy carriers sulfur Mechanical edit Energy from sunlight or other renewable sources is converted to potential energy for storage in devices such as electric batteries The stored potential energy is later converted to electricity that is added to the power grid even when the original energy source is not available In pumped hydro systems energy from the source is used to lift water upward against the force of gravity giving it potential energy that is later converted to electricity provided to the power grid Energy can be stored in water pumped to a higher elevation using pumped storage methods or by moving solid matter to higher locations gravity batteries Other commercial mechanical methods include compressing air and flywheels that convert electric energy into internal energy or kinetic energy and then back again when electrical demand peaks Hydroelectricity edit Main article Hydroelectricity Hydroelectric dams with reservoirs can be operated to provide electricity at times of peak demand Water is stored in the reservoir during periods of low demand and released when demand is high The net effect is similar to pumped storage but without the pumping loss While a hydroelectric dam does not directly store energy from other generating units it behaves equivalently by lowering output in periods of excess electricity from other sources In this mode dams are one of the most efficient forms of energy storage because only the timing of its generation changes Hydroelectric turbines have a start-up time on the order of a few minutes Pumped hydro edit The Sir Adam Beck Generating Complex at Niagara Falls Canada which includes a large pumped storage hydroelectricity reservoir to provide an extra MW of electricity during periods of peak demand Main article Pumped-storage hydroelectricity Worldwide pumped-storage hydroelectricity PSH is the largest-capacity form of active grid energy storage available and as of March the Electric Power Research Institute EPRI reports that PSH accounts for more than of bulk storage capacity worldwide representing around MW PSH energy efficiency varies in practice between and with claims of up to At times of low electrical demand excess generation capacity is used to pump water from a lower source into a higher reservoir When demand grows water is released back into a lower reservoir or waterway or body of water through a turbine generating electricity Reversible turbine-generator assemblies act as both a pump and turbine usually a Francis turbine design Nearly all facilities use the height difference between two water bodies Pure pumped-storage plants shift the water between reservoirs while the pump-back approach is a combination of pumped storage and conventional hydroelectric plants that use natural stream-flow Compressed air edit A compressed air locomotive used inside a mine between and Main articles Compressed air energy storage and Salt dome Compressed-air energy storage CAES uses surplus energy to compress air for subsequent electricity generation Small-scale systems have long been used in such applications as propulsion of mine locomotives The compressed air is stored in an underground reservoir such as a salt dome Compressed-air energy storage CAES plants can bridge the gap between production volatility and load CAES storage addresses the energy needs of consumers by effectively providing readily available energy to meet demand Renewable energy sources like wind and solar energy vary So at times when they provide little power they need to be supplemented with other forms of energy to meet energy demand Compressed-air energy storage plants can take in the surplus energy output of renewable energy sources during times of energy over-production This stored energy can be used at a later time when demand for electricity increases or energy resource availability decreases Compression of air creates heat the air is warmer after compression Expansion requires heat If no extra heat is added the air will be much colder after expansion If the heat generated during compression can be stored and used during expansion efficiency improves considerably A CAES system can deal with the heat in three ways Air storage can be adiabatic diabatic or isothermal Another approach uses compressed air to power vehicles Flywheel edit The main components of a typical flywheel A Flybrid Kinetic Energy Recovery System flywheel Built for use on Formula racing cars it is employed to recover and reuse kinetic energy captured during braking Main articles Flywheel energy storage and Flywheel storage power system Flywheel energy storage FES works by accelerating a rotor a flywheel to a very high speed holding energy as rotational energy When energy is added the rotational speed of the flywheel increases and when energy is extracted the speed declines due to conservation of energy Most FES systems use electricity to accelerate and decelerate the flywheel but devices that directly use mechanical energy are under consideration FES systems have rotors made of high strength carbon-fiber composites suspended by magnetic bearings and spinning at speeds from to over revolutions per minute rpm in a vacuum enclosure Such flywheels can reach maximum speed charge in a matter of minutes The flywheel system is connected to a combination electric motor generator FES systems have relatively long lifetimes lasting decades with little or no maintenance full-cycle lifetimes quoted for flywheels range from in excess of up to cycles of use high specific energy W h kg or kJ kg and power density Solid mass gravitational edit Main article Gravity battery Changing the altitude of solid masses can store or release energy via an elevating system driven by an electric motor generator Studies suggest energy can begin to be released with as little as second warning making the method a useful supplemental feed into an electricity grid to balance load surges Efficiencies can be as high as recovery of stored energy This can be achieved by siting the masses inside old vertical mine shafts or in specially constructed towers where the heavy weights are winched up to store energy and allowed a controlled descent to release it At a prototype vertical store is being built in Edinburgh Scotland Potential energy storage or gravity energy storage was under active development in in association with the California Independent System Operator It examined the movement of earth-filled hopper rail cars driven by electric locomotives from lower to higher elevations Other proposed methods include using rails cranes or elevators to move weights up and down using high-altitude solar-powered balloon platforms supporting winches to raise and lower solid masses slung underneath them using winches supported by an ocean barge to take advantage of a km ft elevation difference between the sea surface and the seabed District heating accumulation tower from Theiss near Krems an der Donau in Lower Austria with a thermal capacity of GWh Thermal edit Main articles Thermal energy storage Molten salt and Seasonal thermal energy storage Thermal energy storage TES is the temporary storage or removal of heat Sensible heat thermal edit Sensible heat storage take advantage of sensible heat in a material to store energy Seasonal thermal energy storage STES allows heat or cold to be used months after it was collected from waste energy or natural sources The material can be stored in contained aquifers clusters of boreholes in geological substrates such as sand or crystalline bedrock in lined pits filled with gravel and water or water-filled mines Seasonal thermal energy storage STES projects often have paybacks in four to six years An example is Drake Landing Solar Community in Canada for which of the year-round heat is provided by solar-thermal collectors on garage roofs enabled by a borehole thermal energy store BTES In Braedstrup Denmark the community s solar district heating system also uses STES at a temperature of C F A heat pump which runs only while surplus wind power is available It is used to raise the temperature to C F for distribution When wind energy is not available a gas-fired boiler is used Twenty percent of Braedstrup s heat is solar Latent heat thermal LHTES edit Latent heat thermal energy storage systems work by transferring heat to or from a material to change its phase A phase-change is the melting solidifying vaporizing or liquifying Such a material is called a phase change material PCM Materials used in LHTESs often have a high latent heat so that at their specific temperature the phase change absorbs a large amount of energy much more than sensible heat A steam accumulator is a type of LHTES where the phase change is between liquid and gas and uses the latent heat of vaporization of water Ice storage air conditioning systems use off-peak electricity to store cold by freezing water into ice The stored cold in ice releases during melting process and can be used for cooling at peak hours Cryogenic thermal energy storage edit Main article Cryogenic energy storage Air can be liquefied by cooling using electricity and stored as a cryogen with existing technologies The liquid air can then be expanded through a turbine and the energy recovered as electricity The system was demonstrated at a pilot plant in the UK in In Highview announced plans to build a MW in the North of England and northern Vermont with the proposed facility able to store five to eight hours of energy for a MWh storage capacity Carnot battery edit Main article Carnot battery Electrical energy can be stored thermally by resistive heating or heat pumps and the stored heat can be converted back to electricity via Rankine cycle or Brayton cycle This technology has been studied to retrofit coal-fired power plants into fossil-fuel free generation systems Coal-fired boilers are replaced by high-temperature heat storage charged by excess electricity from renewable energy sources In German Aerospace Center started to construct the world s first large-scale Carnot battery system which has MWh storage capacity Electrochemical edit Rechargeable battery edit A rechargeable battery bank used as an uninterruptible power supply in a data center Main articles Rechargeable battery and Battery storage power station A rechargeable battery comprises one or more electrochemical cells It is known as a secondary cell because its electrochemical reactions are electrically reversible Rechargeable batteries come in many shapes and sizes ranging from button cells to megawatt grid systems Rechargeable batteries have lower total cost of use and environmental impact than non-rechargeable disposable batteries Some rechargeable battery types are available in the same form factors as disposables Rechargeable batteries have higher initial cost but can be recharged very cheaply and used many times Common rechargeable battery chemistries include Lead acid battery Lead acid batteries hold the largest market share of electric storage products A single cell produces about V when charged In the charged state the metallic lead negative electrode and the lead sulfate positive electrode are immersed in a dilute sulfuric acid H SO electrolyte In the discharge process electrons are pushed out of the cell as lead sulfate is formed at the negative electrode while the electrolyte is reduced to water Lead acid battery technology has been developed extensively Upkeep requires minimal labor and its cost is low The battery s available energy capacity is subject to a quick discharge resulting in a low life span and low energy density Nickel cadmium battery NiCd Uses nickel oxide hydroxide and metallic cadmium as electrodes Cadmium is a toxic element and was banned for most uses by the European Union in Nickel cadmium batteries have been almost completely replaced by nickel metal hydride NiMH batteries Nickel metal hydride battery NiMH First commercial types were available in These are now a common consumer and industrial type The battery has a hydrogen-absorbing alloy for the negative electrode instead of cadmium Lithium-ion battery The choice in many consumer electronics and have one of the best energy-to-mass ratios and a very slow self-discharge when not in use Lithium-ion polymer battery These batteries are light in weight and can be made in any shape desired Aluminium - sulfur battery with rock salt crystals as electrolyte aluminium and sulfur are Earth-abundant materials and are much cheaper than traditional lithium Flow battery edit Main articles Flow battery and Vanadium redox battery A flow battery works by passing a solution over a membrane where ions are exchanged to charge or discharge the cell Cell voltage is chemically determined by the Nernst equation and ranges in practical applications from V to V Storage capacity depends on the volume of solution A flow battery is technically akin both to a fuel cell and an electrochemical accumulator cell Commercial applications are for long half-cycle storage such as backup grid power Supercapacitor edit One of a fleet of electric capabuses powered by supercapacitors at a quick-charge station-bus stop in service during Expo Shanghai China Charging rails can be seen suspended over the bus Main article Supercapacitor Supercapacitors also called electric double-layer capacitors EDLC or ultracapacitors are a family of electrochemical capacitors that do not have conventional solid dielectrics Capacitance is determined by two storage principles double-layer capacitance and pseudocapacitance Supercapacitors bridge the gap between conventional capacitors and rechargeable batteries They store the most energy per unit volume or mass energy density among capacitors They support up to farads Volt up to times that of electrolytic capacitors but deliver or accept less than half as much power per unit time power density While supercapacitors have specific energy and energy densities that are approximately of batteries their power density is generally to times greater This results in much shorter charge discharge cycles Also they tolerate many more charge-discharge cycles than batteries Supercapacitors have many applications including Low supply current for memory backup in static random-access memory SRAM Power for cars buses trains cranes and elevators including energy recovery from braking short-term energy storage and burst-mode power delivery Chemical edit Power-to-gas edit The new technology helps reduce greenhouse gases and operating costs at two existing peaker plants in Norwalk and Rancho Cucamonga The -megawatt battery storage system combined with the gas turbine allows the peaker plant to more quickly respond to changing energy needs thus increasing the reliability of the electrical grid Main article Power-to-gas Power-to-gas is the conversion of electricity to a gaseous fuel such as hydrogen or methane The three commercial methods use electricity to reduce water into hydrogen and oxygen by means of electrolysis In the first method hydrogen is injected into the natural gas grid or is used for transportation The second method is to combine the hydrogen with carbon dioxide to produce methane using a methanation reaction such as the Sabatier reaction or biological methanation resulting in an extra energy conversion loss of The methane may then be fed into the natural gas grid The third method uses the output gas of a wood gas generator or a biogas plant after the biogas upgrader is mixed with the hydrogen from the electrolyzer to upgrade the quality of the biogas Hydrogen edit Main article Hydrogen storage See also Combined cycle hydrogen power plant and Hydrogen fuel cell power plant The element hydrogen can be a form of stored energy Hydrogen can produce electricity via a hydrogen fuel cell At penetrations below of the grid demand renewables do not severely change the economics but beyond about of the total demand external storage becomes important If these sources are used to make ionic hydrogen they can be freely expanded A -year community-based pilot program using wind turbines and hydrogen generators began in in the remote community of Ramea Newfoundland and Labrador A similar project began in on Utsira a small Norwegian island Energy losses involved in the hydrogen storage cycle come from the electrolysis of water liquification or compression of the hydrogen and conversion to electricity Hydrogen can also be produced from aluminum and water by stripping aluminum s naturally occurring aluminum oxide barrier and introducing it to water This method is beneficial because recycled aluminum cans can be used to generate hydrogen however systems to harness this option have not been commercially developed and are much more complex than electrolysis systems Common methods to strip the oxide layer include caustic catalysts such as sodium hydroxide and alloys with gallium mercury and other metals Underground hydrogen storage is the practice of hydrogen storage in caverns salt domes and depleted oil and gas fields Large quantities of gaseous hydrogen have been stored in caverns by Imperial Chemical Industries for many years without any difficulties The European Hyunder project indicated in that storage of wind and solar energy using underground hydrogen would require caverns Powerpaste is a magnesium and hydrogen -based fluid gel that releases hydrogen when reacting with water It was invented patented and is being developed by the Fraunhofer Institute for Manufacturing Technology and Advanced Materials IFAM of the Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft Powerpaste is made by combining magnesium powder with hydrogen to form magnesium hydride in a process conducted at C and five to six times atmospheric pressure An ester and a metal salt are then added to make the finished product Fraunhofer states that they are building a production plant slated to start production in which will produce tons of Powerpaste annually Fraunhofer has patented their invention in the

is then reacted with carbon dioxide in a Sabatier process producing methane and water Methane can be stored and later used to produce electricity The resulting water is recycled reducing the need for water In the electrolysis stage oxygen is stored for methane combustion in a pure oxygen environment at an adjacent power plant eliminating nitrogen oxides Methane combustion produces carbon dioxide CO and water The carbon dioxide can be recycled to boost the Sabatier process and water can be recycled for further electrolysis Methane production storage and combustion recycles the reaction products The CO has economic value as a component of an energy storage vector not a cost as in carbon capture and storage Power-to-liquid edit Power-to-liquid is similar to power to gas except that the hydrogen is converted into liquids such as methanol or ammonia These are easier to handle than gases and require fewer safety precautions than hydrogen They can be used for transportation including aircraft but also for industrial purposes or in the power sector Biofuels edit Main article Biofuel Various biofuels such as biodiesel vegetable oil alcohol fuels or biomass can replace fossil fuels Various chemical processes can convert the carbon and hydrogen in coal natural gas plant and animal biomass and organic wastes into short hydrocarbons suitable as replacements for existing hydrocarbon fuels Examples are Fischer Tropsch diesel methanol dimethyl ether and syngas This diesel source was used extensively in World War II in Germany which faced limited access to crude oil supplies South Africa produces most of the country s diesel from coal for similar reasons A long term oil price above US bbl may make such large scale synthetic liquid fuels economical Power-to-Solid edit Similar to power-to-liquid and power-to-gas concepts energy may be stored in solid materials for example in metals such as iron aluminium and non-metallic materials such as sulfur Energy in the form of electricity or solar heat is stored chemically and can be released on-demand Historically solid energy carriers have been long used in fireworks and rockets Aluminum edit Aluminum has been proposed as an energy store by a number of researchers Its electrochemical equivalent Ah cm is nearly four times greater than that of lithium Ah cm Energy can be extracted from aluminum by reacting it with water to generate hydrogen However it must first be stripped of its natural oxide layer a process which requires pulverization chemical reactions with caustic substances or alloys The byproduct of the reaction to create hydrogen is aluminum oxide which can be recycled into aluminum with the Hall H roult process making the reaction theoretically renewable If the Hall-H roult Process is run using solar or wind power aluminum could be used to store the energy produced at higher efficiency than direct solar electrolysis Boron silicon and zinc edit Boron silicon and zinc have been proposed as energy storage solutions Other chemical edit The organic compound norbornadiene converts to quadricyclane upon exposure to light storing solar energy as the energy of chemical bonds A working system has been developed in Sweden as a molecular solar thermal system Electrical methods edit Capacitor edit Main article capacitor This mylar-film oil-filled capacitor has very low inductance and low resistance to provide the high-power megawatts and the very high speed microsecond discharges needed to operate a dye laser A capacitor originally known as a condenser is a passive two-terminal electrical component used to store energy electrostatically Practical capacitors vary widely but all contain at least two electrical conductors plates separated by a dielectric i e insulator A capacitor can store electric energy when disconnected from its charging circuit so it can be used like a temporary battery or like other types of rechargeable energy storage system Capacitors are commonly used in electronic devices to maintain power supply while batteries change This prevents loss of information in volatile memory Conventional capacitors provide less than joules per kilogram while a conventional alkaline battery has a density of kJ kg Capacitors store energy in an electrostatic field between their plates Given a potential difference across the conductors e g when a capacitor is attached across a battery an electric field develops across the dielectric causing positive charge Q to collect on one plate and negative charge -Q to collect on the other plate If a battery is attached to a capacitor for a sufficient amount of time no current can flow through the capacitor However if an accelerating or alternating voltage is applied across the leads of the capacitor a displacement current can flow Besides capacitor plates charge can also be stored in a dielectric layer Capacitance is greater given a narrower separation between conductors and when the conductors have a larger surface area In practice the dielectric between the plates emits a small amount of leakage current and has an electric field strength limit known as the breakdown voltage However the effect of recovery of a dielectric after a high-voltage breakdown holds promise for a new generation of self-healing capacitors The conductors and leads introduce undesired inductance and resistance Research is assessing the quantum effects of nanoscale capacitors for digital quantum batteries Superconducting magnetics edit Main article Superconducting magnetic energy storage Superconducting magnetic energy storage SMES systems store energy in a magnetic field created by the flow of direct current in a superconducting coil that has been cooled to a temperature below its superconducting critical temperature A typical SMES system includes a superconducting coil power conditioning system and refrigerator Once the superconducting coil is charged the current does not decay and the magnetic energy can be stored indefinitely The stored energy can be released to the network by discharging the coil The associated inverter rectifier accounts for about energy loss in each direction SMES loses the least amount of electricity in the energy storage process compared to other methods of storing energy SMES systems offer round-trip efficiency greater than Due to the energy requirements of refrigeration and the cost of superconducting wire SMES is used for short duration storage such as improving power quality It also has applications in grid balancing Applications edit Mills edit The classic application before the Industrial Revolution was the control of waterways to drive water mills for processing grain or powering machinery Complex systems of reservoirs and dams were constructed to store and release water and the potential energy it contained when required Homes edit Main article Home energy storage Home energy storage is expected to become increasingly common given the growing importance of distributed generation of renewable energies especially photovoltaics and the important share of energy consumption in buildings To exceed a self-sufficiency of in a household equipped with photovoltaics energy storage is needed Multiple manufacturers produce rechargeable battery systems for storing energy generally to hold surplus energy from home solar or wind generation Today for home energy storage Li-ion batteries are preferable to lead-acid ones given their similar cost but much better performance Tesla Motors produces two models of the Tesla Powerwall One is a kWh weekly cycle version for backup applications and the other is a kWh version for daily cycle applications In a limited version of the Tesla Powerpack cost US kWh to store electricity worth cents kWh US average grid price making a positive return on investment doubtful unless electricity prices are higher than cents kWh RoseWater Energy produces two models of the Energy Storage System the HUB and SB Both versions provide kWh of output enabling it to run larger houses or light commercial premises and protecting custom installations The system provides five key elements into one system including providing a clean Hz Sine wave zero transfer time industrial-grade surge protection renewable energy grid sell-back optional and battery backup Enphase Energy announced an integrated system that allows home users to store monitor and manage electricity The system stores kWh of energy and W W power output Storing wind or solar energy using thermal energy storage though less flexible is considerably cheaper than batteries A simple -gallon electric water heater can store roughly kWh of energy for supplementing hot water or space heating For purely financial purposes in areas where net metering is available home generated electricity may be sold to the grid through a grid-tie inverter without the use of batteries for storage Grid electricity and power stations edit Main articles Grid energy storage and Battery storage power station Renewable energy edit Construction of the Salt Tanks which provide efficient thermal energy storage so that electricity can be generated after the sun goes down and output can be scheduled to meet demand The MW Solana Generating Station is designed to provide six hours of storage This allows the plant to generate about of its rated capacity over the course of a year The MW Andasol solar power station in Spain is a parabolic trough solar thermal power plant that stores energy in tanks of molten salt so that it can continue generating electricity when the sun is not shining The largest source and the greatest store of renewable energy is provided by hydroelectric dams A large reservoir behind a dam can store enough water to average the annual flow of a river between dry and wet seasons and a very large reservoir can store enough water to average the flow of a river between dry and wet years While a hydroelectric dam does not directly store energy from intermittent sources it does balance the grid by lowering its output and retaining its water when power is generated by solar or wind If wind or solar generation exceeds the region s hydroelectric capacity then some additional source of energy is needed Many renewable energy sources notably solar and wind produce variable power Storage systems can level out the imbalances between supply and demand that this causes Electricity must be used as it is generated or converted immediately into storable forms The main method of electrical grid storage is pumped-storage hydroelectricity Areas of the world such as Norway Wales Japan and the US have used elevated geographic features for reservoirs using electrically powered pumps to fill them When needed the water passes through generators and converts the gravitational potential of the falling water into electricity Pumped storage in Norway which gets almost all its electricity from hydro has currently a capacity of GW but since the total installed capacity is nearly GW and of that is regulable it can be expanded significantly Some forms of storage that produce electricity include pumped-storage hydroelectric dams rechargeable batteries thermal storage including molten salts which can efficiently store and release very large quantities of heat energy and compressed air energy storage flywheels cryogenic systems and superconducting magnetic coils Surplus power can also be converted into methane Sabatier process with stockage in the natural gas network In the Bonneville Power Administration in the northwestern United States created an experimental program to absorb excess wind and hydro power generated at night or during stormy periods that are accompanied by high winds Under central control home appliances absorb surplus energy by heating ceramic bricks in special space heaters to hundreds of degrees and by boosting the temperature of modified hot water heater tanks After charging the appliances provide home heating and hot water as needed The experimental system was created as a result of a severe storm that overproduced renewable energy to the extent that all conventional power sources were shut down or in the case of a nuclear power plant reduced to its lowest possible operating level leaving a large area running almost completely on renewable energy Another advanced method used at the former Solar Two project in the United States and the Solar Tres Power Tower in Spain uses molten salt to store thermal energy captured from the sun and then convert it and dispatch it as electrical power The system pumps molten salt through a tower or other special conduits to be heated by the sun Insulated tanks store the solution Electricity is produced by turning water to steam that is fed to turbines Since the early st century batteries have been applied to utility scale load-leveling and frequency regulation capabilities In vehicle-to-grid storage electric vehicles that are plugged into the energy grid can deliver stored electrical energy from their batteries into the grid when needed Air conditioning edit Main article Ice storage air conditioning Thermal energy storage TES can be used for air conditioning It is most widely used for cooling single large buildings and or groups of smaller buildings Commercial air conditioning systems are the biggest contributors to peak electrical loads In thermal storage was used in over buildings in over countries It works by chilling material at night and using the chilled material for cooling during the hotter daytime periods The most popular technique is ice storage which requires less space than water and is cheaper than fuel cells or flywheels In this application a standard chiller runs at night to produce an ice pile Water circulates through the pile during the day to chill water that would normally be the chiller s daytime output A partial storage system minimizes capital investment by running the chillers nearly hours a day At night they produce ice for storage and during the day they chill water Water circulating through the melting ice augments the production of chilled water Such a system makes ice for to hours a day and melts ice for six hours a day Capital expenditures are reduced because the chillers can be just of the size needed for a conventional no-storage design Storage sufficient to store half a day s available heat is usually adequate A full storage system shuts off the chillers during peak load hours Capital costs are higher as such a system requires larger chillers and a larger ice storage system This ice is produced when electrical utility rates are lower Off-peak cooling systems can lower energy costs The U S Green Building Council has developed the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design LEED program to encourage the design of reduced-environmental impact buildings Off-peak cooling may help toward LEED Certification Thermal storage for heating is less common than for cooling An example of thermal storage is storing solar heat to be used for heating at night Latent heat can also be stored in technical phase change materials PCMs These can be encapsulated in wall and ceiling panels to moderate room temperatures Transport edit Liquid hydrocarbon fuels are the most commonly used forms of energy storage for use in transportation followed by a growing use of Battery Electric Vehicles and Hybrid Electric Vehicles Other energy carriers such as hydrogen can be used to avoid producing greenhouse gases Public transport systems like trams and trolleybuses require electricity but due to their variability in movement a steady supply of electricity via renewable energy is challenging Photovoltaic systems installed on the roofs of buildings can be used to power public transportation systems during periods in which there is increased demand for electricity and access to other forms of energy are not readily available Upcoming transitions in the transportation system also include e g ferries and airplanes where electric power supply is investigated as an interesting alternative Electronics edit Capacitors are widely used in electronic circuits for blocking direct current while allowing alternating current to pass In analog filter networks they smooth the output of power supplies In resonant circuits they tune radios to particular frequencies In electric power transmission systems they stabilize voltage and power flow Use cases edit Main article United States Department of Energy International Energy Storage Database The United States Department of Energy International Energy Storage Database IESDB is a free-access database of energy storage projects and policies funded by the United States Department of Energy Office of Electricity and Sandia National Labs Capacity edit Storage capacity is the amount of energy extracted from an energy storage device or system usually measured in joules or kilowatt-hours and their multiples it may be given in number of hours of electricity production at power plant nameplate capacity when storage is of primary type i e thermal or pumped-water output is sourced only with the power plant embedded storage system Economics edit The economics of energy storage strictly depends on the reserve service requested and several uncertainty factors affect the profitability of energy storage Therefore not every storage method is technically and economically suitable for the storage of several MWh and the optimal size of the energy storage is market and location dependent Moreover ESS are affected by several risks e g Techno-economic risks which are related to the specific technology Market risks which are the factors that affect the electricity supply system Regulation and policy risks Therefore traditional techniques based on deterministic Discounted Cash Flow DCF for the investment appraisal are not fully adequate to evaluate these risks and uncertainties and the investor s flexibility to deal with them Hence the literature recommends to assess the value of risks and uncertainties through the Real Option Analysis ROA which is a valuable method in uncertain contexts The economic valuation of large-scale applications including pumped hydro storage and compressed air considers benefits including curtailment avoidance grid congestion avoidance price arbitrage and carbon-free energy delivery In one technical assessment by the Carnegie Mellon Electricity Industry Centre economic goals could be met using batteries if their capital cost was to per kilowatt-hour A metric of energy efficiency of storage is energy storage on energy invested ESOI which is the amount of energy that can be stored by a technology divided by the amount of energy required to build that technology The higher the ESOI the better the storage technology is energetically For lithium-ion batteries this is around and for lead acid batteries it is about Other forms of storage such as pumped hydroelectric storage generally have higher ESOI such as Pumped-storage hydroelectricity is by far the largest storage technology used globally However the usage of conventional pumped-hydro storage is limited because it requires terrain with elevation differences and also has a very high land use for relatively small power In locations without suitable natural geography underground pumped-hydro storage could also be used High costs and limited life still make batteries a weak substitute for dispatchable power sources and are unable to cover for variable renewable power gaps lasting for days weeks or months In grid models with high VRE share the excessive cost of storage tends to dominate the costs of the whole grid for example in California alone share of VRE would require TWh of storage but would require TWh As of the state only had GWh of storage primarily in pumped storage and a small fraction in batteries According to another study supplying of US demand from VRE would require a smart grid covering the whole country or battery storage capable to supply the whole system for hours both at cost estimated at trillion Similarly several studies have found that relying only on VRE and energy storage would cost about more than a comparable system that combines VRE with nuclear plants or plants with carbon capture and storage instead of energy storage Research edit Germany edit In the German government allocated M approximately US M for research and another M to subsidize battery storage in residential rooftop solar panels according to a representative of the German Energy Storage Association Siemens AG commissioned a production-research plant to open in at the Zentrum f r Sonnenenergie und Wasserstoff ZSW the German Center for Solar Energy and Hydrogen Research in the State of Baden-W rttemberg a university industry collaboration in Stuttgart Ulm and Widderstall staffed by approximately scientists researchers engineers and technicians The plant develops new near-production manufacturing materials and processes NPMM P using a computerized Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition SCADA system It aims to enable the expansion of rechargeable battery production with increased quality and lower cost From onwards a new project by the German Research Foundation focuses on molecular photoswitches to store solar thermal energy The spokesperson of these so-called molecular solar thermal MOST systems is Prof Dr Hermann A Wegner United States edit In research and test centers opened to evaluate energy storage technologies Among them was the Advanced Systems Test Laboratory at the University of Wisconsin at Madison in Wisconsin State which partnered with battery manufacturer Johnson Controls The laboratory was created as part of the university s newly opened Wisconsin Energy Institute Their goals include the evaluation of state-of-the-art and next generation electric vehicle batteries including their use as grid supplements The State of New York unveiled its New York Battery and Energy Storage Technology NY-BEST Test and Commercialization Center at Eastman Business Park in Rochester New York at a cost of million for its almost m laboratory The center includes the Center for Future Energy Systems a collaboration between Cornell University of Ithaca New York and the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy New York NY-BEST tests validates and independently certifies diverse forms of energy storage intended for commercial use On September Senators Al Franken of Minnesota and Martin Heinrich of New Mexico introduced Advancing Grid Storage Act AGSA which would devote more than billion in research technical assistance and grants to encourage energy storage in the United States In grid models with high VRE share the excessive cost of storage tends to dominate the costs of the whole grid for example in California alone share of VRE would require TWh of storage but would require TWh According to another study supplying of US demand from VRE would require a smart grid covering the whole country or battery storage capable to supply the whole system for hours both at cost estimated at trillion United Kingdom edit In the United Kingdom some industry and government agencies allied with seven British universities in May to

planning concerns itself with the decision making processes where they are required for managing relationships that exist within and between natural systems and human systems Environmental planning endeavors to manage these processes in an effective orderly transparent and equitable manner for the benefit of all constituents within such systems for the present and for the future Present day environmental planning practices are the result of continuous refinement and expansion of the scope of such decision making processes Some of the main elements of present-day environmental planning are Social and economic development Urban development Regional development Natural resource management and integrated land use Infrastructure systems Governance frameworks The environmental planning assessments encompass areas such as land use socio-economics transportation economic and housing characteristics air pollution noise pollution the wetlands habitat of the endangered species flood zones susceptibility coastal zones erosion and visual studies among others and is referred to as an Integrated environmental planning assessment It is the ability to analyze environmental issues that will facilitate critical decision making Many environmental planning actions currently revolve around the reduction of emissions and material reuse not adaptations in order to lessen future climate change impacts This is most frequently seen as a result of the difficulty of predicting the long term effects of climate change Climate action is very complex in nature and the timeline of emissions mitigation is unpredictable However as an alternative to avoiding adaptation several cities in the US have taken an anticipatory governance approach This method intends to explore the uncertainty surrounding the impacts of climate change specific to their communities in order to include adaptation in their environmental planning Environmental justice edit Environmental justice is the equitable inclusion and treatment of all human beings in all aspects of environmental planning as well as in the enforcement of environmental legislation It is increasingly recognized as a key part of environmental planning Environmental justice issues are usually fought within communities to establish environmentally-friendly and accessible neighborhoods and living conditions and to improve the local ecology The Environmental Protection Agency has declared it essential that residents should play an active role in the reshaping of their neighborhoods Many levels of government and international organizations agree on the need for equitable and sustainable housing and transportation as core characteristics of environmental justice these are considered today a part of the battle against the climate crisis Environmental activists act as watchdogs on government support for the battles of underrepresented communities against environmental hazards that threaten their health or way of life United States edit In the United States of America there have been numerous examples of the state provisioning of environmental justice in multiple communities Listed are some of such projects The Phillips community in Minneapolis Minnesota The Phillips community began a campaign against the city of Minneapolis to halt the construction of a garbage transfer station in their neighborhood The city was ordered for the demolition of twenty-eight homes for the site amassing ten acres of land this project was soon stopped by the aforementioned Phillips neighborhood The people of Phillips established an organization known as the Green Institute afterwards in order to repurpose this vacant ten-acre lot The Green Institute partnered with the city of Minneapolis to create sustainable business enterprises to ultimately bolster the job market while improving Minneapolis environment by reducing waste and promoting clean energy techniques With funding from the city government of Minneapolis the Green Institute has established city-wide projects such as the ReUse Center and the DeConstruction service The ReUse Center s services provide systems to repurpose scavenged construction materials so that building waste is reduced the DeConstruction service assists those who want to collect discarded construction materials from demolition or building sites to reclaim With these services it is estimated that up to percent of unused structures can be repurposed and then sold for new uses This idea for the Green Institute first drummed up by the citizens of the Phillips community was quickly incorporated as a government-funded project that advocates for environmental justice North America edit Canada edit In Canada Planners safeguard the health and well-being of urban and rural communities by addressing the use of land resources facilities and services with consideration to physical economic and social efficiency as stated on the Canadian Institute of Planners official website United States edit Local municipals around the US are implementing Climate Action Plans CAPs as urban areas grow However the level of detail is variable some act more as motivational goals while others are a concrete plan for implementation In the United States for any project environmental planners deal with a full range of environmental regulations from federal to state and city levels administered federally by the Environmental Protection Agency A rigorous environmental process has to be undertaken to examine the impacts and possible mitigation of any construction project was Depending on the scale and impact of the project an extensive environmental review is known as an Environmental Impact Statement EIS and the less extensive version is Environmental Assessment EA Procedures follow guidelines from National Environmental Policy Act NEPA State Environmental Quality Review Act SEQRA and or City Environmental Quality Review CEQR and other related federal or state agencies published regulations Eccleston has developed a set of tools and techniques for solving NEPA and environmental planning problems A study found that the best may to minimize information asymmetry and goal incongruence between organizations working to implement environmental policy is to focus on principal-agent dynamics thus avoiding conflict and allowing for progress in addressing environmental issues The Association of Environmental Professionals AEP is a non-profit organization of interdisciplinary professionals including environmental science resource management environmental planning and other professions contributing to this field AEP is the first organization of its kind in the US and its influence and model have spawned numerous other regional organizations throughout the United States Its mission is to improve the technical skills of members and the organization is dedicated to the enhancement maintenance and protection of the natural and human environment From inception in the mid- s the organization has been closely linked with the maintenance of the California Environmental Quality Act CEQA due to California being one of the first states to adopt a comprehensive legal framework to govern the environmental review of public policy and project review Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design LEED in the major qualification system for green building It is a certification system created by the U S Green Building Council USGBC and is used worldwide The program includes certifications for new types of buildings as well as existing building that are candidates for modification The multi-tiered point system enables building to be certified beyond local state and federal standards LEED standards play an important role in quantifying a building s environmental impact encouraging sustainable environmental practices and acting as a hybrid between material objects and human practices Asia edit Philippines edit In the Philippines Republic Act governs the practice of Environmental Planning The law defines environmental planning as a multi-disciplinary art and science of analyzing specifying clarifying harmonizing managing and regulating the use and development of land and water resources in relation to their environs for the development of sustainable communities and ecosystems It is sometimes referred to as urban and regional planning city planning town and country planning or human settlements planning An Environmental Planner is a person who is registered and licensed to practice environmental planning in the Philippines To be a licensed environmental planner an individual must hold a valid Certificate of Registration issued by the Professional Regulation Commission PRC To obtain these credentials candidates must pass the Environmental Planning Board Exam Currently there is a proposal to require a Bachelor of Science in Environmental Planning as a requisite for becoming a licensed environmental planner with the change expected to take effect within five years As of this writing the curriculum for the BS Environmental Planning program is under review by the Commission on Higher Education CHED The Philippine Institute of Environmental Planners PIEP is the only accredited professional organization for environmental planners in the Philippines PIEP serves as the official body for advancing the profession and ensuring environmental planners adhere to high professional standards Australia edit Planning in Australia has shifted from a focus on amenity and resource use to a more integrated approach Australia incorporated environmental considerations in land-use planning following the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment This alignment with global trends reflected a shift towards integrated development planning that considers environmental impacts New South Wales edit In NSW the first attempt to incorporate environmental assessment and protection into planning law began in with the appointment of a Planning and Environment Commission to overhaul the existing predominately urban land-use system After various delays the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act EP A Act came into force on September The EP A Act establishes a framework for assessing the environmental and community impacts of development proposals It requires varying levels of assessment based on significance and considers input from regulatory bodies and the public The Act has been updated to give the government more influence in approvals while also incorporating environmental protection measures Victoria edit The Environment Effects Act was the first environmental planning control in Victoria and it assessed the environmental impact of significant developments via an Environmental Effects Statement EES However the obligation for presenting an EES remained somewhat unclear and is ultimately at the discretion of the Minister for Planning Eccles and Bryant The Planning and Environment Act created a statewide nested planning process Victoria Planning Provisions VPP which has within the statewide objectives the protection of natural and man-made resources and the maintenance of ecological processes and genetic diversity PaE Act s To achieve these ends the VPP includes several overarching policy frameworks including the identification of important environmental values and assets such as protection of catchments waterways and groundwater coastal areas and Conservation of native flora and fauna Below this level local planning schemes identify land-uses through Zone designation and also identify land affected by other criteria called overlays Overlays include environmental parameters such as Environmental Significance Vegetation Protection Erosion Management and Wildfire Management but also social issues like Neighbourhood Character Below this again are various regulations on particular issues such as details pertaining to regulation of areas of Native Vegetation DSE Victoria Reform has occurred to the Victorian framework in recent years aimed at improving land use and transport outcomes including consideration of environmental impacts The Transport Integration Act identifies key planning agencies as interface bodies required to have regard to a vision for the transport system and objectives and decision making principles if decisions are likely to have a significant impact on Victoria s transport system In addition the Major Transport Projects Facilitation Act establishes a scheme to improve the approval and delivery of major rail road and ports projects South Australia edit Planning in South Australia is coordinated within the Development Act Under this law most urban and land-use planning is assessed against local plans of allowed development The Minister must declare a proposed development either Major Development or a Major Project for it to be subjected to greater depth of environmental assessment and public consultation via an independent Development Assessment Commission of experts Complex proposals will generally require an indepth EIS Planning SA Queensland edit The Integrated Planning Act vested most planning control with local government but required significant projects to be assessed by a State Coordinator General and usually required an environmental impact statement EIS This has been replaced by the Sustainable Planning Act which came into force December This law aims to improve sustainable environmental outcomes through streamlined processes and incorporates Statewide Regional and local planning hierarchies which follow the model of Victoria s VPP The Coordinator General may still declare projects to be significant projects which then require assessment under the State Development and Public Works Organisation Act Qld Europe edit Over the past decade the European Union has given the environment more attention with more strict legislation on issues such as air soil and water pollution as well regulations for toxic and hazardous substances Currently over of the territory belonging to the EU is denoted as protected areas for nature To date the European Union s Environmental Policy is determined by the th Environmental Action Programme and is expected to be followed up through The EU has goals beyond this however and hopes by to have an innovative circular economy where nothing is wasted and where natural resources are managed sustainably and biodiversity is protected valued and restored in ways that enhance our society s resilience The EU has three core objectives to help achieve this vision conservation of natural resources conversion to an efficient environmentally sustainable economy and protection of the health of citizens Professional qualifications edit Environmental planning qualifications are offered in a number of forms by various universities throughout the world The following are some of the qualifications offered by tertiary education institutions Bachelor of Resource and Environmental Planning Bachelor of Environmental Studies Bachelor of Planning and Environmental Policy Master in Environmental Planning e g at the Technische

transit Personal rapid transit Category Renewable energy portal v t e Environmental technology or envirotech is the use of engineering and technological approaches to understand and address issues that affect the environment with the aim of fostering environmental improvement It involves the application of science and technology in the process of addressing environmental challenges through environmental conservation and the mitigation of human impact to the environment The term is sometimes also used to describe sustainable energy generation technologies such as photovoltaics wind turbines etc Purification and waste management edit Water purification edit A view across a reverse osmosis desalination plant in Spain This section is an excerpt from Water purification edit Typical drinking water treatment processes Water purification is the process of removing undesirable chemicals biological contaminants suspended solids and gases from water The goal is to produce water that is fit for specific purposes Most water is purified and disinfected for human consumption drinking water but water purification may also be carried out for a variety of other purposes including medical pharmacological chemical and industrial applications The history of water purification includes a wide variety of methods The methods used include physical processes such as filtration sedimentation and distillation biological processes such as slow sand filters or biologically active carbon chemical processes such as flocculation and chlorination and the use of electromagnetic radiation such as ultraviolet light Water purification can reduce the concentration of particulate matter including suspended particles parasites bacteria algae viruses and fungi as well as reduce the concentration of a range of dissolved and particulate matter The standards for drinking water quality are typically set by governments or by international standards These standards usually include minimum and maximum concentrations of contaminants depending on the intended use of the water A visual inspection cannot determine if water is of appropriate quality Simple procedures such as boiling or the use of a household point of use water filter typically with activated carbon are not sufficient for treating all possible contaminants that may be present in water from an unknown source Even natural spring water considered safe for all practical purposes in the th century must now be tested before determining what kind of treatment if any is needed Chemical and microbiological analysis while expensive are the only way to obtain the information necessary for deciding on the appropriate method of purification Air purification edit Air purification describes the processes used to remove contaminants and pollutants from the air to reduce the potential adverse effects on humans and the environment The process of air purification may be performed using methods such as mechanical filtration ionization activated carbon adsorption photocatalytic oxidation and ultraviolet light germicidal irradiation Sewage treatment edit This section is an excerpt from Sewage treatment edit Sewage treatment is a type of wastewater treatment which aims to remove contaminants from sewage to produce an effluent that is suitable to discharge to the surrounding environment or an intended reuse application thereby preventing water pollution from raw sewage discharges Sewage contains wastewater from households and businesses and possibly pre-treated industrial wastewater There are a large number of sewage treatment processes to choose from These can range from decentralized systems including on-site treatment systems to large centralized systems involving a network of pipes and pump stations called sewerage which convey the sewage to a treatment plant For cities that have a combined sewer the sewers will also carry urban runoff stormwater to the sewage treatment plant Sewage treatment often involves two main stages called primary and secondary treatment while advanced treatment also incorporates a tertiary treatment stage with polishing processes and nutrient removal Secondary treatment can reduce organic matter measured as biological oxygen demand from sewage using aerobic or anaerobic biological processes A quaternary treatment step sometimes referred to as advanced treatment can also be added for the removal of organic micropollutants such as pharmaceuticals This has been implemented in full-scale in Sweden A large number of sewage treatment technologies have been developed mostly using biological treatment processes Design engineers and decision makers need to take into account technical and economical criteria of each alternative when choosing a suitable technology Often the main criteria for selection are desired effluent quality expected construction and operating costs availability of land energy requirements and sustainability aspects In developing countries and in rural areas with low population densities sewage is often treated by various on-site sanitation systems and not conveyed in sewers These systems include septic tanks connected to drain fields on-site sewage systems OSS and vermifilter systems On the other hand advanced and relatively expensive sewage treatment plants may include tertiary treatment with disinfection and possibly even a fourth treatment stage to remove micropollutants At the global level an estimated of sewage is treated However sewage treatment rates are highly unequal for different countries around the world For example while high-income countries treat approximately of their sewage developing countries treat an average of just The treatment of sewage is part of the field of sanitation Sanitation also includes the management of human waste and solid waste as well as stormwater drainage management The term sewage treatment plant is often used interchangeably with the term wastewater treatment plant page needed Environmental remediation edit Environmental remediation is the process through which contaminants or pollutants in soil water and other media are removed to improve environmental quality The main focus is the reduction of hazardous substances within the environment Some of the areas involved in environmental remediation include soil contamination hazardous waste groundwater contamination oil gas and chemical spills There are three most common types of environmental remediation These include soil water and sediment remediation Soil remediation consists of removing contaminants in soil as these pose great risks to humans and the ecosystem Some examples of this are heavy metals pesticides and radioactive materials Depending on the contaminant the remedial processes can be physical chemical thermal or biological Water remediation is one of the most important considering water is an essential natural resource Depending on the source of water there will be different contaminants Surface water contamination mainly consists of agricultural animal and industrial waste as well as acid mine drainage There has been a rise in the need for water remediation due to the increased discharge of industrial waste leading to a demand for sustainable water solutions The market for water remediation is expected to consistently increase to billion by Sediment remediation consists of removing contaminated sediments Is it almost similar to soil remediation except it is often more sophisticated as it involves additional contaminants To reduce the contaminants it is likely to use physical chemical and biological processes that help with source control but if these processes are executed correctly there s a risk of contamination resurfacing Solid waste management edit Solid waste management is the purification consumption reuse disposal and treatment of solid waste that is undertaken by the government or the ruling bodies of a city town It refers to the collection treatment and disposal of non-soluble solid waste material Solid waste is associated with both industrial institutional commercial and residential activities Hazardous solid waste when improperly disposed can encourage the infestation of insects and rodents contributing to the spread of diseases Some of the most common types of solid waste management include landfills vermicomposting composting recycling and incineration However a major barrier for solid waste management practices is the high costs associated with recycling and the risks of creating more pollution E-Waste Recycling edit The recycling of electronic waste e-waste has seen significant technological advancements due to increasing environmental concerns and the growing volume of electronic product disposals Traditional e-waste recycling methods which often involve manual disassembly expose workers to hazardous materials and are labor-intensive Recent innovations have introduced automated processes that improve safety and efficiency allowing for more precise separation and recovery of valuable materials Modern e-waste recycling techniques now leverage automated shredding and advanced sorting technologies which help in effectively segregating different types of materials for recycling This not only enhances the recovery rate of precious metals but also minimizes the environmental impact by reducing the amount of waste destined for landfills Furthermore research into biodegradable electronics aims to reduce future e-waste through the development of electronics that can decompose more naturally in the environment These advancements support a shift towards a circular economy where the lifecycle of materials is extended and environmental impacts are significantly minimized Bioremediation edit Bioremediation is a process that uses microorganisms such as bacteria fungi plant enzymes and yeast to neutralize hazardous containments that can be in the environment This could help mitigate a variety of environmental hazards including oil spills pesticides heavy metals and other pollutants Bioremediation can be conducted either on-site in situ or off-site ex situ which is often necessary if the climate is too cold Factors influencing the duration of bioremediation would include to the extent of the contamination environmental conditions and with timelines that can range from months to years Examples edit Biofiltration Bioreactor Bioremediation Composting toilet Desalination Thermal depolymerization Pyrolysis Sustainable energy edit Main article Sustainable energy Net Zero Court zero emissions office building prototype in St Louis Missouri Concerns over pollution and greenhouse gases have spurred the search for sustainable alternatives to fossil fuel use The global reduction of greenhouse gases requires the adoption of energy conservation as well as sustainable generation That environmental harm reduction involves global changes such as substantially reducing methane emissions from melting perma-frost animal husbandry pipeline and wellhead leakage virtually eliminating fossil fuels for vehicles heat and electricity carbon dioxide capture and sequestration at point of combustion widespread use of public transport battery and fuel cell vehicles extensive implementation of wind solar water generated electricity reducing peak demands with carbon taxes and time of use pricing citation needed Since fuel used by industry and transportation account for the majority of world demand by investing in conservation and efficiency using less fuel pollution and greenhouse gases from these two sectors can be reduced around the globe Advanced energy-efficient electric motor and electric generator technology that are cost-effective to encourage their application such as variable speed generators and efficient energy use can reduce the amount of carbon dioxide CO and sulfur dioxide SO that would otherwise be introduced to the atmosphere if electricity were generated using fossil fuels Some scholars have expressed concern that the implementation of new environmental technologies in highly developed national economies may cause economic and social disruption in less-developed economies Renewable energy edit Main article Renewable energy Renewable energy is the energy that can be replenished easily For years we have been using sources such as wood sun water etc for means for producing energy Energy that can be produced by natural objects like the sun wind etc is considered to be renewable Technologies that have been in usage include wind power hydropower solar energy geothermal energy and biomass bioenergy It refers to any form of energy that naturally regenerates over time and does not run out This form of energy naturally replenishes and is characterized by a low carbon footprint Some of the most common types of renewable energy sources include solar power wind power hydroelectric power and bioenergy which is generated by burning organic matter Examples edit The Tesla Roadster was the first all-electric sports car for sale and in serial production It can completely recharge from the electrical grid in to hours depending on the outlet used Energy saving modules Heat pump Hydrogen fuel cell Hydroelectricity Ocean thermal energy conversion Photovoltaic Solar power Wave energy Wind power Wind turbine Renewable Energy Innovations edit The intersection of technology and sustainability has led to innovative solutions aimed at enhancing the efficiency of renewable energy systems One such innovation is the integration of wind and solar power to maximize energy production Companies like Un ole are pioneering technologies that combine solar panels with wind turbines on the same platform which is particularly advantageous for urban environments with limited space This hybrid system not only conserves space but also increases the energy yield by leveraging the complementary nature of solar and wind energy availability Furthermore advancements in offshore wind technology have significantly increased the viability and efficiency of wind energy Modern offshore wind turbines feature improvements in structural design and aerodynamics which enhance their energy capture and reduce costs These turbines are now more adaptable to various marine environments allowing for greater flexibility in location and potentially reducing visual pollution The floating wind turbines for example use tension leg platforms and spar buoys that can be deployed in deeper waters significantly expanding the potential areas for wind energy generation Such innovations not only advance the capabilities of individual renewable technologies but also contribute to a more resilient and sustainable energy grid By optimizing the integration and efficiency of renewable resources these technologies play a crucial role in the transition towards a sustainable energy future Energy conservation edit Energy conservation is the utilization of devices that require smaller amounts of energy in order to reduce the consumption of electricity Reducing the use of electricity causes less fossil fuels to be burned to provide that electricity And it refers to the practice of using less energy through changes in individual behaviors and habits The main emphasis for energy conservation is the prevention of wasteful use of energy in the environment to enhance its availability Some of the main approaches to energy conservation involve refraining from using devices that consume more energy where possible eGain forecasting edit Egain forecasting is a method using forecasting technology to predict the future weather s impact on a building By adjusting the heat based on the weather forecast the system eliminates redundant use of heat thus reducing the energy consumption and the emission of greenhouse gases It is a technology introduced by the eGain International a Swedish company that intelligently balances building power consumption The technology involves forecasting the amount of heating energy required by a building within a specific period which results in energy efficiency and sustainability eGain lowers building energy consumption and emissions while determining time for maintenance where inefficiencies are observed Solar power edit This section is an excerpt from Solar power edit Rooftop solar in Hong Kong The first three concentrated solar power CSP units of Spain s Solnova Solar Power Station in the foreground with the PS and PS solar power towers in the background Solar power also known as solar electricity is the conversion of energy from sunlight into electricity either directly using photovoltaics PV or indirectly using concentrated solar power Solar panels use the photovoltaic effect to convert light into an electric current Concentrated solar power systems use lenses or mirrors and solar tracking systems to focus a large area of sunlight to a hot spot often to drive a steam turbine Photovoltaics PV were initially solely used as a source of electricity for small and medium-sized applications from the calculator powered by a single solar cell to remote homes powered by an off-grid rooftop PV system Commercial concentrated solar power plants were first developed in the s Since then as the cost of solar panels has fallen grid-connected solar PV systems capacity and production has doubled about every three years Three-quarters of new generation capacity is solar with both millions of rooftop installations and gigawatt-scale photovoltaic power stations continuing to be built In solar power generated of global electricity and over of primary energy by the substitution method adding twice as much new electricity as coal Along with onshore wind power utility-scale solar is the source with the cheapest levelised cost of electricity for new installations in most countries China has about half the world s solar power Almost half the solar power installed in was mounted on rooftops Much more low-carbon power is needed for electrification and to limit climate change The International Energy Agency said in that more effort was needed for grid integration and the mitigation of policy regulation and financing challenges Nevertheless solar may greatly cut the cost of energy Solar is important for energy security Computational sustainability edit This section is an excerpt from Computational sustainability edit This article may incorporate text from a large language model It may

divestment Investment Companies governments and households have been investing increasing amounts in decarbonisation including renewable energy electric vehicles and associated infrastructure energy storage energy-efficient heating systems carbon capture and storage and hydrogen energy Fossil fuel phase-out is the proposed gradual global reduction of the use and production of fossil fuels to zero to reduce air pollution limit climate change and strengthen energy independence It is part of the ongoing renewable energy transition Many countries are shutting down coal-fired power stations and fossil-fuelled electricity generation is thought to have peaked But electricity generation is not moving off coal fast enough to meet climate goals Many countries have set dates to stop selling petrol and diesel cars and trucks but a timetable to stop burning fossil gas has not yet been agreed Current efforts in fossil fuel phase-out involve replacing fossil fuels with sustainable energy sources in sectors such as transport and heating Alternatives to fossil fuels include electrification green hydrogen and biofuel Phase-out policies include both demand-side and supply-side measures Whereas demand-side approaches seek to reduce fossil-fuel consumption supply-side initiatives seek to constrain production to accelerate the pace of energy transition and reduction in emissions It has been suggested that laws should be passed to make fossil fuel companies bury the same amount of carbon as they emit The International Energy Agency estimates that in order to achieve carbon neutrality by the middle of the century global investments in renewable energy must triple by reaching over trillion annually As of global use of fossil fuels is increasing continuing the trend since if not earlier

circular economy and biobased economy e g bioplastics are being developed to reduce plastic pollution the fossil fuel phase out specifically aims to end the burning of fossil fuels and the consequent production of greenhouse gases Therefore attempts to reduce the use of oil and gas in the plastic industry do not form part of fossil fuel phase-out or reduction plans Types of fossil fuels edit Main article Fossil fuel Coal edit Main article Coal phase-out See also Beyond Coal The annual amount of coal plant capacity being retired increased into the mid- s However the rate of retirement has since stalled and global coal phase-out is not yet compatible with the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement In parallel with retirement of some coal plant capacity other coal plants are still being added though the annual amount of added capacity has been declining since the s To meet the Paris Agreement target of keeping global warming to well below C F coal use needs to halve from to However as of update coal supplied over a quarter of the world s primary energy and about of the greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels Phasing out coal has short-term health and environmental benefits which exceed the costs and without it the C target in the Paris Agreement cannot be met but some countries still favour coal and there is much disagreement about how quickly it should be phased out As of update countries and many sub-national governments and businesses had become members of the Powering Past Coal Alliance each making a declaration to advance the transition away from unabated abated means with carbon capture and storage CCS but almost all power plants are unabated as CCS is so expensive coal power generation As of update however the countries which use the most coal have not joined and some countries continue to build and finance new coal-fired power stations A just transition from coal is supported by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development In the UN Secretary General said that countries should stop building new coal power plants from or face total disaster In although China built some plants globally more coal power was retired than built the UN Secretary General has said that OECD countries should stop generating electricity from coal by and the rest of the world by Oil edit The Deepwater Horizon oil spill discharges million barrels m See also Peak oil Crude oil is refined into fuel oil diesel and petrol The refined products are primarily for transportation by conventional cars trucks trains planes and ships Popular alternatives are human-powered transport public transport electric vehicles and biofuels The IISD has suggested a plan for oil and gas phase-out but OPEC has called it a fantasy Natural gas edit See also Natural gas Environmental effects and Peak gas Natural gas well in Germany Natural gas is widely used to generate electricity and has an emission intensity of about g kWh Heating is also a major source of carbon dioxide emissions Leaks are also a large source of atmospheric methane In some countries natural gas is being used as a temporary bridge fuel to replace coal in turn to be replaced by renewable sources or a hydrogen economy However this bridge fuel may significantly extend the use of fossil fuel or strand assets such as gas-fired power plants built in the s as the average plant life is years Although natural gas assets are likely to be stranded later than oil and coal assets perhaps not until some investors are concerned by reputational risk Fossil gas phase-out has progressed in some regions for example with increasing use of hydrogen by the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Gas ENTSOG and changes to building regulations to reduce the use of gas heating As residential consumers move to electricity gas grid operation and maintenance may become harder to fund Global Fossil Fuel Energy usage - Reasons edit Commonly cited reasons for phasing out fossil fuels are to reduce deaths and illness caused by air pollution limit climate change reduce fossil fuel subsidies strengthen energy independence countries with low or no fossil fuel deposits often transition away from fossil fuels to gain energy independently citation needed Health edit See also Air pollution Health effects Most of the millions of premature deaths from air pollution are due to fossil fuels Pollution may be indoors e g from heating and cooking or outdoors from vehicle exhaust One estimate is that the proportion is and the number million each year According to Professor Sir Andy Haines at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine the health benefits of phasing out fossil fuels measured in money estimated by economists using the value of life for each country are substantially more than the cost of achieving the C goal of the Paris Agreement Climate change mitigation edit Fossil-fuel phase-out is the largest part of limiting global warming as fossil fuels account for over of greenhouse gas emissions In the International Energy Agency said that to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement the phase-out of fossil fuels would need to move four times faster To achieve the goal of limiting global warming to C above pre-industrial levels the vast majority of fossil fuel reserves owned by countries and companies as of would have to remain in the ground Employment edit This section needs expansion You can help by adding to it October The renewable energy transition can create jobs through the construction of new power plants and the manufacturing of the equipment that they need as was seen in the case of Germany and the wind power industry Energy independence edit Almost three-quarters of the global population live in countries that are net importers of fossil fuels Countries which lack fossil fuel deposits particularly coal but also petroleum and natural gas often cite energy independence in their shift away from fossil fuels In Switzerland the decision to electrify virtually the entire railway network was taken in light of the two world wars during which Switzerland was neutral when coal imports became increasingly difficult As Switzerland has ample hydropower resources electric trains as opposed to those driven by steam locomotives or diesel could be run on domestic energy resources reducing the need for coal imports The oil crisis also led to a shift in energy policy in many places to become more independent of fossil fuel imports In France the government announced an ambitious plan to expand nuclear power which by the end of the s had shifted France s electricity sector almost entirely away from coal gas and oil and towards nuclear power The trend towards encouraging cycling in the Netherlands and Denmark also coincided with the oil crisis and aimed in part at reducing the need for oil imports in the transportation sector Phase-out of fossil fuel subsidies edit This section is in list format but may read better as prose You can help by converting this section if appropriate Editing help is available June See also Fossil fuel subsidies Phase-out Significant fossil fuel subsidies are present in many countries Fossil fuel subsidies in for consumption totalled US billion spread over many countries As of update governments subsidise fossil fuels by about billion per year however using an unconventional definition of subsidy which includes failing to price greenhouse gas emissions the International Monetary Fund estimated that fossil fuel subsidies were trillion in which was of global GDP Some fossil fuel companies lobby governments Phasing out fossil fuel subsidies is crucial to address the climate crisis according to whom It must however be done carefully to avoid protests according to whom and making poor people poorer In most cases however low fossil fuel prices benefit wealthier households more than poorer households So to help poor and vulnerable people other measures than fossil fuel subsidies would be more targeted according to whom This could in turn increase public support for subsidy reform Economic theory indicates that the optimal policy would be to remove coal mining and burning subsidies and replace them with optimal clarification needed taxes according to whom Global studies indicate that even without introducing taxes subsidy and trade barrier removal at a sectoral level would improve efficiency and reduce environmental damage Removal of these subsidies would substantially reduce greenhouse gas emissions and create jobs in renewable energy The IMF estimated in that removal of fossil fuel subsidies would limit global heating to the Paris goal of substantially less than C The actual effects of removing fossil fuel subsidies would depend heavily on the type of subsidy removed and the availability and economics of other energy sources obsolete source There is also the issue of carbon leakage where removal of a subsidy to an energy-intensive industry could lead to a shift in production to another country with less regulation and thus to a net increase in global emissions In developed countries energy costs are low and heavily subsidised whereas in developing countries the poor pay high costs for low-quality services In studies have put forward a plan to power of the world s energy with wind hydroelectric and solar power by the year It recommends transfer of energy subsidies from fossil fuel to renewable and a price on carbon reflecting its cost for flood cyclone hurricane drought and related extreme weather expenses Excluding subsidies the levelised cost of electricity from new large-scale solar power in India and China has been below existing coal-fired power stations since A study by Rice University Center for Energy Studies suggested the following steps for countries Countries should commit to a specific time frame for a full phaseout of implicit and explicit fossil fuel subsidies Clarify the language on subsidy reform to remove ambiguous terminology Seek formal legislation in affected countries that codifies reform pathways and reduces opportunities for backsliding Publish transparent formulas for market-linked pricing and adhere to a regular schedule for price adjustments Phase-in full reforms in a sequence of gradual steps Increasing prices gradually but on a defined schedule signals intent to consumers while allowing time to invest in energy efficiency to partially offset the increases Aspire to account for externalities over time by imposing a fee or tax on fossil energy products and services and eliminating preferences for fossil fuels that remain embedded in the tax code Use direct cash transfers to maintain benefits for poor segments of society rather than preserving subsidised prices for vulnerable socioeconomic groups Launch a comprehensive public communications campaign Any remaining fossil fuel subsidies should be clearly budgeted at full international prices and paid for by the national treasury Document price and emissions changes with reporting requirements Phasing-out specific processes edit Further information Coal phase-out Phase-out of fossil fuel power plants edit See also Energy transition and renewable energy By investment in the energy transition had grown to about twice that for fossil fuels oil natural gas and coal In renewables overtook fossil fuels as the European Union s main source of electricity for the first time Energy efficiency is complementary to the use of sustainable energy sources when phasing-out fossil fuels Phase-out of fossil fuel vehicles edit Main article Phase-out of fossil fuel vehicles Sales of electric vehicles EVs indicate a trend away from gas-powered vehicles that generate greenhouse gases Many countries and cities have introduced bans on the sales of new internal combustion engine ICE vehicles requiring all new cars to be electric vehicles or otherwise powered by clean non-emitting sources Such bans include the United Kingdom by and Norway by Many transit authorities are working to purchase only electric buses while also restricting use of ICE vehicles in the city center to limit air pollution Many US states have a zero-emissions vehicle mandate incrementally requiring a certain per cent of cars sold to be electric The German term Verkehrswende traffic transition analogous to Energiewende energetic transition calls for a shift from combustion powered road transport to bicycles walking and rail transport and the replacement of remaining road vehicles with electric traction Biofuels in the form of liquid fuels derived from plant materials are entering the market However many of the biofuels that are currently being supplied have been criticised for their adverse impacts on the natural environment food security and land use Oil fuel phase-out edit The standard Hubbert curve plotting crude oil production of a region over time World energy consumption Source International Energy Outlook The mitigation of peak oil is the attempt to delay the date and minimize the social and economic effects of peak oil by reducing the consumption of and reliance on petroleum citation needed By reducing petroleum consumption mitigation efforts seek to favorably change the shape of the Hubbert curve which is the graph of real oil production over time predicted by Hubbert peak theory The peak of this curve is known as peak oil and by changing the shape of the curve the timing of the peak in oil production is affected An analysis by the author of the Hirsch report showed that while the shape of the oil production curve can be affected by mitigation efforts mitigation efforts are also affected by the shape of Hubbert curve For the most part mitigation involves fuel conservation and the use of alternative and renewable energy sources The development of unconventional oil resources can extend the supply of petroleum but does not reduce consumption Historically world oil consumption data show that mitigation efforts during the and oil shocks lowered oil consumption while general recessions since the s have had no effect on curbing the oil consumption until citation needed In the United States oil consumption declines in reaction to high prices Key questions for mitigation are the viability of methods the roles of government and private sector and how early these solutions are implemented The responses to such questions and steps taken towards mitigation may determine whether or not the lifestyle of a society can be maintained and may affect the population capacity of the planet The most effective method of mitigating peak oil is to use renewable or alternative energy sources in place of petroleum Because most oil is consumed for transportation most mitigation discussions revolve around transportation issues Mobile applications edit See also Biofuel Hydrogen economy Methanol economy and Hydrogen-powered aircraft Due to its high energy density and ease of handling oil has a unique role as a transportation fuel There are however a number of possible alternatives Among the biofuels the use of bioethanol and biodiesel is already established to some extent in some countries The use of hydrogen fuel is another alternative under development in various countries alongside hydrogen vehicles though hydrogen is actually an energy storage medium not a primary energy source and consequently the use of a non-petroleum source would be required to extract the hydrogen for use Though hydrogen is currently outperformed in terms of cost and efficiency by battery powered vehicles citation needed there are applications where it would come in useful Short haul ferries and very cold climates are two examples Hydrogen fuel cells are about a third as efficient as batteries and double the efficiency of petrol vehicles Alternative aviation fuel edit An Airbus A flew on alternative fuel for the first time on February At that stage Boeing also had plans to use alternative fuel on the Because some biofuels such as ethanol contains less energy more tankstops might be necessary for such planes The US Air Force is currently in the process of certifying its entire fleet to run on a blend of synthetic fuel derived from the Fischer Tropsch process and JP- jet fuel Studies edit Reduction in fossil fuel capacity compared to renewables Renewable energy sources especially solar photovoltaic and wind power are providing an increasing share of power capacity In electricity generation from wind and solar sources was projected to exceed by as fossil fuels use continues to decline The countries most reliant on fossil fuels for electricity vary widely on how great a percentage of that electricity is generated from renewables leaving wide variation in renewables growth potential In Greenpeace and Climate Action Network Europe released a report highlighting the need for an active phase-out of coal-fired generation across Europe Their analysis derived from a database of coal plants and included emissions data from official EU registries A report by Oil Change International concludes that the carbon emissions embedded in the coal oil and gas in currently working mines and fields assuming that these run to the end of their working lifetimes will take the world to just beyond the C limit contained in the Paris Agreement and even further from the C goal The report observes that one of the most powerful climate policy levers is also the simplest stop digging for more fossil fuels In the Overseas Development Institute ODI and other NGOs released a report on the impact of building new coal-fired power plants in countries where a significant proportion of the population lacks access to electricity The report concludes that on the whole building coal-fired power plants does little to help the poor and may make them poorer Moreover wind and solar generation are beginning to challenge coal on cost A study in Nature Energy suggests that countries in Europe could completely phase out coal-fired electricity generation with their current infrastructure whilst the United States and Russia could phase out at least In the Fossil Fuel Cuts Database provided the first global account of supply-side initiatives to constrain fossil fuel production The latest update of the database recorded initiatives implemented between and October in countries across seven major types of supply-side approaches Divestment n Blockades n Litigation n Moratoria and Bans n Production subsidies removal n Carbon tax on fossil fuel production n Emissions Trading Schemes n The GeGaLo index of geopolitical gains and losses assesses how the geopolitical position of countries may change if the world fully transitions to renewable energy resources Former fossil fuel exporters are expected to lose power while the positions of former fossil fuel importers and countries rich in renewable energy resources is expected to strengthen Multiple decarbonisation plans that get to zero CO emissions have been presented A Guardian investigation showed in that big fossil fuel firms continue to plan huge investments in new fossil fuel production projects that would drive the climate past internationally agreed temperature limits Renewable energy potentials edit In June Dr Sven Teske and Dr Sarah Niklas from the Institute for Sustainable Futures University of Technology Sydney found that existing coal oil and gas production puts the world on course to overshoot Paris climate targets In co-operation with the Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty Initiative they published a report entitled Fossil Fuel Exit Strategy An orderly wind down of coal oil and gas to meet the Paris Agreement It analyses global renewable energy potential and finds that every region on Earth can replace fossil fuels with renewable energy to keep warming below C and provide reliable energy access to all Assessment of extraction prevention responsibilities edit In September the first scientific assessment of the minimum amount of fossil fuels that would need to be secured from extraction per region as well as globally to allow for a probability of limiting global warming by to C was provided Challenges edit Net income of the global oil and gas industry reached a record US trillion in After recovering from the COVID- pandemic energy company profits increased with greater revenues from higher fuel prices resulting from the Russian invasion of Ukraine falling debt levels tax write-downs of projects shut down in Russia and backing off from earlier plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions Record profits sparked public calls for windfall taxes The phase-out of fossil fuels involves many challenges and one of them is the reliance that the world currently has on them In fossil fuels provided over of the primary energy consumption of the world Fossil fuel phase-out may lead to an increment in electricity prices because of the new investments needed to replace their share in the electricity mix with alternative energy sources obsolete source Another impact of a phase-out of fossil fuels is in employment In the case of employment in the fossil fuel industry a phase-out is logically undesired therefore people employed in the industry will usually oppose any measures that put their industries under scrutiny Endre Tvinnereim and Elisabeth Ivarsflaten studied the relationship between employment in the fossil fuel industry with the support to climate change policies They proposed that one opportunity for displaced drilling employments in the fossil fuel industry could be in the geothermal energy industry This was suggested as a result of their conclusion people and companies in the fossil fuel industry will likely oppose measures that endanger their employment unless they have other stronger alternatives This can be extrapolated to political interests that can push against the phase-out of fossil fuels initiative One example is how the vote of United States Congress members is related to the preeminence of fossil fuel industries in their respective states Other challenges include ensuring sustainable recycling sourcing of the required materials disruptions of existing power structures managing variable renewable energy developing optimal national transition policies transforming transportation infrastructure and responsibilities of fossil fuel extraction prevention There is active research and development on such issues According to the people present at COP in Egypt Saudi Arabian representatives pushed to block a call for the world to burn less oil After objections from Saudi Arabia and a few other oil producers summit s final statement failed to include a call for nations to phase out fossil fuels In March at a United Nations meeting with climate scientists Saudi Arabia together with Russia pushed to delete a reference to human-induced climate change from an official document disputing the scientifically established fact that the burning of fossil fuels by humans is the main driver of the climate crisis Overall fossil fuels are still being used in ever increasing quantities at least up until Major initiatives and legislation edit China edit China has pledged to become carbon neutral by which would need a just transition for over million workers in the coal-mining and power industry It is not yet clear whether China aims to phase-out all fossil fuel use by that date or whether a small proportion will still be in use with the carbon captured and stored In coal mining was ordered to run at maximum capacity European Union edit At the end of the European Union launched its European Green Deal It included a revision of the Energy Taxation Directive which is looking closely at fossil fuel subsidies and tax exemptions aviation shipping a circular economy action plan a review and possible revision where needed of the all relevant climate-related policy instruments including the Emissions Trading System a sustainable and smart mobility strategy potential carbon tariffs for countries that don t curtail their greenhouse gas pollution at the same rate The mechanism to achieve this is called the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism CBAM It also leans on Horizon Europe to play a pivotal role in leveraging national public and private investments Through partnerships with industry and member States it will support research and innovation on transport technologies including batteries clean hydrogen low-carbon steel making circular bio-based sectors and the built environment The European Investment Bank contributed over billion to help the energy industry between and in line with EU energy policy This comprised nearly billion for initiatives related to power grids energy efficiency and renewable energy throughout Europe and other parts of the world Germany edit Germany has pledged to become carbon neutral by Speaking at the COP climate summit in Dubai German Chancellor Olaf Scholz called for a phase-out of fossil fuels including coal oil and natural gas and reiterated Germany s commitment to be climate neutral by saying The technologies are there wind power photovoltaics electric motors green hydrogen India edit India is confident of exceeding Paris COP commitments In the Paris Agreement India has committed to an Intended Nationally Determined Contributions target of achieving of its total electricity generation from non-fossil fuel sources by Japan edit This section needs expansion You can help by adding to it October Japan has pledged to become carbon neutral by United Kingdom edit See also Energy policy of the United Kingdom The UK is legally committed to be carbon neutral by and moving away from the heating of homes by natural gas is likely to be the most difficult part of the country s fossil fuel phase out Alternative green recovery legislative plans have been proposed by multiple groups to phase out fossil fuels as fast as technology allows Voices of support edit Protest at the Legislative Building in Olympia Washington Ted Nation a long-time environmental activist beside protest sign Prominent individuals supporting a coal moratorium or phase-out US politician Al Gore stated If you re a young person looking at the future of this planet and looking at what is being done right now and not done I believe we have reached the stage where it is time for civil disobedience to prevent the construction of new coal plants that do not have carbon capture and sequestration Eric Schmidt then CEO of Google called for replacing all fossil fuels with renewable sources of energy in twenty years Christiana Figueres then executive secretary of

Renewable energy portal v t e Green building is a technique that aims to create structures that are environmentally responsible and resource-efficient throughout their lifecycle including siting design construction operation maintenance renovation and demolition A report by the U S General Services Administration evaluated sustainably designed GSA buildings and found they cost less to operate Wood products from responsible sources are a good choice for most green building projects both new construction and renovations Wood grows naturally using energy from the sun and is renewable sustainable and recyclable It is an effective insulator and uses far less energy to produce than concrete or steel Wood can also mitigate climate change because wood products continue to store carbon absorbed by the tree during its growing cycle and because substituting wood for fossil fuel-intensive materials such as steel and concrete result in avoided greenhouse gas emissions Life cycle assessment edit A life cycle assessment can help avoid a narrow outlook on environmental social and economic concerns by assessing each and every impact associated with all the stages of a process from cradle to grave i e from raw materials through materials processing manufacture distribution use repair and maintenance and disposal or recycling A comprehensive review of scientific literature from Europe North America and Australia pertaining to life cycle assessment of wood products concluded among other things Fossil fuel consumption the potential contributions to the greenhouse effect and the quantities of solid waste tend to be minor for wood products compared to competing products Wood products that have been installed and are used in an appropriate way tend to have a favorable environmental profile compared to functionally equivalent products out of other materials A study by the Canadian Wood Council compared the life cycle impacts of three -square-foot m homes designed primarily in wood steel and concrete over the first years of their lifespans Relative to the wood design the steel and concrete designs released more air pollution produced more solid wastes used more resources required more energy emitted more greenhouse gases and discharged more water pollution When the complete life cycle is considered including use and disposal the great majority of the studies indicate that wood products have lower greenhouse gas emissions In the few cases where wood products cause greater greenhouse gas emissions than their non-wood counterparts the cause was inappropriate post-use disposal Tools are available that enable architects to judge the relative environmental merits of building materials They include the ATHENA Impact Estimator for Buildings which is capable of modeling of the building stock in North America and the ATHENA EcoCalculator for Assemblies provides instant life cycle assessment results for common assemblies based on detailed assessments previously conducted using the Estimator The EcoCalculator is available free from the non-profit Athena Sustainable Materials Institute in order to encourage greater use of LCA by design and building professionals Wood and climate change edit Some examples of wooden buildings Trees absorb carbon dioxide and store it in biomass wood leaves roots When trees decompose or burn much of the stored carbon is released back into the atmosphere mainly as carbon dioxide and some of the carbon remains in the forest debris and soils Harvested wood is used for products such as structural lumber or furniture the carbon is stored for decades or longer A typical -square-foot m home in North America contains metric tons of carbon or the equivalent of offsetting the greenhouse gas emissions produced by driving a passenger car over five years about liters of gasoline When wood replaces a fossil fuel for energy or a construction material with a greater greenhouse gas footprint this lowers greenhouse gas emissions Studies show that wood products are associated with far less greenhouse gas emissions over their lifetime than other major building materials Substituting a cubic meter of blocks or brick with wood results in a significant saving of to one tone of carbon dioxide Increasing the use of wood products in construction and for other long-lived uses plus the use of wood byproducts and wood waste as biomass replacement for fossil fuels can contribute to atmospheric greenhouse gas stabilization The sustainable management of forests for the production of wood products is a feasible and beneficial part of an overall strategy to mitigate climate change Securing the Future a United Kingdom government strategy for sustainable development stated Forestry practices can make a significant contribution by reducing greenhouse gas emissions through increasing the amount of carbon removed from the atmosphere by the national forest estate by burning wood for fuel and by using wood as a substitute for energy-intensive materials such as concrete and steel The role of wood in carbon balances edit FPInnovations a Canadian non-profit research organization conducted a literature review of scientific peer-reviewed articles regarding the net impact on atmospheric greenhouse gases due to wood product use within a life cycle perspective It showed several ways wood product substitution affects greenhouse gas balances including Less fossil fuel consumption in manufacturing Avoidance of industrial process carbon emissions from cement manufacturing when wood products replace cement-based products Carbon storage in wood products and in the forest and Avoided fossil fuel emissions when wood biofuels replace fossil fuels Energy efficiency edit As high-performance buildings use less operating energy the embodied energy required to extract process transport and install building materials may make up as much as of the overall life cycle energy consumption Studies such as the U S LCI Database Project show buildings built primarily with wood will have a lower embodied energy than those built primarily with brick concrete or steel A recent case study of the Eugene Kruger Building in Quebec Canada determined that the all-wood solution adopted for this -square-metre academic building resulted in a reduction in embodied energy compared to steel and concrete alternatives A study compared production energy values for building components e g walls floors roofs made predominantly of wood steel and concrete and found that wood construction has a range of energy use from to Gigajoules GJ concrete from to GJ and steel from to GJ Wood construction will generally use less energy than other materials although the high end of the range of wood construction energy overlaps with the low end of the range of concrete construction The passive design uses natural processes convection absorption radiation and conduction to minimize energy consumption and improve thermal comfort Researchers in Europe have identified wood as a suitable material for the development of passive buildings due to its unique combination of properties including thermal resistance natural finish structural integrity and lightweight and weatherproof qualities Passive design is beginning to be incorporated in small buildings in North America through the use of structural wood panels Due to its cellular structure and many tiny air pockets wood is a better insulator than steel and concrete in most climates times better than steel and times better than concrete More insulation is needed for steel and concrete to achieve the same thermal performance A study prepared by the National Association of Home Builders Research Center Inc compared long-term energy use in two nearly identical side-by-side homes one framed with conventional dimensional lumber and the second framed with cold-formed steel It found the steel-framed house used more natural gas in the winter and more electricity in the summer Health and well-being edit Solid wood products particularly flooring are often specified in environments where occupants are known to have allergies to dust or other particulates Wood itself is considered to be hypo-allergenic and its smooth surfaces prevent the buildup of particles common in soft finishes like carpet The use of wood products can also improve air quality by absorbing or releasing moisture in the air to moderate humidity A study at the University of British Columbia and FPInnovations found that the visual presence of wood in a room lowers sympathetic nervous system SNS activation in occupants further establishing the positive link between wood and human health SNS activation is the way human bodies prepare themselves to deal with stress It increases blood pressure and heart rate while inhibiting digestion recovery and repair functions in order to deal with immediate threats While necessary in the short term prolonged periods in an SNS-activated state have a negative effect on the body s physiological and psychological health The study supports wood s value as a tool in evidence-based design EBD a growing field that seeks to promote health and other positive outcomes such as increased productivity and well-being based on scientifically credible evidence So far EBD has focused largely on healthcare and in particular patient recovery Reducing waste edit Wooden pallets used on a building s exterior to filter sunlight Green building seeks to avoid wasting energy water and materials during construction Design and building professionals can reduce construction waste through design optimization using right-sized framing members for example or pre-manufactured and engineered components The wood industry reduces waste in a similar way by optimizing sawmill operations and by using wood chips and sawdust to produce paper and composite products or as fuel for renewable bioenergy North American wood producers use percent of every tree harvested and brought to a mill Rather than demolishing structures at the end of their useful life they can be deconstructed to reclaim useful building materials rather than dumping them in the landfill When used properly wood concrete and steel can last for decades or centuries In North America most structures are demolished because of external forces such as zoning changes and rising land values Designing for flexibility and adaptability secures the greatest value for the embodied energy in building materials Wood is versatile and flexible making it the easiest construction material for renovations Wood buildings can be redesigned to suit changing needs whether this involves adding a new room or moving a window or door Wood structures are typically easy to adapt to new uses because the material is so light and easy to work with Few homeowner or professional remodelers have the skill and equipment needed to alter steel-frame structures Structural wood members can typically be reclaimed and reused for the same or similar purpose with only minor modifications or wastage or remilled and fashioned into alternate products such as window and door frames To reduce the amount of wood that goes to landfill the CO Neutral Alliance a coalition of government NGOs and the forest industry created the website dontwastewood com The site includes resources for regulators municipalities developers contractors owner operators and individuals homeowners looking for information on wood recycling Responsible sourcing edit Wood is a responsible environmental choice for construction as long as it comes from forests that are managed sustainably Illegal logging and the international trade in illegally logged timber is a major problem for many timber-producing countries in the developing world It causes environmental damage costs governments billions of dollars in lost revenue promotes corruption undermines the rule of law and good governance and funds armed conflict Consumer countries can use their buying power by ensuring the wood products they buy are from known and legal sources Deforestation which is the permanent removal of forests where the land is converted to other uses such as agriculture or housing is also a significant problem in developing countries and globally accounts for of the world s greenhouse gas emissions The forests most vulnerable to destruction are in tropical regions of the world where the rate of deforestation was estimated at acres km a year from to According to the State of the World s Forests Report the world lost about percent of its forest area from to but in North America the total forest area remained virtually constant When forest land is converted for other uses a portion of the deforestation can be offset by afforestation such as the planting of trees on land that has been bare of trees for a long time Voluntary third-party forest certification is a credible tool for communicating the environmental and social performance of forest operations With forest certification an independent organization develops standards of good forest management and independent auditors issue certificates to forest operations that comply with those standards This certification verifies that forests are well-managed as defined by a particular standard and ensures that certified wood and paper products come from legal and responsible sources Green building rating systems edit A study by the Light House Sustainable Building Centre in British Columbia Canada examined the ways in which the world s major voluntary green building rating systems incorporate wood It found that rating systems for single-family homes in North America were the most inclusive of wood products and rating systems for commercial buildings and buildings outside of North America were the least inclusive Systems studied included BREEAM United Kingdom Built Green United States and Canada CASBEE Japan Green Globes United States Green Star Australia LEED launched in United States and used in countries such as Canada China India and Mexico Living Building Challenge United States and Canada the NAHB National Green Building Program United States and the SB Tool Canada and UK In most cases the rating systems offer credits point for the use of wood in the following areas certified wood recycled reused salvaged materials and local sourcing of materials In some cases building techniques and skills such as advanced framing and waste minimization are recognized and most demand that all wood adhesives resins engineered and composite products contain no added urea formaldehyde and have strict limits on VOC volatile organic compound content LEED certified wood credit edit See also Certified wood In December the U S Green Building Council failed to get enough yes votes from members for a proposed rewrite of the certified wood policy in its Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design LEED rating system Since its inception LEED has only accepted wood certified to Forest Stewardship Council standards The two largest third-party forest certification standards in the United States the Forest Stewardship Council FSC and the Sustainable Forestry Initiative SFI opposed the proposed benchmarks FSC questioned their rigor and SFI claimed the process was overly detailed and complex A number of organizations including the National Association of State Foresters the Canadian Institute of Forestry and the Society of American Foresters called for LEED to recognize all credible certification programs to encourage the use of wood as a green building material In its - Forest Products Annual Review the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe Food and Agriculture Organization stated that green building initiatives GBI can be a mixed blessing for wood products GBI standards giving exclusive recognition to particular forest-certification brands may help drive demand for these brands at the expense of wider appreciation of the environmental merits of wood In its review the UNECE FAO reported growing convergence between certification systems Over the years many of the issues that previously divided the certification systems have become much less distinct The largest certification systems now generally have the same structural programmatic requirements

of rating systems for the design construction operation and maintenance of green buildings developed by the U S Green Building Council Other certification systems that confirm the sustainability of buildings are the British BREEAM Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method for buildings and large-scale developments or the DGNB System Deutsche Gesellschaft f r Nachhaltiges Bauen e V which benchmarks the sustainability performance of buildings indoor environments and districts Currently the World Green Building Council is conducting research on the effects of green buildings on the health and productivity of their users and is working with the World Bank to promote green buildings in Emerging Markets through EDGE Excellence in Design for Greater Efficiencies Market Transformation Program and certification There are also other tools such as NABERS or Green Star in Australia Global Sustainability Assessment System GSAS used in the Middle East and the Green Building Index GBI predominantly used in Malaysia Building information modeling BIM is a process involving the generation and management of digital representations of the physical and functional characteristics of places Building information models BIMs are files often but not always in proprietary formats and containing proprietary data which can be extracted exchanged or networked to support decision-making regarding a building or other built asset Current BIM software is used by individuals businesses and government agencies who plan design construct operate and maintain diverse physical infrastructures such as water refuse electricity gas communication utilities roads railways bridges ports and tunnels Although new technologies are constantly being developed to complement current practices in creating greener structures the common objective of green buildings is to reduce the overall impact of the built environment on human health and the natural environment by Efficiently using energy water and other resources Protecting occupant health and improving employee productivity see healthy building Reducing waste pollution and environmental degradation Natural building is a similar concept usually on a smaller scale and focusing on the use of locally available natural materials Other related topics include sustainable design and green architecture Sustainability may be defined as meeting the needs of present generations without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs Although some green building programs do not address the issue of retrofitting existing homes others do especially through public schemes for energy efficient refurbishment Green construction principles can easily be applied to retrofit work as well as new construction A report by the U S General Services Administration found that sustainably designed buildings cost less to operate and have excellent energy performance In addition occupants were overall more satisfied with these buildings than those in typical commercial buildings These are eco-friendly buildings Reducing environmental impact edit Buildings represent a large part of energy electricity water and materials consumption As of they account for of global energy use and energy-related CO emissions which the United Nations estimates contributed to of overall worldwide emissions Including the manufacturing of building materials the global CO emissions were If new technologies in construction are not adopted during this time of rapid growth emissions could double by according to the United Nations Environment Program Glass buildings especially all-glass skyscrapers contribute significantly to climate change due to their energy inefficiency While these structures are visually appealing and allow abundant natural light they also trap heat necessitating increased use of air conditioning systems which contributes to higher carbon emissions Experts advocate for design modifications and potential restrictions on all-glass edifices to mitigate their detrimental environmental impact Buildings account for a large amount of land According to the National Resources Inventory approximately million acres km of land in the United States are developed The International Energy Agency released a publication that estimated that existing buildings are responsible for more than of the world s total primary energy consumption and for of global carbon dioxide emissions According to Global status report from the year buildings consume more than of all produced energy The report states that Under a below C trajectory effective action to improve building energy efficiency could limit building final energy demand to just above current levels meaning that the average energy intensity of the global building stock would decrease by more than by Hanging gardens of One Central Park Sydney Green building practices aim to reduce the environmental impact of building as the building sector has the greatest potential to deliver significant cuts in emissions at little or no cost General guidelines can be summarized as follows Every building should be as small as possible Avoid contributing to sprawl even if the most energy-efficient environmentally sound methods are used in design and construction Bioclimatic design principles are able to reduce energy expenditure and by extension carbon emissions Bioclimatic design is a method of building design that takes local climate into account to create comfortable conditions within the structure This could be as simple as constructing a different shape for the building envelope or facing the building towards the south to maximize solar exposure for energy or lighting purposes Given the limitations of city planned construction bioclimatic principles may be employed on a lesser scale however it is still an effective passive method to reduce environmental impact Goals of green building edit Blu Homes mkSolaire a green building designed by Michelle Kaufmann Shanghai Tower the tallest and largest LEED Platinum certified building in the world since The concept of sustainable development can be traced to the energy especially fossil oil crisis and environmental pollution concerns of the s and s The Rachel Carson book Silent Spring published in is considered to be one of the first efforts to describe sustainable development as related to green building The green building movement in the U S originated from the need and desire for more energy efficient and environmentally friendly construction practices There are a number of motives for building green including environmental economic and social benefits However modern sustainability initiatives call for an integrated and synergistic design to both new construction and in the retrofitting of existing structures Also known as sustainable design this approach integrates the building life-cycle with each green practice employed with a design-purpose to create a synergy among the practices used Green building brings together a vast array of practices techniques and skills to reduce and ultimately eliminate the impacts of buildings on the environment and human health It often emphasizes taking advantage of renewable resources e g using sunlight through passive solar active solar and photovoltaic equipment and using plants and trees through green roofs rain gardens and reduction of rainwater run-off Many other techniques are used such as using low-impact building materials or using packed gravel or permeable concrete instead of conventional concrete or asphalt to enhance replenishment of groundwater While the practices or technologies employed in green building are constantly evolving and may differ from region to region fundamental principles persist from which the method is derived siting and structure design efficiency energy efficiency water efficiency materials efficiency indoor environmental quality enhancement operations and maintenance optimization and waste and toxics reduction The essence of green building is an optimization of one or more of these principles Also with the proper synergistic design individual green building technologies may work together to produce a greater cumulative effect On the aesthetic side of green architecture or sustainable design is the philosophy of designing a building that is in harmony with the natural features and resources surrounding the site There are several key steps in designing sustainable buildings specify green building materials from local sources reduce loads optimize systems and generate on-site renewable energy Life cycle assessment edit A life cycle assessment LCA can help avoid a narrow outlook on environmental social and economic concerns by assessing a full range of impacts associated with all cradle-to-grave stages of a process from extraction of raw materials through materials processing manufacture distribution use repair and maintenance and disposal or recycling Impacts taken into account include among others embodied energy global warming potential resource use air pollution water pollution and waste In terms of green building the last few years have seen a shift away from a prescriptive approach which assumes that certain prescribed practices are better for the environment toward the scientific evaluation of actual performance through LCA Although LCA is widely recognized as the best way to evaluate the environmental impacts of buildings ISO provides a recognized LCA methodology it is not yet a consistent requirement of green building rating systems and codes despite the fact that embodied energy and other life cycle impacts are critical to the design of environmentally responsible buildings In North America LCA is rewarded to some extent in the Green Globes rating system and is part of the new American National Standard based on Green Globes ANSI GBI - Green Building Protocol for Commercial Buildings LCA is also included as a pilot credit in the LEED system though a decision has not been made as to whether it will be incorporated fully into the next major revision The state of California also included LCA as a voluntary measure in its draft Green Building Standards Code Although LCA is often perceived as overly complex and time-consuming for regular use by design professionals research organizations such as BRE in the UK and the Athena Sustainable Materials Institute in North America are working to make it more accessible In the UK the BRE Green Guide to Specifications offers ratings for building materials based on LCA Siting and structure design efficiency edit See also Sustainable design The foundation of any construction project is rooted in the concept and design stages The concept stage in fact is one of the major steps in a project life cycle as it has the largest impact on cost and performance In designing environmentally optimal buildings the objective is to minimize the total environmental impact associated with all life-cycle stages of the building project Exterior Light Shelves - Green Office Building Denver Colorado However building as a process is not as streamlined as an industrial process and varies from one building to the other never repeating itself identically In addition buildings are much more complex products composed of a multitude of materials and components each constituting various design variables to be decided at the design stage A variation of every design variable may affect the environment during all the building s relevant life-cycle stages Energy efficiency edit Main articles Low-energy house and Zero-energy building An eco-house at Findhorn Ecovillage with a turf roof and solar panels Green buildings often include measures to reduce energy consumption both the embodied energy required to extract process transport and install building materials and operating energy to provide services such as heating and power for equipment As high-performance buildings use less operating energy embodied energy has assumed much greater importance and may make up as much as of the overall life cycle energy consumption Studies such as the U S LCI Database Project show buildings built primarily with wood will have a lower embodied energy than those built primarily with brick concrete or steel To reduce operating energy use designers use details that reduce air leakage through the building envelope the barrier between conditioned and unconditioned space They also specify high-performance windows and extra insulation in walls ceilings and floors Another strategy passive solar building design is often implemented in low-energy homes Designers orient windows and walls and place awnings porches and trees to shade windows and roofs during the summer while maximizing solar gain in the winter In addition effective window placement daylighting can provide more natural light and lessen the need for electric lighting during the day Solar water heating further reduces energy costs Onsite generation of renewable energy through solar power wind power hydro power or biomass can significantly reduce the environmental impact of the building Power generation is generally the most expensive feature to add to a building Energy efficiency for green buildings can be evaluated from either numerical or non-numerical methods These include use of simulation modelling analytical or statistical tools In a report published in April the International Energy Agency IEA highlighted that buildings are responsible for about of global final energy consumption and over of electricity demand It noted the tripling of heat pump sales from to electric cars accounting for of vehicle sales and a potential doubling of China s peak electricity demand by mid-century India s air conditioner ownership could see a tenfold rise by causing a sixfold increase in peak electricity demand which could be halved with efficient practices By demand response measures might lower household electricity bills by to in advanced economies and nearly in developing ones with smart device installations nearly doubling by The US could see a GW reduction in peak demand million tonnes less CO per year by and save between USD billion and USD billion over twenty years with grid-interactive buildings In Alabama a smart neighborhood demonstrated to energy savings compared to traditional homes Water efficiency edit See also Water conservation Reducing water consumption and protecting water quality are key objectives in sustainable building One critical issue of water consumption is that in many areas the demands on the supplying aquifer exceed its ability to replenish itself To the maximum extent feasible facilities should increase their dependence on water that is collected used purified and reused on-site The protection and conservation of water throughout the life of a building may be accomplished by designing for dual plumbing that recycles water in toilet flushing or by using water for washing of the cars Waste-water may be minimized by utilizing water conserving fixtures such as ultra-low flush toilets and low-flow shower heads Bidets help eliminate the use of toilet paper reducing sewer traffic and increasing possibilities of re-using water on-site Point of use water treatment and heating improves both water quality and energy efficiency while reducing the amount of water in circulation The use of non-sewage and greywater for on-site use such as site-irrigation will minimize demands on the local aquifer Large commercial buildings with water and energy efficiency can qualify for an LEED Certification Philadelphia s Comcast Center is the tallest building in Philadelphia It is also one of the tallest buildings in the USA that is LEED Certified Their environmental engineering consists of a hybrid central chilled water system which cools floor-by-floor with steam instead of water Burn s Mechanical set-up the entire renovation of the story million square foot sky scraper Materials and Sustainable Architecture edit The incorporation of green building materials in sustainable architecture significantly reduces the environmental impacts of construction and operation Green building materials are made of sustainable properties such as renewable resources lower energy consumption and minimal environmental degradation They also allow for the reduction of the depletion of natural resources For example green building materials in insulation can drastically reduce the need of depending on HVAC units in turn reducing energy consumption There is an emphasis on using materials and resources more efficiently throughout their life cycle beginning from construction to demolition In order to conserve natural resources the usage of recycled materials is crucial which will bring forth many advantages including the reduction of environmental impacts when it comes to the extraction of the resource since it will no longer create the demand for constant extraction Reduction of waste and pollution on-site is equally as important by implementing the usage of a modular design which allows for the prefabrication materials off-site reducing on-site waste The usage of zero waste materials will be preferred which will reduce the release of pollutants on-site as well Health benefits are also associated with the implementation of these materials Green building materials promote well-being for the occupants of the building When it comes to energy efficiency green building materials allow for a passive design strategy which optimizes the buildings orientation thermal mass and natural ventilation in order to minimize energy use for heating cooling and lighting This can be in the form of strategically placing windows and shading devices which would enhance natural daylight and reduce the need for artificial lighting One main focus of green building materials is the durability-to-resource ratio which refers to the longevity of the materials If the materials have a long life span then there will be a reduced need for frequent replacements or repairs These materials can also be given a new purpose after they have been used Some of the challenges associated with green building materials include a high initial cost and limited availability and accessibility However in the long run green building materials offer long-term savings because of its effects of reduced consumption lower maintenance costs and extended material life spans Materials efficiency edit See also Sustainable architecture and Material efficiency Building materials typically considered green include lumber that has been certified to a third-party standard rapidly renewable plant materials like bamboo and straw dimension stone recycled stone hempcrete recycled metal see copper sustainability and recyclability and other non-toxic reusable renewable and or recyclable products Materials with lower embodied energy can be used in substitution to common building materials with high degrees of energy consumption and carbon harmful emissions For concrete a high performance self-healing version is available however options with lower yields of pollutive waste entertain ideas of upcycling and congregate supplementing replacing traditional concrete mixes with slag production waste and aggregates Insulation also sees multiple angles for substitution Commonly used fiberglass has competition from other eco-friendly low energy embodying insulators with similar or higher R-values per inch of thickness at a competitive price Sheep wool cellulose and ThermaCork perform more efficiently however use may be limited by transportation or installation costs Furthermore embodied energy comparisons can help deduce the selection of building material and its efficiency Wood production emits less CO than concrete and steel if produced in a sustainable way just as steel can be produced more sustainably through improvements in technology e g EAF and energy recycling carbon capture an underutilized potential for systematically storing carbon in the built environment The EPA Environmental Protection Agency also suggests using recycled industrial goods such as coal combustion products foundry sand and demolition debris in construction projects Energy efficient building materials and appliances are promoted in the United States through energy rebate programs A report from the Boston Consulting Group found that investments in developing greener forms of cement iron and steel lead to bigger greenhouse gas reductions compared with investments in electricity and aviation In addition the process of making cement without producing CO is unavoidable However using pozzolans clinkers can reduce CO emission while in the process of making cement Indoor environmental quality enhancement edit See also Indoor air quality The Indoor Environmental Quality IEQ category in LEED standards one of the five environmental categories was created to enhance comfort well-being and productivity of occupants The LEED IEQ category addresses design and construction guidelines especially indoor air quality IAQ thermal quality and lighting quality Indoor Air Quality seeks to reduce volatile organic compounds or VOCs and other air impurities such as microbial contaminants Buildings rely on a properly designed ventilation system passively naturally or mechanically powered to provide adequate ventilation of cleaner air from outdoors or recirculated filtered air as well as isolated operations kitchens dry cleaners etc from other occupancies During the design and construction process choosing construction materials and interior finish products with zero or low VOC emissions will improve IAQ Most building materials and cleaning maintenance products emit gases some of them toxic such as many VOCs including formaldehyde These gases can have a detrimental impact on occupants health comfort and productivity Avoiding these products will increase a building s IEQ LEED HQE and Green Star contain specifications on use of low-emitting interior Draft LEED is about to expand the scope of the involved products BREEAM limits formaldehyde emissions no other VOCs MAS Certified Green is a registered trademark to delineate low VOC-emitting products in the marketplace The MAS Certified Green Program ensures that any potentially hazardous chemicals released from manufactured products have been thoroughly tested and meet rigorous standards established by independent toxicologists to address recognized long-term health concerns These IAQ standards have been adopted by and incorporated into the following programs The United States Green Building Council USGBC in its LEED rating system The California Department of Public Health CDPH in its Section standards The Collaborative for High Performance Schools CHPS in its Best Practices Manual The Business and Institutional Furniture Manufacturers Association BIFMA in its level sustainability standard Also important to indoor air quality is the control of moisture accumulation dampness to inhibit mold growth bacteria and viruses as well as dust mites and other organisms and microbiological pathogens Water intrusion through a building s envelope or water condensing on cold surfaces on the building s interior can enhance and sustain microbial growth A well-insulated and tightly sealed envelope will reduce moisture problems but adequate ventilation is also necessary to eliminate moisture from sources indoors including human metabolic processes cooking bathing cleaning and other activities Personal temperature and airflow control over the HVAC system coupled with a properly designed building envelope will also aid in increasing a building s thermal quality Creating a high-performance luminous environment through the careful integration of daylight and electrical light sources will improve the lighting quality and energy performance of a structure Solid wood products particularly flooring are often specified in environments where occupants are known to have allergies to dust or other particulates Wood itself is considered to be hypo-allergenic and its smooth surfaces prevent the buildup of particles common in soft finishes like carpet The Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America recommends hardwood vinyl linoleum tile or slate flooring instead of carpet The use of wood products can also improve air quality by absorbing or releasing moisture in the air to moderate humidity Interactions among all the indoor components and the occupants together form the processes that determine the indoor air quality Extensive investigation of such processes is the subject of indoor air scientific research and is well documented in the journal Indoor Air Operations and maintenance optimization edit No matter how sustainable a building may have been in its design and construction it can only remain so if it is operated responsibly and maintained properly Ensuring operations and maintenance O M personnel are part of the project s planning and development process will help retain the green criteria designed at the onset of the project Every aspect of green building is integrated into the O M phase of a building s life The addition of new green technologies also falls on the O M staff Although the goal of waste reduction may be applied during the design construction and demolition phases of a building s life-cycle it is in the O M phase that green practices such as recycling and air quality enhancement take place O M staff should aim to establish best practices in energy efficiency resource conservation ecologically sensitive products and other sustainable practices Education of building operators and occupants is key to effective implementation of sustainable strategies in O M services Waste reduction edit Green architecture also seeks to reduce waste of energy water and materials used during construction For example in California nearly of the state s waste comes from commercial buildings During the construction phase one goal should be to reduce the amount of material going to landfills Well-designed buildings also help reduce the amount of waste generated by the occupants as well by providing on-site solutions such as compost bins to reduce matter going to landfills To reduce the amount of wood that goes to landfill Neutral Alliance a coalition of government NGOs and the forest industry created the website dontwastewood com The site includes a variety of resources for regulators municipalities developers contractors owner operators and individuals homeowners looking for information on wood recycling When buildings reach the end of their useful life they are typically demolished and hauled to landfills Deconstruction is a method of harvesting what is commonly considered waste and reclaiming it into useful building material Extending the useful life of a structure also reduces waste building materials such as wood that are light and easy to work with make renovations easier To reduce the impact on wells or water treatment plants several options exist Greywater wastewater from sources such as dishwashing or washing machines can be used for subsurface irrigation or if treated for non-potable purposes e g to flush toilets and wash cars Rainwater collectors are used for similar purposes Centralized wastewater treatment systems can be costly and use a lot of energy An alternative to this process is converting waste and wastewater into fertilizer which avoids these costs and shows other benefits By collecting human waste at the source and running it to a semi-centralized biogas plant with other biological waste liquid fertilizer can be produced This concept was demonstrated by a settlement in L beck Germany in the late s Practices like these provide soil with organic nutrients and create carbon sinks that remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere offsetting greenhouse gas emission Producing artificial fertilizer is also more costly in energy than this process Reduce impact onto electricity network edit Electricity networks are built based on peak demand another name is peak load Peak demand is measured in the units of watts W It shows how fast electrical energy is consumed Residential electricity is often charged on electrical energy kilowatt hour kWh Green buildings or sustainable buildings are often capable of saving electrical energy but not necessarily reducing peak demand When sustainable building features are designed constructed and operated efficiently peak demand can be reduced so that there is less desire for electricity network expansion and there is less impact onto carbon emission and climate change These sustainable features can be good orientation sufficient indoor thermal mass good insulation photovoltaic panels thermal or electrical energy storage systems smart building home energy management systems Cost and payoff edit The most criticized issue about constructing environmentally friendly buildings is the price Photovoltaics new appliances and modern technologies tend to cost more money Most green buildings cost a premium of less than but yield times as much over the entire life of the building In regards to the financial benefits of green building Over years the financial payback typically exceeds the additional cost of greening by a factor of - times And broader benefits such as reductions in greenhouse gases GHGs and other pollutants have large positive impacts on surrounding communities and on the planet The stigma is between the knowledge of up-front cost vs life-cycle cost The savings in money come from more efficient use of utilities which result in decreased energy bills It is projected that different sectors could save billion on energy bills Also higher worker or student productivity can be factored into savings Numerous studies have shown the measurable benefit of green building initiatives on worker productivity In general it has been found that there is a direct correlation between increased productivity and employees who love being in their work space Specifically worker productivity can be significantly impacted by certain aspects of green building design such as improved lighting reduction of pollutants advanced ventilation systems and the use of non-toxic building materials In The Business Case for Green Building the U S Green Building Council gives another specific example of how commercial energy retrofits increase worker health and thus productivity People in the U S spend about of their time indoors EPA studies indicate indoor levels of pollutants may be up to ten times higher than outdoor levels LEED-certified buildings are designed to have healthier cleaner indoor environmental quality which means health benefits for occupants Studies have shown over a -year life period some green buildings have yielded to per square foot back on investment Confirming the rentability of green building investments further studies of the commercial real estate market have found that LEED and Energy Star certified buildings achieve significantly higher rents sale prices and occupancy rates as well as lower capitalization rates potentially reflecting lower investment risk Regulation and operation edit As a result of the increased interest in green building concepts and practices a number of organizations have developed standards codes and rating systems for use by government regulators building professionals and consumers In some cases codes are written so local governments can adopt them as bylaws to reduce the local environmental impact of buildings Green building rating systems such as BREEAM United Kingdom LEED United States and Canada DGNB Germany CASBEE Japan and VERDE GBCe Spain GRIHA India help consumers determine a structure s level of environmental performance They award credits for optional building features that support green design in categories such as location and maintenance of building site conservation of water energy and building materials and occupant comfort and health The number of credits generally determines the level of achievement Green building codes and standards such as the International Code Council s draft International Green Construction Code are sets of rules created by standards development organizations that establish minimum requirements for elements of green building such as materials or heating and cooling The new version of the European Construction Products Regulation PCR contains elements of Life Cycle Analysis and verification of Environmental Product Declarations under the System process Some of the major building environmental assessment tools currently in use include United States International Green Construction Code IGCC Green neighborhoods and villages edit Further information Ecovillage and Green cities At the beginning of the st century efforts were made to implement the principles of green building not only for individual buildings but also for neighborhoods and villages The intent is to create zero energy neighborhoods and villages which means they re going to create all the energy on their own They will also reuse waste implements sustainable transportation and produce their own food Green villages have been identified as a way to decentralize sustainable climate practices which may prove key in areas with high rural or scattered village populations such as India where of the population lives in over different villages International frameworks and assessment tools edit IPCC Fourth Assessment Report Climate Change the Fourth Assessment Report AR of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change IPCC is the fourth in a series of such reports The IPCC was established by the World Meteorological Organization WMO and the United Nations Environment Programme UNEP to assess scientific technical and socio-economic information concerning climate change its potential effects and options for adaptation and mitigation UNEP and Climate change United Nations Environment Program UNEP works to facilitate the transition to low-carbon societies support climate proofing efforts improve understanding of climate change science and raise public awareness about this global challenge GHG Indicator The Greenhouse Gas Indicator UNEP Guidelines for Calculating Greenhouse Gas Emissions for Businesses and Non-Commercial Organizations Agenda Agenda is a programme run by the United Nations UN related to sustainable development It is a comprehensive blueprint of action to be taken globally nationally and locally by organizations of the UN governments and major groups in every area in which humans impact on the environment The number refers to the st century FIDIC s PSM The International Federation of Consulting Engineers FIDIC Project Sustainability Management Guidelines were created to assist project engineers and other stakeholders in setting sustainable development goals for their projects that are recognized and accepted as being in the interests of society The process is also intended to align project goals with local conditions and priorities and assist those involved in managing projects to measure and verify their progress The Project Sustainability Management Guidelines are structured with Themes and Sub-Themes under the three main sustainability headings of Social Environmental and Economic For each individual Sub-Theme a core project indicator is defined along with guidance as to the relevance of that issue in the context of an individual project The Sustainability Reporting Framework provides guidance for organizations to use as the basis for disclosure about their sustainability performance and also provides stakeholders a universally applicable comparable framework in which to understand disclosed information The Reporting Framework contains the core product of the Sustainability Reporting Guidelines as well as Protocols and Sector Supplements The Guidelines are used as the basis for all reporting They are the foundation upon which all other reporting guidance is based and outline core content for reporting that is broadly relevant to all organizations regardless of size sector or location The Guidelines contain principles and guidance as well as standard disclosures including indicators to outline a disclosure framework that organizations can voluntarily flexibly and incrementally adopt Protocols underpin each indicator in the Guidelines and include definitions for key terms in the indicator compilation methodologies intended scope of the indicator and other technical references Sector Supplements respond to the limits of a one-size-fits-all approach Sector Supplements complement the use of the core Guidelines by capturing the unique set of sustainability issues faced by different sectors such as mining automotive banking public agencies and others IPD Environment Code The IPD Environment Code was launched in February The Code is intended as a good practice global standard for measuring the environmental performance of corporate buildings Its aim is to accurately measure and manage the environmental impacts of corporate buildings and enable property executives to generate high quality comparable performance information about their buildings anywhere in the world The Code covers a wide range of building types from offices to airports and aims to inform and support the following Creating an environmental strategy Inputting to real estate strategy Communicating a commitment to environmental improvement Creating performance targets Environmental improvement plans Performance assessment and measurement Life cycle assessments Acquisition and disposal of buildings Supplier management Information systems and data population Compliance with regulations Team and personal objectives IPD estimate that it will take approximately three years to gather significant data to develop a robust set of baseline data that could be used across a typical corporate estate ISO ISO TS Sustainability in building construction Framework for methods of assessment for environmental performance of construction works Part Buildings is intended to provide a general framework for improving the quality and comparability of methods for assessing the environmental performance of buildings It identifies and describes issues to be taken into account when using methods for the assessment of environmental performance for new or existing building properties in the design construction operation refurbishment and deconstruction stages It is not an assessment system in itself but is intended be used in conjunction with and following the principles set out in the ISO series of standards Development history edit In the s geothermal hot water district heating of houses started in Iceland In the s American architect Paul Soleri proposed

mechanical energy although the absorption heat pump instead uses thermal energy to transfer heat from one space to another The mechanical heat pump also known as a Cullen engine uses electric power to transfer heat by compression Specifically it transfers thermal energy by means of a heat pump and refrigeration cycle cooling one space and warming the other In winter a heat pump can move heat from the cool outdoors to warm a house in summer it may also be designed to move heat from the house to the warmer outdoors As it transfers rather than generates heat it is more energy-efficient than heating by gas boiler In a typical vapour-compression heat pump a gaseous refrigerant is compressed so its pressure and temperature rise When the pump operates as a heater in cold weather the warmed gas flows to a heat exchanger in the indoor space where some of its thermal energy is transferred to that space causing the gas to condense into a liquid The liquified refrigerant flows to a heat exchanger in the outdoor space where the pressure falls the liquid evaporates and the temperature of the gas falls Now colder than the temperature of the outdoor space being used as a heat source it can again take up energy from the heat source be compressed and repeat the cycle Air source heat pumps are the most common models while other types include ground source heat pumps water source heat pumps and exhaust air heat pumps Large-scale heat pumps are also used in district heating systems Because of their high efficiency and the increasing share of fossil -free sources in electrical grids heat pumps are playing a role in climate change mitigation At a cost of kWh of electricity they can transfer to kWh of thermal energy into a building The carbon footprint of heat pumps depends on how electricity is generated but they usually reduce emissions Heat pumps could satisfy over of global space and water heating needs with a lower carbon footprint than gas-fired condensing boilers however in they only met Operation edit Main articles Heat pump and refrigeration cycle and Vapor-compression refrigeration A indoor compartment B outdoor compartment I insulation condenser expansion valve evaporator compressor Heat flows spontaneously from a region of higher temperature to a region of lower temperature Heat does not flow spontaneously from lower temperature to higher but it can be made to flow in this direction if work is performed The work required to transfer a given amount of heat is usually much less than the amount of heat this is the motivation for using heat pumps in applications such as the heating of water and the interior of buildings The heat pump works by the use of reverse valves inside a heat pump enabling a switch from cooling to heating citation needed With this technology it directs the cold refrigerant into the indoor coil usually the unit inside a closet or in the attic with the fan then blowing warm air into the coil to absorb the heat making the air cool citation needed The amount of work required to provide an amount of heat Q to a higher-temperature reservoir such as the interior of a building while extracting heat from a lower-temperature reservoir such as ambient air is W Q C O P displaystyle W frac Q mathrm COP where W displaystyle W is the work performed on the working fluid by the heat pump s compressor Q displaystyle Q is the heat released in the higher-temperature reservoir C O P displaystyle mathrm COP is the instantaneous coefficient of performance for the heat pump at the temperatures prevailing in the reservoirs at one instant The coefficient of performance of a heat pump is greater than one so the work required is less than the heat released making a heat pump a more efficient form of heating than electrical resistance heating As the temperature of the higher-temperature reservoir increases in response to the heat flowing into it the coefficient of performance decreases causing an increasing amount of work to be required for each unit of heat being transferred The coefficient of performance and the work required by a heat pump can be calculated easily by considering an ideal heat pump operating on the reversed Carnot cycle If the low-temperature reservoir is at a temperature of K C and the interior of the building is at K C the maximum theoretical coefficient of performance is This means joule of work delivers joules of heat to the interior The one joule of work ultimately ends up as thermal energy in the interior of the building and joules of heat are moved from the low-temperature reservoir note As the temperature of the interior of the building rises progressively to K C the coefficient of performance falls progressively to This means each joule of work is responsible for transferring joules of heat out of the low-temperature reservoir and into the building Again the joule of work ultimately ends up as thermal energy in the interior of the building so joules of heat are added to the building interior note This is the theoretical amount of heat pumped but in practice it will be less for various reasons for example if the outside unit has been installed where there is not enough airflow More data sharing with owners and academics perhaps from heat meters could improve efficiency in the long run History edit Milestones William Cullen demonstrates artificial refrigeration Jacob Perkins patents a design for a practical refrigerator using dimethyl ether Lord Kelvin describes the theory underlying heat pumps Peter von Rittinger develops and builds the first heat pump In the period before heat pumps were for the time being pursued for vapour compression evaporation open heat pump process in salt works with their obvious advantages for saving wood and coal In Peter von Rittinger was the first to try to implement the idea of vapor compression in a small pilot plant Presumably inspired by Rittinger s experiments in Ebensee Antoine-Paul Piccard from the University of Lausanne and the engineer J H Weibel from the Weibel Briquet company in Geneva built the world s first really functioning vapor compression system with a two-stage piston compressor In this first heat pump in Switzerland was installed in the Bex salt works Aurel Stodola constructs a closed-loop heat pump water source from Lake Geneva which provides heating for the Geneva city hall to this day unreliable source During the First World War fuel prices were very high in Switzerland but it had plenty of hydropower In the period before and especially during the Second World War when neutral Switzerland was completely surrounded by fascist-ruled countries the coal shortage became alarming again Thanks to their leading position in energy technology the Swiss companies Sulzer Escher Wyss and Brown Boveri built and put in operation around heat pumps between and The main heat sources were lake water river water groundwater and waste heat Particularly noteworthy are the six historic heat pumps from the city of Zurich with heat outputs from kW to MW An international milestone is the heat pump built by Escher Wyss in to replace the wood stoves in the City Hall of Zurich To avoid noise and vibrations a recently developed rotary piston compressor was used This historic heat pump heated the town hall for years until Only then was it replaced by a new more efficient heat pump John Sumner City Electrical Engineer for Norwich installs an experimental water-source heat pump fed central heating system using a nearby river to heat new Council administrative buildings It had a seasonal efficiency ratio of average thermal delivery of kW and peak output of kW Robert C Webber is credited as developing and building the first ground-source heat pump First large scale installation the Royal Festival Hall in London is opened with a town gas -powered reversible water-source heat pump fed by the Thames for both winter heating and summer cooling needs The Kigali Amendment to phase out harmful refrigerants takes effect Types edit Air-source edit This section is an excerpt from Air source heat pump edit Heat pump on balcony of apartment An air source heat pump ASHP is a heat pump that can absorb heat from air outside a building and release it inside it uses the same vapor-compression refrigeration process and much the same equipment as an air conditioner but in the opposite direction ASHPs are the most common type of heat pump and usually being smaller tend to be used to heat individual houses or flats rather than blocks districts or industrial processes Air-to-air heat pumps provide hot or cold air directly to rooms but do not usually provide hot water Air-to-water heat pumps use radiators or underfloor heating to heat a whole house and are often also used to provide domestic hot water An ASHP can typically gain kWh thermal energy from kWh electric energy They are optimized for flow temperatures between and C and F suitable for buildings with heat emitters sized for low flow temperatures With losses in efficiency an ASHP can even provide full central heating with a flow temperature up to C F As of update about of building heating worldwide is from ASHPs They are the main way to phase out gas boilers also known as furnaces from houses to avoid their greenhouse gas emissions Air-source heat pumps are used to move heat between two heat exchangers one outside the building which is fitted with fins through which air is forced using a fan and the other which either directly heats the air inside the building or heats water which is then circulated around the building through radiators or underfloor heating which releases the heat to the building These devices can also operate in a cooling mode where they extract heat via the internal heat exchanger and eject it into the ambient air using the external heat exchanger Some can be used to heat water for washing which is stored in a domestic hot water tank Air-source heat pumps are relatively easy and inexpensive to install so are the most widely used type In mild weather coefficient of performance COP may be between and while at temperatures below around C F an air-source heat pump may still achieve a COP of to While older air-source heat pumps performed relatively poorly at low temperatures and were better suited for warm climates newer models with variable-speed compressors remain highly efficient in freezing conditions allowing for wide adoption and cost savings in places like Minnesota and Maine in the United States Ground source edit This section is an excerpt from Ground source heat pump edit A heat pump in combination with heat and cold storage A ground source heat pump also geothermal heat pump is a heating cooling system for buildings that use a type of heat pump to transfer heat to or from the ground taking advantage of the relative constancy of temperatures of the earth through the seasons Ground-source heat pumps GSHPs or geothermal heat pumps GHP as they are commonly termed in North America are among the most energy-efficient technologies for providing HVAC and water heating using less energy than can be achieved by use of resistive electric heaters Efficiency is given as a coefficient of performance CoP which is typically in the range - meaning that the devices provide - units of heat for each unit of electricity used Setup costs are higher than for other heating systems due to the requirement of installing ground loops over large areas or of drilling bore holes hence ground source is often installed when new blocks of flats are built Air-source heat pumps have lower set-up costs but have a lower CoP in very cold or hot weather Heat recovery ventilation edit Main article Heat recovery ventilation Exhaust air heat pumps extract heat from the exhaust air of a building and require mechanical ventilation Two classes exist Exhaust air-air heat pumps transfer heat to intake air Exhaust air-water heat pumps transfer heat to a heating circuit that includes a tank of domestic hot water Solar-assisted edit This section is an excerpt from Solar-assisted heat pump edit Hybrid photovoltaic-thermal solar panels of a SAHP in an experimental installation at Department of Energy at Polytechnic of Milan A solar-assisted heat pump SAHP is a system that combines a heat pump and thermal solar panels and or PV solar panels in a single integrated system Heat pumps require a low temperature heat source which can be provided by solar energy Typically these two technologies are used separately or only placing them in parallel to produce warm air or hot water In this system the solar thermal panel acts as the low temperature heat source and the heat produced feeds the heat pump s evaporator The goal of this system is to get high coefficient of performance COP and then produce energy in a more efficient and less expensive way Air source heat pumps which are preheated by solar air collectors have an additional benefit of lower maintenance as the outside fan unit can be protected from the harsh winter environment Solar PV energy can power the heat pump electrically to enable electrification of heating buildings and greenhouses These systems enable electrification of heating cooling and are normally driven by economics and decarbonization goals Such systems have been shown to be economic in the Middle East North America Asia and Europe It is possible to use any type of solar thermal system with air or liquid collectors sheet and tubes roll-bond heat pipe thermal plates or hybrid mono polycrystalline thin film in combination with the heat pump Using hybrid panels however is most preferred because it allows covering a part of the electricity demand of the heat pump and reduces the power consumption and consequently the variable costs of the system Water-source edit Water-source heat exchanger being installed A water-source heat pump works in a similar manner to a ground-source heat pump except that it takes heat from a body of water rather than the ground The body of water does however need to be large enough to be able to withstand the cooling effect of the unit without freezing or creating an adverse effect for wildlife The largest water-source heat pump was installed in the Danish city of Esbjerg in Others edit A thermoacoustic heat pump operates as a thermoacoustic heat engine without refrigerant but instead uses a standing wave in a sealed chamber driven by a loudspeaker to achieve a temperature difference across the chamber Electrocaloric heat pumps are solid state Applications edit The International Energy Agency estimated that as of heat pumps installed in buildings have a combined capacity of more than GW They are used for heating ventilation and air conditioning HVAC and may also provide domestic hot water and tumble clothes drying The purchase costs are supported in various countries by consumer rebates Space heating and sometimes also cooling edit In HVAC applications a heat pump is typically a vapor-compression refrigeration device that includes a reversing valve and optimized heat exchangers so that the direction of heat flow thermal energy movement may be reversed The reversing valve switches the direction of refrigerant through the cycle and therefore the heat pump may deliver either heating or cooling to a building Because the two heat exchangers the condenser and evaporator must swap functions they are optimized to perform adequately in both modes Therefore the Seasonal Energy Efficiency Rating SEER in the US or European seasonal energy efficiency ratio of a reversible heat pump is typically slightly less than those of two separately optimized machines For equipment to receive the US Energy Star rating it must have a rating of at least SEER Pumps with ratings of SEER or above are considered highly efficient The highest efficiency heat pumps manufactured are up to SEER Heating seasonal performance factor in the US or Seasonal Performance Factor in Europe are ratings of heating performance The SPF is Total heat output per annum Total electricity consumed per annum in other words the average heating COP over the year Window mounted heat pump edit Saddle-style window mounted heat pump D sketch Window mounted heat pumps run on standard v AC outlets and provide heating cooling and humidity control They are more efficient with lower noise levels condensation management and a smaller footprint than window mounted air conditioners that just do cooling Water heating edit In water heating applications heat pumps may be used to heat or preheat water for swimming pools homes or industry Usually heat is extracted from outdoor air and transferred to an indoor water tank District heating edit Large megawatt-scale heat pumps are used for district heating However as of update about of district heat is from fossil fuels In Europe heat pumps account for a mere of heat supply in district heating networks but several countries have targets to decarbonise their networks between and Possible sources of heat for such applications are sewage water ambient water e g sea lake and river water industrial waste heat geothermal energy flue gas waste heat from district cooling and heat from solar seasonal thermal energy storage Large-scale heat pumps for district heating combined with thermal energy storage offer high flexibility for the integration of variable renewable energy Therefore they are regarded as a key technology for limiting climate change by phasing out fossil fuels They are also a crucial element of systems which can both heat and cool districts Industrial heating edit There is great potential to reduce the energy consumption and related greenhouse gas emissions in industry by application of industrial heat pumps for example for process heat Short payback periods of less than years are possible while achieving a high reduction of CO emissions in some cases more than Industrial heat pumps can heat up to C and can meet the heating demands of many light industries In Europe alone GW of heat pumps could be installed in facilities in the paper food and chemicals industries Performance edit Main article Coefficient of performance The performance of a heat pump is determined by the ability of the pump to extract heat from a low temperature environment the source and deliver it to a higher temperature environment the sink Performance varies depending on installation details temperature differences site elevation location on site pipe runs flow rates and maintenance Heat pumps operate at their highest efficiency when the temperature difference between the heat source and the heat sink is minimal As a result they perform best in moderate climates and lose efficiency as outdoor temperatures drop Consumer performance ratings are designed to reflect these variations under different conditions Common performance metrics are the SEER in cooling mode and seasonal coefficient of performance SCOP commonly used just for heating although SCOP can be used for both modes of operation Larger values of either metric indicate better performance When comparing the performance of heat pumps the term performance is preferred to efficiency with coefficient of performance COP being used to describe the ratio of useful heat movement per work input An electrical resistance heater has a COP of which is considerably lower than a well-designed heat pump which will typically have a COP of to with an external temperature of C and an internal temperature of C Because the ground is a constant temperature source a ground-source heat pump is not subjected to large temperature fluctuations and therefore is the most energy-efficient type of heat pump The seasonal coefficient of performance SCOP is a measure of the aggregate energy efficiency measure over a period of one year which is dependent on regional climate One framework for this calculation is given by the Commission Regulation EU No A heat pump s operating performance in cooling mode is characterized in the US by either its energy efficiency ratio EER or seasonal energy efficiency ratio SEER both of which have units of BTU h W note that BTU h W W W and larger values indicate better performance COP variation

pumps depends on their individual efficiency and how electricity is produced An increasing share of low-carbon energy sources such as wind and solar will lower the impact on the climate heating system emissions of energy source efficiency resulting emissions for thermal energy heat pump with onshore wind power gCO kWh COP gCO kWh heat pump with global electricity mixture gCO kWh COP gCO kWh natural-gas thermal high efficiency gCO kWh citation needed gCO kWh heat pump electricity by lignite old power plant and low performance gCO kWh COP gCO kWh In most settings heat pumps will reduce CO emissions compared to heating systems powered by fossil fuels In regions accounting for of world energy consumption the emissions savings of heat pumps compared with a high-efficiency gas boiler are on average above and reach in countries with cleaner electricity mixtures These values can be improved by percentage points respectively with alternative refrigerants In the United States of houses could reduce emissions by installing a heat pump The rising share of renewable electricity generation in many countries is set to increase the emissions savings from heat pumps over time Heating systems powered by green hydrogen are also low-carbon and may become competitors but are much less efficient due to the energy loss associated with hydrogen conversion transport and use In addition not enough green hydrogen is expected to be available before the s or s Operation edit See also Vapor-compression refrigeration This section needs additional citations for verification Please help

diagram of the vapor-compression cycle An internal view of the outdoor unit of an Ecodan air source heat pump Large heat pump setup for a commercial building Wiring and connections to a central air unit inside Vapor-compression uses a circulating refrigerant as the medium which absorbs heat from one space compresses it thereby increasing its temperature before releasing it in another space The system normally has eight main components a compressor a reservoir a reversing valve which selects between heating and cooling mode two thermal expansion valves one used when in heating mode and the other when used in cooling mode and two heat exchangers one associated with the external heat source sink and the other with the interior In heating mode the external heat exchanger is the evaporator and the internal one being the condenser in cooling mode the roles are reversed Circulating refrigerant enters the compressor in the thermodynamic state known as a saturated vapor and is compressed to a higher pressure resulting in a higher temperature as well The hot compressed vapor is then in the thermodynamic state known as a superheated vapor and it is at a temperature and pressure at which it can be condensed with either cooling water or cooling air flowing across the coil or tubes In heating mode this heat is used to heat the building using the internal heat exchanger and in cooling mode this heat is rejected via the external heat exchanger The condensed liquid refrigerant in the thermodynamic state known as a saturated liquid is next routed through an expansion valve where it undergoes an abrupt reduction in pressure That pressure reduction results in the adiabatic flash evaporation of a part of the liquid refrigerant The auto-refrigeration effect of the adiabatic flash evaporation lowers the temperature of the liquid and-vapor refrigerant mixture to where it is colder than the temperature of the enclosed space to be refrigerated The cold mixture is then routed through the coil or tubes in the evaporator A fan circulates the warm air in the enclosed space across the coil or tubes carrying the cold refrigerant liquid and vapor mixture That warm air evaporates the liquid part of the cold refrigerant mixture At the same time the circulating air is cooled and thus lowers the temperature of the enclosed space to the desired temperature The evaporator is where the circulating refrigerant absorbs and removes heat which is subsequently rejected in the condenser and transferred elsewhere by the water or air used in the condenser To complete the refrigeration cycle the refrigerant vapor from the evaporator is again a saturated vapor and is routed back into the compressor Over time the evaporator may collect ice or water from ambient humidity The ice is melted through defrosting cycle An internal heat exchanger is either used to heat cool the interior air directly or to heat water that is then circulated through radiators or underfloor heating circuit to either heat or cool the buildings Improvement of coefficient of performance by subcooling edit Main article Subcooling Heat input can be improved if the refrigerant enters the evaporator with a lower vapor content This can be achieved by cooling the liquid refrigerant after condensation The gaseous refrigerant condenses on the heat exchange surface of the condenser To achieve a heat flow from the gaseous flow center to the wall of the condenser the temperature of the liquid refrigerant must be lower than the condensation temperature Additional subcooling can be achieved by heat exchange between relatively warm liquid refrigerant leaving the condenser and the cooler refrigerant vapor emerging from the evaporator The enthalpy difference required for the subcooling leads to the superheating of the vapor drawn into the compressor When the increase in cooling achieved by subcooling is greater that the compressor drive input required to overcome the additional pressure losses such a heat exchange improves the coefficient of performance One disadvantage of the subcooling of liquids is that the difference between the condensing temperature and the heat-sink temperature must be larger This leads to a moderately high pressure difference between condensing and evaporating pressure whereby the compressor energy increases citation needed Refrigerant choice edit Main article Refrigerant Pure refrigerants can be divided into organic substances hydrocarbons HCs chlorofluorocarbons CFCs hydrochlorofluorocarbons HCFCs hydrofluorocarbons HFCs hydrofluoroolefins HFOs and HCFOs and inorganic substances ammonia NH carbon dioxide CO and water H O Their boiling points are usually below C In the past years the standards and requirements for new refrigerants have changed Nowadays low global warming potential GWP is required in addition to all the previous requirements for safety practicality material compatibility appropriate atmospheric life clarification needed and compatibility with high-efficiency products By devices using refrigerants with a very low GWP still have a small market share but are expected to play an increasing role due to enforced regulations as most countries have now ratified the Kigali Amendment to ban HFCs Isobutane R A and propane R are far less harmful to the environment than conventional hydrofluorocarbons HFC and are already being used in air-source heat pumps Propane may be the most suitable for high temperature heat pumps Ammonia R and carbon dioxide R- also have a low GWP As of update smaller CO heat pumps are not widely available and research and development of them continues A report said that refrigerants with GWP are vulnerable to further international restrictions Until the s heat pumps along with fridges and other related products used chlorofluorocarbons CFCs as refrigerants which caused major damage to the ozone layer when released into the atmosphere Use of these chemicals was banned or severely restricted by the Montreal Protocol of August Replacements including R- a and R- A are hydrofluorocarbons HFC with similar thermodynamic properties with insignificant ozone depletion potential ODP but had problematic GWP HFCs are powerful greenhouse gases which contribute to climate change Dimethyl ether DME also gained in popularity as a refrigerant in combination with R a More recent refrigerants include difluoromethane R with a lower GWP but still over refrigerant -year GWP -year GWP R- propane R- a isobutane R- R- a R- a R- a Devices with R- refrigerant propane are expected to play a key role in the future The -year GWP of propane at is extremely low and is approximately times less than R- However the flammability of propane requires additional safety measures the maximum safe charges have been set significantly lower than for lower flammability refrigerants only allowing approximately times less refrigerant in the system than R- This means that R- is not suitable for all situations or locations Nonetheless by an increasing number of devices with R- were offered for domestic use especially in Europe citation needed At the same time when HFC refrigerants still dominate the market Recent government mandates have seen the phase-out of R- refrigerant Replacements such as R- and R- A are being promoted as environmentally friendly but still have a high GWP A heat pump typically uses kg of refrigerant With R- this amount still has a -year impact equivalent to tons of CO which corresponds to two years of natural gas heating in an average household Refrigerants with a high ODP have already been phased out citation needed Government incentives edit Financial incentives aim to protect consumers from high fossil gas costs and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and are currently available in more than countries around the world covering more than of global heating demand in Australia edit Food processors brewers petfood producers and other industrial energy users are exploring whether it is feasible to use renewable energy to produce industrial-grade heat Process heating accounts for the largest share of onsite energy use in Australian manufacturing with

Renewable Energy Agency ARENA provided funding to the Australian Alliance for Energy Productivity A EP to undertake pre-feasibility studies at a range of sites around Australia with the most promising locations advancing to full feasibility studies In an effort to incentivize energy efficiency and reduce environmental impact the Australian states of Victoria New South Wales and Queensland have implemented rebate programs targeting the upgrade of existing hot water systems These programs specifically encourage the transition from traditional gas or electric systems to heat pump based systems Canada edit In the Canada Greener Homes Grant provides up to for upgrades including certain heat pumps and for energy efficiency evaluations China edit Purchase subsidies in rural areas in the s reduced burning coal for heating which had been causing ill health In the report by the International Energy Agency IEA titled The Future of Heat Pumps in China it is highlighted that China as the world s largest market for heat pumps in buildings plays a critical role in the global industry The country accounts for over one-quarter of global sales with a increase in alone despite a global sales dip of the same year Heat pumps are now used in approximately of all heating equipment sales for buildings in China as of and they are increasingly becoming the norm in central and southern regions for both heating and cooling Despite their higher upfront costs and relatively low awareness heat pumps are favored for their energy efficiency consuming three to five times less energy than electric heaters or fossil fuel-based solutions Currently decentralized heat pumps installed in Chinese buildings represent a quarter of the global installed capacity with a total capacity exceeding GW which covers around of the heating needs in buildings Under the Announced Pledges Scenario APS which aligns with China s carbon neutrality goals the capacity is expected to reach GW by meeting of heating needs This scenario would require an installation of about GW of heat pumps annually until Furthermore the heat pump sector in China employs over people with employment numbers expected to double by underscoring the importance of vocational training for industry growth This robust development in the heat pump market is set to play a significant role in reducing direct emissions in buildings by and cutting PM emissions from residential heating by nearly by European Union edit To speed up the deployment rate of heat pumps the European Commission launched the Heat Pump Accelerator Platform in November It will encourage industry experts policymakers and stakeholders to collaborate share best practices and ideas and jointly discuss measures that promote sustainable heating solutions United Kingdom edit Until fixed heat pumps have no Value Added Tax VAT As of update the installation cost of a heat pump is more than a gas boiler but with the Boiler Upgrade Scheme government grant and assuming electricity gas costs remain similar their lifetime costs would be similar on average However lifetime cost relative to a gas boiler varies considerably depending on several factors such as the quality of the heat pump installation and the tariff used In England was criticised for still allowing new homes to be built with gas boilers unlike some other counties where this is banned United States edit Further information Environmental policy of the Joe Biden administration and Climate change in the United States This section needs to be updated The reason given is talks about in future tense Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information January The High-efficiency Electric Home Rebate Program was created in to award grants to State energy offices and Indian Tribes in order to establish state-wide high-efficiency electric-home rebates Effective immediately American households are eligible for a tax credit to cover the costs of buying and installing a heat pump up to Starting in low- and moderate-level income households will be eligible for a heat-pump rebate of up to In more heat pumps were sold in the United States than natural gas furnaces In November Biden s administration allocated million dollars from the Inflation Reduction Act to speed up production of heat pumps It used the Defense

low-energy house is characterized by an energy-efficient design and technical features which enable it to provide high living standards and comfort with low energy consumption and carbon emissions Traditional heating and active cooling systems are absent or their use is secondary Low-energy buildings may be viewed as examples of sustainable architecture Low-energy houses often have active and passive solar building design and components which reduce the house s energy consumption and minimally impact the resident s lifestyle Throughout the world companies and non-profit organizations provide guidelines and issue certifications to guarantee the energy performance of buildings and their processes and materials Certifications include passive house BBC B timent Basse Consommation Effinergie France zero-carbon house UK and Minergie Switzerland Buildings alone were responsible for of all human Greenhouse gas emissions GHG as of with attributed to residential buildings and to commercial buildings According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change IPCC buildings is the sector which presents the most cost effective opportunities for GHG reductions Background edit During the s research on low-energy buildings was done in Denmark Sweden Germany Canada and the United States The implementation of standardized low-energy building concepts has developed differently in each country Canada edit In the late s the province of Saskatchewan contracted the Saskatchewan Research Council to design and build a passive solar house suitable for the extreme climate of the Canadian prairies where winter temperatures can drop to negative degrees Celsius - F The project resulted in the construction of the Saskatchewan Conservation House in Regina in by a team led by engineer Harold Orr The project developed a heat recovery air exchanger HRV hot water recovery and a blower-door apparatus to measure building air-tightness techniques that became common in low-energy building in other parts of the world Orr would go on to apply many of those techniques to retro-fitting existing buildings to improve energy efficiency Germany edit Triggered in the s by the first energy crisis and growing environmental awareness energy conservation became increasingly important in Germany In the country s first energy-related building standard was enacted The German Passivhaus Institute introduced the first certified passive house in The annual heating requirement was introduced as an important parameter by the third German Thermal Insulation Ordinance In however there was no clear legal requirement for a low-energy building standard in Germany According to Maria Panagiotidou and Robert J Fuller definitions policies and construction activity of zero-energy buildings must be clear The European Union s Energy Performance Directive requires that beginning in only low-energy buildings may be built United Kingdom edit Changes to national policies have occurred since May in the UK One of the most significant has been the withdrawal of the Code for Sustainable Homes CfSH as a system for assessing and encouraging improvements in the environmental design of dwellings This has abandoned the code s schematic which provided a framework of achievement levels and to which low-energy designers could aspire to meet or surpass Although energy-conservation legislation still exists in the building regulations there is a lack of suitable standards exceeding basic regulations As a result the Passive House Standard may expand its influence and impact on energy-efficient houses United States edit Interest in low-energy buildings has increased in the United States primarily due to rising energy prices decreasing costs for onsite renewable-energy systems and increasing concern about climate change California requires all new residential construction to be zero net energy by Types edit Low-energy houses are broadly defined but are generally known as houses with a lower energy demand than common buildings regulated by the national building code The term low-energy house is used in some countries for a specific type of building A low-energy house is a guideline rarely specified in actual values heat load or space-heating minimum A passive house is a standard with specific recommendations to save heating energy At one end of the spectrum are buildings with an ultra-low space-heating requirement which require low levels of imported energy even in winter approaching an autonomous building At the opposite end are buildings where few attempts are made to reduce their space-heating requirement and which use high levels of imported energy in winter Although this may be balanced by high levels of renewable-energy generation throughout the year it imposes greater demands on the national energy infrastructure during winter National standards edit The term low-energy houses may refer to national building standards These standards sometimes seek to limit the energy used for space heating which is the largest energy consumer in many climate zones Other energy uses may also be regulated The history of passive solar building design provides an international view of one form of low-energy-building development and standards Europe edit Standards for low-energy buildings in Europe have proceeded differently in each country and there is no common certification or legislation for low-energy buildings valid in all EU member states As a movement towards reducing energy use and emissions a common legislation concerning buildings energy performance the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive EPBD was published in and became effective in January Norway edit In NS the draft official standard low-energy buildings are defined About the buildings energy performance two alternatives for rating their primary energy use are under discussion A limit on a building s annual CO emissions calculated by multiplying the annual supplied energy by a CO factor A percentage of its heating demand must be met with renewable energy Denmark edit Low-energy houses are defined in the National Building Regulation Building Regulations and are divided into two classes They are regulated in the regulations chapter Low-energy Germany edit Low-energy houses certified by RAL-GZ have percent less heat losses than regulated in the EnEV a national building code Other criteria affect insulation air tightness and ventilation Low-energy buildings may be certified by RAL-GZ for planning or construction Switzerland edit Low-energy buildings may receive the Minergie certification a quality label for new and refurbished buildings The Minergie standard requires that buildings do not exceed percent of average building energy consumption and fossil-fuel consumption must not exceed percent of the average North America edit The European Union directive has clarified low-energy houses in Europe and a large portion of the discussions on zero-energy building in North America derives from the U S National Renewable Energy Laboratory NREL The Energy Star program is the largest certifier of low-energy homes and consumer products in the U S Although certified Energy Star homes use at least percent less energy than standard new homes built in accordance with the International Residential Code they typically achieve a - to -percent savings The United States Department of Energy introduced a program in to distribute zero-energy housing across the country Canadian builders may use a range of standards labels and certification programs to demonstrate a high level of energy performance in a given project These include Net Zero Home and Net Zero Ready Home certifications administered by the Canadian Home Builders Association Built Green labels administered by Built Green Canada Energy Star for Homes administered by Natural Resources Canada The Canadian Passive House standard administered by the Canadian Passive House Institute In British Columbia the above programs align with the BC Energy Step Code a provincial regulation to incentivize or require a level of energy efficiency in new construction beyond the base building code The code was designed as a technical road map to help the province reach its target of all new net-zero-energy-ready buildings by Obstacles and issues edit Energy efficient housing affects indoor air quality Airtight houses will trap pollutants inside them whether produced indoors or outdoors and lead to an increase in human exposure and potential health issues Energy-efficient design often relies on new technologies and techniques These may create technical obstacles in addition to social cultural and economic non-technical obstacles Buildings designed for good energy efficiency do not always live up to the design goals various reasons lead to this performance gap Technology edit Main article List of low-energy building techniques Low-energy building design is considered important to encourage resource efficiency and reduce global climate change associated with the burning of fossil fuels Design involves two general strategies minimizing the need for energy use in buildings especially for heating and cooling through energy-efficient measures EEMs and adopting renewable energy and other technologies RETs to meet remaining energy needs EEMs include building envelopes internal conditions and building-services systems RETs include photovoltaic or building-integrated photovoltaic wind turbines solar thermal solar water heaters heat pumps and district heating and cooling Impacts include life-cycle costs environmental impacts and climate-change and social-policy issues The best low-energy designs offer occupants a better environment and more stable controlled thermal comfort in addition to reduced energy costs GHG emissions associated with buildings construction are mainly coming from Materials manufacturing e g concrete Materials transport Demolition wastes transport Demolition wastes treatment The construction renovation and deconstruction of a typical building is on average responsible for the emissions of kg CO e m around kg CO e m for construction only Strategies adopted by low-carbon buildings to reduce GHG emissions during construction include Reduce quantity of materials used Select materials with low emissions factors associated e g recycled materials Select materials suppliers as close as possible to the construction Divert demolition wastes to recycling instead of landfills or incineration Energy efficiency edit Reduction of energy consumption is more environmentally and financially advantageous than increasing onsite production to reach a low-energy goal The less a home consumes the smaller renewable-energy system it requires to reach net zero Energy efficiency should always be the primary design strategy of a low-energy house Improvements edit Absorption

conditioning Solar hot water Solar devices Passive solar design and landscaping edit See also Sustainable landscaping Sustainable landscape architecture Sustainable gardening Rainwater harvesting and Water conservation Passive solar building design and energy-efficient landscaping support the low-energy house in conservation and can integrate it into a neighborhood and environment Following passive solar building techniques where buildings are compact in shape to reduce surface area and principal windows oriented towards the equator south in the Northern Hemisphere and north in the Southern Hemisphere maximizes passive solar gain However solar gain especially in temperate climates is secondary to minimizing the overall house-energy requirements In hot temperatures excess heat can create uncomfortable indoor conditions Passive alternatives to air-conditioning systems such as temperature-dependent venting have been shown to be effective in regions with cooling needs Other techniques to reduce excess solar heat include brise-soleils trees attached pergolas with vines vertical gardens and green roofs Although low-energy houses can be constructed from dense or lightweight materials internal thermal mass is normally incorporated to reduce summer peak temperatures maintain stable winter temperatures and prevent possible overheating in spring or autumn before the higher sun angle shades midday wall exposure and window penetration Exterior wall color when the surface allows choice reflection or absorption depends on the predominant year-round outdoor temperature The use of deciduous trees and wall trellised or self-attaching vines can assist in temperate climates Lighting and electrical appliances edit See also the categories Energy-saving lighting Lighting Windows Energy conservation and Sustainable energy To minimize total primary energy consumption passive and active daylighting are the first daytime solutions to employ For low-light days non-daylight spaces and nighttime sustainable lighting design with low-energy sources such as standard-voltage compact fluorescent lamps and solid-state lighting with LED lamps OLEDs and polymer light-emitting diodes and low-voltage incandescent light bulbs compact metal halide xenon and halogen lamps can be used Solar-powered exterior security and landscape lighting with solar cells on each fixture or connecting to a central solar panel are available for gardens and outdoor needs Low-voltage systems can be used for more controlled or independent illumination using less electricity than conventional

good Workaholic v t e Microgeneration is the small-scale production of heat or electric power from a low carbon source as an alternative or supplement to traditional centralized grid-connected power Microgeneration technologies include small-scale wind turbines micro hydro solar PV systems microbial fuel cells ground source heat pumps and micro combined heat and power installations These technologies are often combined to form a hybrid power solution that can offer superior performance and lower cost than a system based on one generator History edit In the United States Microgeneration had its roots in the oil crisis and the Yom Kippur War which prompted innovation On June solar panels were installed at the White House The solar cells were dismantled years later during the Reagan administration only to be replaced in the early st century The use of solar water heating dates back before with the first practical solar cell being developed by Bell Labs in The University of Delaware is credited with creating one of the first solar buildings Solar One in The construction ran on a combination of solar thermal and solar photovoltaic power The building didn t use solar panels instead solar was integrated into the rooftop Technologies and set-up edit Power plant edit In addition to the electricity production plant e g wind turbine and solar panel infrastructure for energy storage and power conversion and a hook-up to the regular electricity grid is usually needed and or foreseen Although a hookup to the regular electricity grid is not essential it helps to decrease costs by allowing financial recompensation schemes In the developing world however the start-up cost for this equipment is generally too high thus leaving no choice but to opt for alternative set-ups Extra equipment needed besides the power plant edit A complete PV-solar system The whole of the equipment required to set up a working system and for an off-the-grid generation and or a hook up to the electricity grid herefore is termed a balance of system and is composed of the following parts with PV-systems Energy storage apparatus edit A major issue with off-grid solar and wind systems is that the power is often needed when the sun is not shining or when the wind is calm this is generally not required for purely grid-connected systems a series of deep-cycle stationary or sealed maintenance free batteries the most common solution or other means of energy storage e g hydrogen fuel cells flywheel energy storage pumped-storage hydroelectricity compressed-air tanks a charge controller for charging the batteries or other energy storage For converting DC battery power into AC as required for many appliances or for feeding excess power into a commercial power grid an inverter or grid-interactive inverter The whole is also sometimes referred to as power conditioning equipment Safety equipment edit Groundings transfer switches or isolator switches and surge protectors The whole is also sometimes referred to as safety equipment Usually in microgeneration for homes in the developing world prefabricated house-wiring systems as wiring harnesses or prefabricated distribution units are used instead Simplified house-wiring boxes and cables known as wiring harnesses can simply be bought and mounted into the building without requiring much knowledge about the wiring itself As such even people without technical expertise are able to install them They are also comparatively cheap and offer safety advantages battery meters for charging rate and voltage and meters for power consumption and electricity provision to the regular power grid Small-scale DIY generation system Wind turbine specific edit Main article Small wind turbine With wind turbines hydroelectric plants the extra equipment needed is more or less the same as with PV-systems depending on the type of wind turbine used yet also include a manual disconnect switch foundation for the tower grounding system shutoff and or dummy-load devices for use in high wind when power generated exceeds current needs and storage system capacity Vibro-wind power edit A new wind-energy technology is being developed that converts energy from wind energy vibrations to electricity This energy called Vibro-Wind technology can use winds of less strength than normal wind turbines and can be placed in almost any location A prototype consisted of a panel mounted with oscillators made out of pieces of foam The conversion from mechanical to electrical energy is done using a piezoelectric transducer a device made of a ceramic or polymer that emits electrons when stressed The building of this prototype was led by Francis Moon professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering at Cornell University Moon s work in Vibro-Wind Technology was funded by the Atkinson Center for a Sustainable Future at Cornell Vibro-wind power is not yet commercially viable and in early development stages Significant progress will be needed to commercialize this early stage venture Possible set-ups edit Several microgeneration set-ups are possible These are Off-the-grid set-ups which include Off-the grid set-ups without energy storage e g battery Off-the grid set-ups with energy storage e g battery Battery charging stations Grid-connected set-ups which include Grid connected with backup to power critical loads Grid-connected set-ups without financial recompensation scheme Grid-connected set-ups with net metering Grid connected set-ups with net purchase and sale All set-ups mentioned can work either on a single power plant or a combination of power plants in which case it is called a hybrid power system For safety grid-connected set-ups must automatically switch off or enter an anti-islanding mode when there is a failure of the mains power supply For more about this see the article on the condition of islanding Costs edit Depending on the set-up chosen financial recompensation scheme power plant extra equipment prices may vary According to Practical Action microgeneration at home which uses the latest in cost saving-technology wiring harnesses ready boards cheap DIY-power plants e g DIY wind turbines the household expenditure can be extremely low-cost In fact Practical Action mentions that many households in farming communities in the developing world spend less than on electricity per month However if matters are handled less economically using more commercial systems approaches costs will be dramatically higher In most cases however financial advantage will still be done using microgeneration on renewable power plants often in the range of as local production has no electricity transportation losses on long distance power lines or energy losses from the Joule effect in transformers where in general of the energy is lost In the UK the government offers both grants and feedback payments to help businesses communities and private homes to install these technologies Businesses can write the full cost of installation off against taxable profits whilst homeowners receive a flat-rate grant or payments per kWh of electricity generated and paid back into the national grid Community organizations can also receive up to in grant funding In the UK the Microgeneration Certification Scheme provides approval for Microgeneration Installers and Products which is a mandatory requirement of funding schemes such as the Feed in Tariffs and Renewable Heat Incentive Grid parity edit Grid parity or socket parity occurs when an alternative energy source can generate electricity at a levelized cost of energy LCOE that is less than or equal to the price of purchasing power from the electricity grid Reaching grid parity is considered to be the point at which an energy source becomes a contender for widespread development without subsidies or government support It is widely believed that a wholesale shift in a generation to these forms of energy will take place when they reach grid parity Grid parity has been reached in some locations with on-shore wind power around and with solar power it was achieved for the first time in Spain in Comparison with large-scale generation edit microgeneration large-scale generation notes Other names Distributed generation Centralized generation Economy of scale Necessitates mass production of generators which will create an associated environmental impact Systems are less expensive when produced in quantity Depends on power source generally more economical given the larger scale of the generators Photovoltaics similar panels are used in all applications are affected less by this whilst wind power where power scales approximately as the square of size is affected greatly Ability to meet needs supply within the limits of the installed generation or storage For wind and solar energy the actual production is only a fraction of nameplate capacity Fuel based systems are fully dispatchable Solar panels are simple and reliable they can provide a little electricity at a reasonable cost generally more flexible supply within the limits of local transmission as long as the grid is effectively maintained Environmental impact larger number of smaller devices may lead to greater impact from device production especially with the wind larger generators can have more local impact transmission equipment can also disrupt areas however the overall impact is likely reduced due to economies of scale Commentators claim citation needed that householders who buy their electricity with green energy tariffs can reduce their carbon usage further than with microgeneration and at a lower cost Transmission losses Proximity to end user typically closer resulting in potentially fewer losses Potentially because the lack of scale at each individual installation may lead to use of less efficient transmission technologies A significant proportion of electrical power is lost during transmission approximately in the United Kingdom according to BBC Radio Today programme in March Changes to Grid reduces the transmission load and thus reduces the need for grid upgrades increases the power transmitted and thus increases the need for grid upgrades Grid failure event Electricity may still be available to local area in many circumstances Electricity may be not available due to grid Generator failure event Electricity will not be available except in hybrid scenario Electricity is very likely to be available due to grid redundancy Consumer choices May choose to purchase any legal system May choose to purchase offerings of the power companies depending on market Reliability and maintenance requirements Photovoltaics Stirling engines and certain other systems are usually extremely reliable citation needed and can generate electric power continuously for many thousands of hours with little or no maintenance However unreliable systems will incur additional maintenance labor and costs Managed by power company Grid reliability varies with location Waste Heat by-product Can be used for heating purposes in cold climates thus greatly increasing efficiency and offsetting energy total costs This method is known as micro combined heat and power microCHP Used in some privately owned industrial combined heat and power CHP installations It is also used in large-scale applications where it s called district heating and uses the heat that is normally exhausted by inefficient powerplants Most forms of microgeneration can dynamically balance the supply and demand for electric power by producing more power during periods of high demand and high grid prices and less power during periods of low demand and low grid prices This hybridized grid allows both microgeneration systems and large power plants to operate with greater energy efficiency and cost effectiveness than either could alone Domestic self-sufficiency edit Further information Autonomous building See also Earthship and Off-the-grid Horizontal-Axis Micro-Windmill in Lahore watt rated output Microgeneration can be integrated as part of a self-sufficient house and is typically complemented with other technologies such as domestic food production systems permaculture and agroecosystem rainwater harvesting composting toilets or even complete greywater treatment systems Domestic microgeneration technologies include photovoltaic solar systems small-scale wind turbines micro combined heat and power installations biodiesel and biogas A small Quietrevolution QR Gorlov type vertical-axis wind turbine in Bristol England Measuring m in diameter and m high it has a nameplate rating of kW to the grid Private generation decentralizes the generation of electricity and may also centralize the pooling of surplus energy While they have to be purchased solar shingles and panels are both available Capital cost is high but saves in the long run With appropriate power conversion solar PV panels can run the same electric appliances as electricity from other sources Passive solar water heating is another effective method of utilizing solar power The simplest method is the solar or a black plastic bag Set between and litres and US gal out in the sun and allow to heat Perfect for a quick warm shower The breadbox heater can be constructed easily with recycled materials and basic building experience Consisting of a single or array of black tanks mounted inside a sturdy box insulated on the bottom and sides The lid either horizontal or angled to catch the most sun should be well sealed and of a transparent glazing material glass fiberglass or high temp resistant molded plastic Cold water enters the tank near the bottom heats and rises to the top where it is piped back into the home Ground source heat pumps exploit stable ground temperatures by benefiting from the thermal energy storage capacity of the ground Typically ground source heat pumps have a high initial cost and are difficult to install by the average homeowner They use electric motors to transfer heat from the ground with a high level of efficiency The electricity may come from renewable sources or from external non-renewable sources Fuel edit Biodiesel is an alternative fuel that can power diesel engines and can be used for domestic heating Numerous forms of biomass including soybeans peanuts and algae which has the highest yield can be used to make biodiesel Recycled vegetable oil from restaurants can also be converted into biodiesel Biogas is another alternative fuel created from the waste product of animals Though less practical for most homes a farm environment provides a perfect place to implement the process By mixing the waste and water in a tank with space left for air methane produces naturally in the airspace This methane can be piped out and burned and used for a cookfire Government policy edit Policymakers were accustomed to an energy system based on big centralized projects like nuclear or gas-fired power stations A change of mindsets and incentives are bringing microgeneration into the mainstream Planning regulations may also require streamlining to facilitate the retrofitting of microgenerating facilities onto homes and buildings Most of developed countries including Canada Alberta the United Kingdom Germany Poland Israel and USA have laws allowing microgenerated electricity to be sold into the national grid Alberta Canada edit In January the Government of Alberta s Micro-Generation Regulation came into effect setting rules that allow Albertans to generate their own environmentally friendly electricity and receive credit for any power they send into the electricity grid Poland edit In December the Polish government will vote on a bill which calls for microgeneration as well as large scale wind farms in the Baltic Sea as a solution to cut back on CO emissions from the country s coal plants as well as to reduce Polish dependence on Russian gas Under the terms of the new bill individuals and small businesses which generate up to kW of green energy will receive of market price for any electricity they feed back into the grid and businesses who set up large-scale offshore wind farms in the Baltic will be eligible for subsidization by the state Costs of implementing these new policies will be offset by the creation of a new tax on non-sustainable energy use United States edit The United States has inconsistent energy generation policies across its states State energy policies and laws may vary significantly with location Some states have imposed requirements on utilities that a certain percentage of total power generation be from renewable sources For this purpose renewable sources include wind hydroelectric and solar power whether from large or microgeneration projects Further in some areas transferable renewable source energy credits are needed by power companies to meet these mandates As a result in some portions of the United States power companies will pay a portion of the cost of renewable source microgeneration projects in their service areas These rebates are in addition to any Federal or State renewable-energy income-tax credits that may be applicable In other areas such rebates may differ or may not be available United Kingdom edit The UK Government published its Microgeneration Strategy in March although it was seen as a disappointment by many commentators In contrast the Climate Change and Sustainable Energy Act has been viewed as a positive step To replace earlier schemes the Department of Trade and Industry DTI launched the Low Carbon Buildings Programme in April which provided grants to individuals communities and businesses wishing to invest in microgenerating technologies These schemes have been replaced in turn by new proposals from the Department for Energy and Climate Change DECC for clean energy cashback via Feed-In Tariffs for generating electricity from April and the Renewable Heat Incentive for generating renewable heat from November Feed-In Tariffs are intended to incentivise small-scale less than MW low-carbon electricity generation These feed-in tariffs work alongside the Renewables Obligation RO which will remain the primary mechanism to incentivise deployment of large-scale renewable electricity generation The Renewable Heat Incentive RHI in intended to incentivise the generation of heat from renewable sources They also currently offer up to p per kWh from December in the Tariff for photovoltaics plus another p for the Export Tariff - an overall figure which could see a household earning back double what they currently pay for their electricity On October the government announced a sudden cut in the feed-in tariff from p kWh to p kWh with the new tariff to apply to all new solar PV installations with an eligibility date on or after December Prominent British politicians who have announced they are fitting microgenerating facilities to their homes include the Conservative party leader David Cameron and the Labour Science Minister Malcolm Wicks These plans included small domestic sized wind turbines Cameron before becoming prime minister in the general elections had been asked during an interview on BBC One s The Politics Show on October if he would do the same should he get to Downing Street If they d let me yes he replied In the December Pre-Budget Report the government announced that the sale of surplus electricity from installations designed for personal use would not be subject to Income Tax Legislation to this effect has been included in the Finance Bill In popular culture edit Several movies and TV shows such as The Mosquito Coast Jericho The Time Machine and Beverly Hills Family Robinson have done a great deal in raising interest in microgeneration among the general public Websites such as Instructables and Practical Action propose DIY solutions that can lower the cost of microgeneration thus increasing its popularity Specialized magazines such as OtherPower and Home Power also provide practical advice and guidance See also edit

energy efficiency and thermal comfort that substantially reduces a building s carbon footprint Buildings certified to the standard are ultra-low energy and typically require very little energy for space heating or cooling The approach is used for housing and for non-residential buildings such as offices schools kindergartens and healthcare facilities Energy efficiency is integral to architectural design rather than an add-on Although most common in new construction the principles are also applied in deep renovations see EnerPHit As of January projects certified by the Passive House Institute PHI comprise over units with about million m of treated floor area TFA worldwide the public PHI database lists nearly projects In North America the Passive House Institute US PHIUS reported total certified projects and million ft certified in alone with million ft design-certified that year While early adoption concentrated in German-speaking countries and Scandinavia certified projects are now documented across diverse climate zones including hot-humid and tropical regions History edit Bo Adamson co-originator of the passive house concept Wolfgang Feist co-originator and

t e Passive energy gain edit Passive solar technologies use sunlight without active mechanical systems as contrasted to active solar which uses thermal collectors Such technologies convert sunlight into usable heat in water air and thermal mass cause air-movement for ventilating or future use with little use of other energy sources A common example is a solarium on the equator -side of a building Passive cooling is the use of similar design principles to reduce summer cooling requirements Some passive systems use a small amount of conventional energy to control dampers shutters night insulation and other devices that enhance solar energy collection storage and use and reduce undesirable heat transfer Passive solar technologies include direct and indirect solar gain for space heating solar water heating systems based on the thermosiphon use of thermal mass and phase-change materials for slowing indoor air temperature swings solar cookers the solar chimney for enhancing natural ventilation and earth sheltering More widely solar technologies include the solar furnace but this typically requires some external energy for aligning their concentrating mirrors or receivers and historically have not proven to be practical or cost effective for widespread use Low-grade energy needs such as space and water heating have proven over time to be better applications for passive use of solar energy As a science edit The scientific basis for passive solar building design has been developed from a combination of climatology thermodynamics particularly heat transfer conduction heat convection and electromagnetic radiation fluid mechanics natural convection passive movement of air and water without the use of electricity fans or pumps and human thermal comfort based on heat index psychrometrics and enthalpy control for buildings to be inhabited by humans or animals sunrooms solariums and greenhouses for raising plants Specific attention is divided into the site location and solar orientation of the building local sun path the prevailing level of insolation latitude sunshine clouds precipitation design and construction quality materials placement size type of windows and walls and incorporation of solar-energy-storing thermal mass with heat capacity Elements of passive solar design shown in a direct gain application While these considerations may be directed toward any building achieving an ideal optimized cost performance solution requires careful holistic system integration engineering of these scientific principles Modern refinements through computer modeling such as the comprehensive U S Department of Energy Energy Plus building energy simulation software and application of decades of lessons learned since the s energy crisis can achieve significant energy savings and reduction of environmental damage without sacrificing functionality or aesthetics In fact passive-solar design features such as a greenhouse sunroom solarium can greatly enhance the livability daylight views and value of a home at a low cost per unit of space Much has been learned about passive solar building design since the s energy crisis Many unscientific intuition-based expensive construction experiments have attempted and failed to achieve zero energy the total elimination of heating-and-cooling energy bills Passive solar building construction may not be difficult or expensive using off-the-shelf existing materials and technology but the scientific passive solar building design is a non-trivial engineering effort that requires significant study of previous counter-intuitive lessons learned and time to enter evaluate and iteratively refine the simulation input and output One of the most useful post-construction evaluation tools has been the use of thermography using digital thermal imaging cameras for a formal quantitative scientific energy audit Thermal imaging can be used to document areas of poor thermal performance such as the negative thermal impact of roof-angled glass or a skylight on a cold winter night or hot summer day The scientific lessons learned over the last three decades have been captured in sophisticated comprehensive building energy simulation computer software systems like U S DOE Energy Plus Scientific passive solar building design with quantitative cost benefit product optimization is not easy for a novice The level of complexity has resulted in ongoing bad-architecture and many intuition-based unscientific construction experiments that disappoint their designers and waste a significant portion of their construction budget on inappropriate ideas The economic motivation for scientific design and engineering is significant If it had been applied comprehensively to new building construction beginning in based on s lessons learned The United States could be saving over per year on expensive energy and related pollution today Since Passive Solar Building Design has been a critical element of achieving zero energy by educational institution experiments and governments around the world including the U S Department of Energy and the energy research scientists that they have supported for decades The cost effective proof of concept was established decades ago but cultural change in architecture the construction trades and building-owner decision making has been very slow and difficult The new subjects such as architectural science and architectural technology are being added to some schools of architecture with a future goal of teaching the above scientific and energy-engineering principles citation needed The solar path in passive design edit Solar altitude over a year latitude based on New York New York Main articles Sun path and Position of the Sun The ability to achieve these goals simultaneously is fundamentally dependent on the seasonal variations in the sun s path throughout the day This occurs as a result of the inclination of the Earth s axis of rotation in relation to its orbit The sun path is unique for any given latitude In Northern Hemisphere non-tropical latitudes farther than degrees from the equator The sun will reach its highest point toward the south in the direction of the equator As winter solstice approaches the angle at which the sun rises and sets progressively moves further toward the south and the daylight hours will become shorter The opposite is noted in summer where the sun will rise and set further toward the north and the daylight hours will lengthen The converse is observed in the Southern Hemisphere but the sun rises to the east and sets toward the west regardless of which hemisphere you are in In equatorial regions at less than degrees the position of the sun at solar noon will oscillate from north to south and back again during the year In regions closer than degrees from either north-or-south pole during summer the sun will trace a complete circle in the sky without setting whilst it will never appear above the horizon six months later during the height of winter Seasonal insulation effects of a pergola The -degree difference in the altitude of the sun at solar noon between winter and summer forms the basis of passive solar design This information is combined with local climatic data degree day heating and cooling requirements to determine at what time of the year solar gain will be beneficial for thermal comfort and when it should be blocked with shading By strategic placement of items such as glazing and shading devices the percentage of solar gain entering a building can be controlled throughout the year One passive solar sun path design problem is that although the sun is in the same relative position six weeks before and six weeks after the solstice due to thermal lag from the thermal mass of the Earth the temperature and solar gain requirements are quite different before and after the summer or winter solstice Movable shutters shades shade screens or window quilts can accommodate day-to-day and hour-to-hour solar gain and insulation requirements Careful arrangement of rooms completes the passive solar design A common recommendation for residential dwellings is to place living areas facing solar noon and sleeping quarters on the opposite side A heliodon is a traditional movable light device used by architects and designers to help model sun path effects In modern times D computer graphics can visually simulate this data and calculate performance predictions Passive solar heat transfer principles edit Personal thermal comfort is a function of personal health factors medical psychological sociological and situational ambient air temperature mean radiant temperature air movement wind chill turbulence and relative humidity affecting human evaporative cooling Heat transfer in buildings occurs through convection conduction and thermal radiation through roof walls floor and windows Convective heat transfer edit Convective heat transfer can be beneficial or detrimental Uncontrolled air infiltration from poor weatherization weatherstripping draft-proofing can contribute up to of heat loss during winter however strategic placement of operable windows or vents can enhance convection cross-ventilation and summer cooling when the outside air is of a comfortable temperature and relative humidity Filtered energy recovery ventilation systems may be useful to eliminate undesirable humidity dust pollen and microorganisms in unfiltered ventilation air Natural convection causing rising warm air and falling cooler air can result in an uneven stratification of heat This may cause uncomfortable variations in temperature in the upper and lower conditioned space serve as a method of venting hot air or be designed in as a natural-convection air-flow loop for passive solar heat distribution and temperature equalization Natural human cooling by perspiration and evaporation may be facilitated through natural or forced convective air movement by fans but ceiling fans can disturb the stratified insulating air layers at the top of a room and accelerate heat transfer from a hot attic or through nearby windows In addition high relative humidity inhibits evaporative cooling by humans Radiative heat transfer edit The main source of heat transfer is radiant energy and the primary source is the sun Solar radiation occurs predominantly through the roof and windows but also through walls Thermal radiation moves from a warmer surface to a cooler one Roofs receive the majority of the solar radiation delivered to a house A cool roof or green roof in addition to a radiant barrier can help prevent your attic from becoming hotter than the peak summer outdoor air temperature see albedo absorptivity emissivity and reflectivity Windows are a ready and predictable site for thermal radiation Energy from radiation can move into a window in the day time and out of the same window at night Radiation uses photons to transmit electromagnetic waves through a vacuum or translucent medium Solar heat gain can be significant even on cold clear days Solar heat gain through windows can be reduced by insulated glazing shading and orientation Windows are particularly difficult to insulate compared to roof and walls Convective heat transfer through and around window coverings also degrade its insulation properties When shading windows external shading is more effective at reducing heat gain than internal window coverings Western and eastern sun can provide warmth and lighting but are vulnerable to overheating in summer if not shaded In contrast the low midday sun readily admits light and warmth during the winter but can be easily shaded with appropriate length overhangs or angled louvres during summer and leaf bearing summer shade trees which shed their leaves in the fall The amount of radiant heat received is related to the location latitude altitude cloud cover and seasonal hourly angle of incidence see Sun path and Lambert s cosine law Another passive solar design principle is that thermal energy can be stored in certain building materials and released again when heat gain eases to stabilize diurnal day night temperature variations The complex interaction of thermodynamic principles can be counterintuitive for first-time designers Precise computer modeling can help avoid costly construction experiments Site specific considerations during design edit Latitude sun path and insolation sunshine Seasonal variations in solar gain e g cooling or heating degree days solar insolation humidity Diurnal variations in temperature Micro-climate details related to breezes humidity vegetation and land contour Obstructions Over-shadowing to solar gain or local cross-winds Design elements for residential buildings in temperate climates edit Placement of room-types internal doors and walls and equipment in the house Orienting the building to face the equator or a few degrees to the East to capture the morning sun Extending the building dimension along the east west axis Adequately sizing windows to face the midday sun in the winter and be shaded in the summer Minimising windows on other sides especially western windows Erecting correctly sized latitude-specific roof overhangs or shading elements shrubbery trees trellises fences shutters etc Using the appropriate amount and type of insulation including radiant barriers and bulk insulation to minimise seasonal excessive heat gain or loss Using thermal mass to store excess solar energy during the winter day which is then re-radiated during the night The precise amount of equator-facing glass and thermal mass should be based on careful consideration of latitude altitude climatic conditions and heating cooling degree day requirements Factors that can degrade thermal performance Deviation from ideal orientation and north south east west aspect ratio Excessive glass area over-glazing resulting in overheating also resulting in glare and fading of soft furnishings and heat loss when ambient air temperatures fall Installing glazing where solar gain during the day and thermal losses during the night cannot be controlled easily e g West-facing angled glazing skylights Thermal losses through non-insulated or unprotected glazing Lack of adequate shading during seasonal periods of high solar gain especially on the West wall Incorrect application of thermal mass to modulate daily temperature variations Open staircases leading to unequal distribution of warm air between upper and lower floors as warm air rises High building surface area to volume e g too many corners Inadequate weatherization leading to high air infiltration Lack of or incorrectly installed radiant barriers during the hot season See also cool roof and green roof Insulation materials that are not matched to the main mode of heat transfer e g undesirable convective conductive radiant heat transfer Efficiency and economics of passive solar heating edit Technically PSH is highly efficient Direct-gain systems can utilize i e convert into useful heat of the energy of solar radiation that strikes the aperture or collector Passive solar fraction PSF is the percentage of the required heat load met by PSH and hence represents potential reduction in heating costs RETScreen International has reported a PSF of Within the field of sustainability energy conservation even of the order of is considered substantial Other sources report the following PSFs for modest systems for highly optimized systems Up to for very intense systems In favorable climates such as the southwest United States highly optimized systems can exceed PSF For more information see Solar Air Heat Key passive solar building configurations edit There are three distinct passive solar energy configurations and at least one noteworthy hybrid of these basic configurations direct solar systems indirect solar systems hybrid direct indirect solar systems isolated solar systems Direct solar system edit In a direct-gain passive solar system the indoor space acts as a solar collector heat absorber and distribution system South-facing glass in the northern hemisphere north-facing in the southern hemisphere admits solar energy into the building interior where it directly heats radiant energy absorption or indirectly heats through convection thermal mass in the building such as concrete or masonry floors and walls The floors and walls acting as thermal mass are incorporated as functional parts of the building and temper the intensity of heating during the day At night the heated thermal mass radiates heat into the indoor space In cold climates a sun-tempered building is the most basic type of direct gain passive solar configuration that simply involves increasing slightly the south-facing glazing area without adding additional thermal mass It is a type of direct-gain system in which the building envelope is well insulated is elongated in an east west direction and has a large fraction or more of the windows on the south side It has little added thermal mass beyond what is already in the building i e just framing wall board and so forth In a sun-tempered building the south-facing window area should be limited to about to of the total floor area less in a sunny climate to prevent overheating Additional south-facing glazing can be included only if more thermal mass is added Energy savings are modest with this system and sun tempering is very low cost In genuine direct gain passive solar systems sufficient thermal mass is required to prevent large temperature fluctuations in indoor air more thermal mass is required than in a sun tempered building Overheating of the building interior can result with insufficient or poorly designed thermal mass About one-half to two-thirds of the interior surface area of the floors walls and ceilings must be constructed of thermal storage materials Thermal storage materials can be concrete adobe brick and water Thermal mass in floors and walls should be kept as bare as is functionally and aesthetically possible thermal mass needs to be exposed to direct sunlight Wall-to-wall carpeting large throw rugs expansive furniture and large wall hangings should be avoided Typically for about every ft of south-facing glass about to ft of thermal mass is required for thermal mass m per to m When accounting for minimal-to-average wall and floor coverings and furniture this typically equates to about to ft per ft to m per m of south-facing glass depending upon whether the sunlight strikes the surface directly The simplest rule of thumb is that thermal mass area should have an area of to times the surface area of the direct-gain collector glass area Solid thermal mass e g concrete masonry stone etc should be relatively thin no more than about in mm thick Thermal masses with large exposed areas and those in direct sunlight for at least part of the day hour minimum perform best Medium-to-dark colors with high absorptivity should be used on surfaces of thermal mass elements that will be in direct sunlight Thermal mass that is not in contact with sunlight can be any color Lightweight elements e g drywall walls and ceilings can be any color Covering the glazing with tight-fitting moveable insulation panels during dark cloudy periods and nighttime hours will greatly enhance performance of a direct-gain system Water contained within plastic or metal containment and placed in direct sunlight heats more rapidly and more evenly than solid mass due to natural convection heat transfer The convection process also prevents surface temperatures from becoming too extreme as they sometimes do when dark colored solid mass surfaces receive direct sunlight Depending on climate and with adequate thermal mass south-facing glass area in a direct gain system should be limited to about to of the floor area e g to ft of glass for a ft floor area This should be based on the net glass or glazing area Note that most windows have a net glass glazing area that is to of the overall window unit area Above this level problems with overheating glare and fading of fabrics are likely Indirect solar system edit In an indirect-gain passive solar system the thermal mass concrete masonry or water is located directly behind the south-facing glass and in front of the heated indoor space and so there is no direct heating The position of the mass prevents sunlight from entering the indoor space and can also obstruct the view through the glass There are two types of indirect gain systems thermal storage wall systems and roof pond systems Thermal Storage Trombe Walls edit Main article Trombe wall In a thermal storage wall system often called a Trombe wall a massive wall is located directly behind south-facing glass which absorbs solar energy and releases it selectively towards the building interior at night The wall can be constructed of cast-in-place concrete brick adobe stone or solid or filled concrete masonry units Sunlight enters through the glass and is immediately absorbed at the surface of the mass wall and either stored or conducted through the material mass to the inside space The thermal mass cannot absorb solar energy as fast as it enters the space between the mass and the window area Temperatures of the air in this space can easily exceed F C This hot air can be introduced into interior spaces behind the wall by incorporating heat-distributing vents at the top of the wall This wall system was first envisioned and patented in by its inventor Edward Morse Felix Trombe for whom this system is sometimes named was a French engineer who built several homes using this design in the French Pyrenees in the s A thermal storage wall typically consists of a to in to mm thick masonry wall coated with a dark heat-absorbing finish or a selective surface and covered with a single or double layer of high transmissivity glass The glass is typically placed from in to in from the wall to create a small airspace In some designs the mass is located to ft m away from the glass but the space is still not usable The surface of the thermal mass absorbs the solar radiation that strikes it and stores it for nighttime use Unlike a direct gain system the thermal storage wall system provides passive solar heating without excessive window area and glare in interior spaces However the ability to take advantage of views and daylighting are eliminated The performance of Trombe walls is diminished if the wall interior is not open to the interior spaces Furniture bookshelves and wall cabinets installed on the interior surface of the wall will reduce its performance A classical Trombe wall also generically called a vented thermal storage wall has operable vents near the ceiling and floor levels of the mass wall that allow indoor air to flow through them by natural convection As solar radiation heats the air trapped between the glass and wall and it begins to rise Air is drawn into the lower vent then into the space between the glass and wall to get heated by solar radiation increasing its temperature and causing it to rise and then exit through the top ceiling vent back into the indoor space This allows the wall to directly introduce heated air into the space usually at a temperature of about F C If vents are left open at night or on cloudy days a reversal of convective airflow will occur wasting heat by dissipating it outdoors Vents must be closed at night so radiant heat from the interior surface of the storage wall heats the indoor space Generally vents are also closed during summer months when heat gain is not needed During the summer an exterior exhaust vent installed at the top of the wall can be opened to vent to the outside Such venting makes the system act as a solar chimney driving air through the building during the day Vented thermal storage walls vented to the interior have proven somewhat ineffective mostly because they deliver too much heat during the day in mild weather and during summer months they simply overheat and create comfort issues Most solar experts recommended that thermal storage walls should not be vented to the interior There are many variations of the Trombe wall system An unvented thermal storage wall technically not a Trombe wall captures solar energy on the exterior surface heats up and conducts heat to the interior surface where it radiates from the interior wall surface to the indoor space later in the day A water wall uses a type of thermal mass that consists of tanks or tubes of water used as thermal mass A typical unvented thermal storage wall consists of a south facing masonry or concrete wall with a dark heat-absorbing material on the exterior surface and faced with a single or double layer of glass High transmission glass maximizes solar gains to the mass wall The glass is placed from to in to mm from the wall to create a small airspace Glass framing is typically metal e g aluminum because vinyl will soften and wood will become super dried at the F C temperature that can exist behind the glass in the wall Heat from sunlight passing through the glass is absorbed by the dark surface stored in the wall and conducted slowly inward through the masonry As an architectural detail patterned glass can limit the exterior visibility of the wall without sacrificing solar transmissivity A water wall uses containers of water for thermal mass instead of a solid mass wall Water walls are typically slightly more efficient than solid mass walls because they absorb heat more efficiently due to the development of convective currents in the liquid water as it is heated These currents cause rapid mixing and quicker transfer of heat into the building than can be provided by the solid mass walls Temperature variations between the exterior and interior wall surfaces drive heat through the mass wall Inside the building however daytime heat gain is delayed only becoming available at the interior surface of the thermal mass during the evening when it is needed because the sun has set The time lag is the time difference between when sunlight first strikes the wall and when the heat enters the building interior Time lag is contingent upon the type of material used in the wall and the wall thickness a greater thickness yields a greater time lag The time lag characteristic of thermal mass combined with dampening of temperature fluctuations allows the use of varying daytime solar energy as a more uniform night-time heat source Windows can be placed in the wall for natural lighting or aesthetic reasons but this tends to lower the efficiency somewhat The thickness of a thermal storage wall should be approximately to in to mm for brick to in to mm for concrete to in to mm for earth adobe and at least in mm for water These thicknesses delay movement of heat such that indoor surface temperatures peak during late evening hours Heat will take about to hours to reach the interior of the building heat travels through a concrete wall at rate of about one inch per hour A good thermal connection between the inside wall finishes e g drywall and the thermal mass wall is necessary to maximize heat transfer to the interior space Although the position of a thermal storage wall minimizes daytime overheating of the indoor space a well-insulated building should be limited to approximately to ft of thermal mass wall surface per ft of floor area being heated to m per m of floor area depending upon climate A water wall should have about to ft of water wall surface per ft to m per m of floor area Thermal mass walls are best-suited to sunny winter climates that have high diurnal day-night temperature swings e g southwest mountain-west They do not perform as well in cloudy or extremely cold climates or in climates where there is not a large diurnal temperature swing Nighttime thermal losses through the thermal mass of the wall can still be significant in cloudy and cold climates the wall loses stored heat in less than a day and then leak heat which dramatically raises backup heating requirements Covering the glazing with tight-fitting moveable insulation panels during lengthy cloudy periods and nighttime hours will enhance performance of a thermal storage system The main drawback of thermal storage walls is their heat loss to the outside Double glass glass or any of the plastics is necessary for reducing heat loss in most climates In mild climates single glass is acceptable A selective surface high-absorbing low-emitting surface applied to the exterior surface of the thermal storage wall improves performance by reducing the amount of infrared energy radiated back through the glass typically it achieves a similar improvement in performance without the need for daily installation and removal of insulating panels A selective surface consists of a sheet of metal foil glued to the outside surface of the wall It absorbs almost all the radiation in the visible portion of the solar spectrum and emits very little in the infrared range High absorbency turns the light into heat at the wall s surface and low emittance prevents the heat from radiating back towards the glass Roof Pond System edit A roof pond passive solar system sometimes called a solar roof uses water stored on the roof to temper hot and cold internal temperatures usually in desert environments It typically is constructed of containers holding to in to mm of water on a flat roof Water is stored in large plastic bags or fiberglass containers to maximize radiant emissions and minimize evaporation It can be left unglazed or can be covered by glazing Solar radiation heats the water which acts as a thermal storage medium At night or during cloudy weather the containers can be covered with insulating panels The indoor space below the roof pond is heated by thermal energy emitted by the roof pond storage above These systems require good drainage systems movable insulation and an enhanced structural system to support a to lb ft to kN m dead load With the angles of incidence of sunlight during the day roof ponds are only effective for heating at lower and mid-latitudes in hot to temperate climates Roof pond systems perform better for cooling in hot low humidity climates Not many solar roofs have been built and there is limited information on the design cost performance and construction details of thermal storage roofs Hybrid direct indirect solar system edit Kachadorian demonstrated that the drawbacks of thermal storage walls can be overcome by orienting the Trombe wall horizontally instead of vertically If the thermal storage mass is constructed as a ventilated concrete slab floor instead of as a wall it does not block sunlight from entering the home the Trombe wall s most obvious disadvantage but it can still be exposed to direct sunlight through double-glazed equator-facing windows which can be further insulated by thermal shutters or shades at night The Trombe wall s problematic delay in daytime heat capture is eliminated because heat does not have to be driven through the wall to reach the interior air space some of it reflects or re-radiates immediately from the floor Provided the slab has air channels like the Trombe wall which run through it in the north-south direction and are vented to the interior air space through the concrete slab floor just inside the north and south walls vigorous air thermosiphoning through the slab still occurs as in the vertical Trombe wall distributing the impounded heat throughout the house and cooling the house in summer by the reverse process The ventilated horizontal slab is less expensive to construct than vertical Trombe walls as it forms the foundation of the house which is a necessary expense in any building Slab-on-grade foundations are a common well-understood and cost-effective building component modified only slightly by the inclusion of a layer of concrete-brick air channels rather than an exotic Trombe wall construct The only remaining drawback to this kind of thermal mass solar architecture is the absence of a basement as in any slab-on grade design The Kachadorian floor design is a direct-gain passive solar system but its thermal mass also acts as an indirect heating or cooling element giving up its heat at night It is an alternating cycle hybrid energy system like a hybrid electric vehicle Isolated solar system edit In an isolated gain passive solar system the components e g collector and thermal storage are isolated from the indoor area of the building An attached sunspace also sometimes called a solar room or solarium is a type of isolated gain solar system with a glazed interior space or room that is part of or attached to a building but which can be completely closed off from the main occupied areas It functions like an attached greenhouse that makes use of a combination of direct-gain and indirect-gain system characteristics A sunspace may be called and appear like a greenhouse but a greenhouse is designed to grow plants whereas a sunspace is designed to provide heat and aesthetics to a building Sunspaces are very popular passive design elements because they expand the living areas of a building and offer a room to grow plants and other vegetation In moderate and cold climates however supplemental space heating is required to keep plants from freezing during extremely cold weather An attached sunspace s south-facing glass collects solar energy as in a direct-gain system The simplest sunspace design is to install vertical windows with no overhead glazing Sunspaces may experience high heat gain and high heat loss through their abundance of glazing Although horizontal and sloped glazing collects more heat in the winter it is minimized to prevent overheating during summer months Although overhead glazing can be aesthetically pleasing an insulated roof provides better thermal performance Skylights can be used to provide some daylighting potential Vertical glazing can maximize gain in winter when the angle of the sun is low and yield less heat gain during the summer Vertical glass is less expensive easier to install and insulate and not as prone to leaking fogging breaking and other glass failures A combination of vertical glazing and some sloped glazing is acceptable if summer shading is provided A well-designed overhang may be all that is necessary to shade the glazing in the summer The temperature variations caused by the heat losses and gains can be moderated by thermal mass and low-emissivity windows Thermal mass can include a masonry floor a masonry wall bordering the house or water containers Distribution of heat to the building can be accomplished through ceiling and floor level vents windows doors or fans In a common design thermal mass wall situated on the back of the sunspace adjacent to the living space will function like an indirect-gain thermal mass wall Solar energy entering the sunspace is retained in the thermal mass Solar heat is conveyed into the building by conduction through the shared mass wall in the rear of the sunspace and by vents like an unvented thermal storage wall or through openings in the wall that permit airflow from the sunspace to the indoor space by convection like a vented thermal storage wall In cold climates double glazing should be used to reduce conductive losses through the glass to the outside Night-time heat loss although significant during winter months is not as essential in the sunspace as with direct gain systems since the sunspace can be closed off from the rest of the building In temperate and cold climates thermally isolating the sunspace from the building at night is important Large glass panels French doors or sliding glass doors between the building and attached sunspace will maintain an open feeling without the heat loss associated with an open space A sunspace with a masonry thermal wall will need approximately ft of thermal mass wall surface per ft of floor area being heated m per m of floor area depending on climate Wall thicknesses should be similar to a thermal storage wall If a water wall is used between the sunspace and living space about ft of thermal mass wall surface per ft of floor area being heated m per m of floor area is appropriate In most climates a ventilation system is required in summer months to prevent overheating Generally vast overhead horizontal and east- and west-facing glass areas should not be used in a sunspace without special precautions for summer overheating such as using heat-reflecting glass and providing summer-shading systems areas The internal surfaces of the thermal mass should be dark in color Movable insulation e g window coverings shades shutters can be used help trap the warm air in the sunspace both after the sun has set and during cloudy weather When closed during extremely hot days window coverings can help keep the sunspace from overheating To maximize comfort and efficiency the non-glass sunspace walls ceiling and foundation should be well insulated The perimeter of the foundation wall or slab should be insulated to the frost line or around the slab perimeter In a temperate or cold climate the east and west walls of the sunspace should be insulated no glass Additional measures edit Measures should be taken to reduce heat loss at night e g window coverings or movable window insulation Heat storage edit The sun doesn t shine all the time Heat storage or thermal mass keeps the building warm when the sun can t heat it In diurnal solar houses the storage is designed for one or a few days The usual method is a custom-constructed thermal mass This includes a Trombe wall a ventilated concrete floor a cistern water wall or roof pond It is also feasible to use the thermal mass of the earth itself either as-is or by incorporation into the structure by banking or using rammed earth as a structural medium In subarctic areas or areas that have long terms without solar gain e g weeks of freezing fog purpose-built thermal mass is very expensive Don Stephens pioneered an experimental technique to use the ground as thermal mass large enough for annualized heat storage His designs run an isolated thermosiphon m under a house and insulate the ground with a m waterproof skirt Insulation edit Main article Building insulation Thermal insulation or superinsulation type placement and amount reduces unwanted leakage of heat Some passive buildings are actually constructed of insulation Special glazing systems and window coverings edit Main articles Insulated glazing and Window covering The effectiveness of direct solar gain systems is significantly enhanced by insulative e g double glazing spectrally selective glazing low-e or movable window insulation window quilts bifold interior insulation shutters shades etc Generally Equator-facing windows should not employ glazing coatings that inhibit solar gain There is extensive use of super-insulated windows in the German Passive House standard Selection of different spectrally selective window coating depends on the ratio of heating versus cooling degree days for the design location Glazing selection edit Equator-facing glass edit The requirement for vertical equator-facing glass is different from the other three sides of a building Reflective window coatings and multiple panes of glass can reduce useful solar gain However direct-gain systems are more dependent on double or triple glazing or even quadruple glazing in higher geographic latitudes to reduce heat loss Indirect-gain and isolated-gain configurations may still be able to function effectively with only single-pane glazing Nevertheless the optimal cost-effective solution is both location and system dependent Roof-angle glass and skylights edit Skylights admit harsh direct overhead sunlight and glare either horizontally a flat roof or pitched at the same angle as the roof slope In some cases horizontal skylights are used with reflectors to increase the intensity of solar radiation and harsh glare depending on the roof angle of incidence When the winter sun is low on the horizon most solar radiation reflects off of roof angled glass the angle of incidence is nearly parallel to roof-angled glass morning and afternoon When the summer sun is high it is nearly perpendicular to roof-angled glass which maximizes solar gain at the wrong time of year and acts like a solar furnace Skylights should be covered and well-insulated to reduce natural convection warm air rising heat loss on cold winter nights and intense solar heat gain during hot spring summer fall days The equator-facing side of a building is south in the northern hemisphere and north in the southern hemisphere Skylights on roofs that face away from the equator provide mostly indirect illumination except for summer days when the sun may rise on the non-equator side of the building at some latitudes Skylights on east-facing roofs provide maximum direct light and solar heat gain in the summer morning West-facing skylights provide afternoon sunlight and heat gain during the hottest part of the day Some skylights have expensive glazing that partially reduces summer solar heat gain while still allowing some visible light transmission However if visible light can pass through it so can some radiant heat gain they are both electromagnetic radiation waves You can partially reduce some of the unwanted roof-angled-glazing summer solar heat gain by installing a skylight in the shade of deciduous leaf-shedding trees or by adding a movable insulated opaque window covering on the inside or outside of the skylight This would eliminate the daylight benefit in the summer If tree limbs hang over a roof they will increase problems with leaves in rain gutters possibly cause roof-damaging ice dams shorten roof life and provide an easier path for pests to enter your attic Leaves and twigs on skylights are unappealing difficult to clean and can increase the glazing breakage risk in wind storms Sawtooth roof glazing with vertical-glass-only can bring some of the passive solar building design benefits into the core of a commercial or industrial building without the need for any roof-angled glass or skylights Skylights provide daylight The only view they provide is essentially straight up in most applications Well-insulated light tubes can bring daylight into northern rooms without using a skylight A passive-solar greenhouse provides abundant daylight for the equator-side of the building Infrared thermography color thermal imaging cameras used in formal energy audits can quickly document the negative thermal impact of roof-angled glass or a skylight on a cold winter night or hot summer day The U S Department of Energy states vertical glazing is the overall best option for sunspaces Roof-angled glass and sidewall glass are not recommended for passive solar sunspaces The U S DOE explains drawbacks to roof-angled glazing Glass and plastic have little structural strength When installed vertically glass or plastic bears its own weight because only a small area the top edge of the glazing is subject to gravity As the glass tilts off the vertical axis however an increased area now the sloped cross-section of the glazing has to bear the force of gravity Glass is also brittle it does not flex much before breaking To counteract this you usually must increase the thickness of the glazing or increase the number of structural supports to hold the glazing Both increase overall cost and the latter will reduce the amount of solar gain into the sunspace Another common problem with sloped glazing is its increased exposure to the weather It is difficult to maintain a good seal on roof-angled glass in intense sunlight Hail sleet snow and wind may cause material failure For occupant safety regulatory agencies usually require sloped glass to be made of safety glass laminated or a combination thereof which reduce solar gain potential Most of the roof-angled glass on the Crowne Plaza Hotel Orlando Airport sunspace was destroyed in a single windstorm Roof-angled glass increases construction cost and can increase insurance premiums Vertical glass is less susceptible to weather damage than roof-angled glass It is difficult to control solar heat gain in a sunspace with sloped glazing during the summer and even during the middle of a mild and sunny winter day Skylights are the antithesis of zero energy building Passive Solar Cooling in climates with an air conditioning requirement Angle of incident radiation edit The amount of solar gain transmitted through glass is also affected by the angle of the incident solar radiation Sunlight striking a single sheet of glass within degrees of perpendicular is mostly transmitted less than is reflected whereas for sunlight striking at degrees from perpendicular over of light is reflected and above degrees this percentage reflected rises sharply All of these factors can be modeled more precisely with a photographic light meter and a heliodon or optical bench which can quantify the ratio of reflectivity to transmissivity based on angle of incidence Alternatively passive solar computer software can determine the impact of sun path and cooling-and-heating degree days on energy performance Operable shading and insulation devices edit A design with too much equator-facing glass can result in excessive winter spring or fall day heating uncomfortably bright living spaces at certain times of the year and excessive heat transfer on winter nights and summer days Although the sun is at the same altitude -weeks before and after the solstice the heating and cooling requirements before and after the solstice are significantly different Heat storage on the Earth s surface causes thermal lag Variable cloud cover influences solar gain potential This means that latitude-specific fixed window overhangs while important are not a complete seasonal solar gain control solution Control mechanisms such as manual-or-motorized interior insulated drapes shutters exterior roll-down shade screens or retractable awnings can compensate for differences caused by thermal lag or cloud cover and help control daily hourly solar gain requirement variations Home automation systems that monitor temperature sunlight time of day and room occupancy can precisely control motorized window-shading-and-insulation devices Exterior colors reflecting absorbing edit Materials and colors can be chosen to reflect or absorb solar thermal energy Using information on a color for electromagnetic radiation to determine its thermal radiation properties of reflection or absorption can assist the choices In cold climates with short winter days direct-gain systems utilizing equator-facing windows may actually perform better when snow covers the ground since reflected as well as direct sunlight will enter the house and be captured as heat Landscaping and gardens edit Main article Energy-efficient landscaping Energy-efficient landscaping materials for careful passive solar choices include hardscape building material and softscape plants The use of landscape design principles for selection of trees hedges and trellis - pergola features with vines all can be used to create summer shading For winter solar gain it is desirable to use deciduous plants that drop their leaves in the autumn gives year round passive solar benefits Non-deciduous evergreen shrubs and trees can be windbreaks at variable heights and distances to create protection and shelter from winter wind chill Xeriscaping with mature size appropriate native species of-and drought tolerant plants drip irrigation mulching and organic gardening practices reduce or eliminate the need for energy-and-water-intensive irrigation gas powered garden equipment and reduces the landfill waste footprint Solar powered landscape lighting and fountain pumps and covered swimming pools and plunge pools with solar water heaters can reduce the impact of such amenities Sustainable gardening Sustainable landscaping Sustainable landscape architecture Other passive solar principles edit Passive solar lighting edit Main article Daylighting architecture Passive solar lighting techniques enhance taking advantage of natural illumination for interiors and so reduce reliance on artificial lighting systems This can be achieved by careful building design orientation and placement of window sections to collect light Other creative solutions involve the use of reflecting surfaces to admit daylight into the interior of a building Window sections should be adequately sized and to avoid over-illumination can be shielded with a Brise soleil awnings well placed trees glass coatings and other passive and active devices Another major issue for many window systems is that they can be potentially vulnerable sites of excessive thermal gain or heat loss Whilst high mounted clerestory window and traditional skylights can introduce daylight in poorly oriented sections of a building unwanted heat transfer may be hard to control Thus energy that is saved by reducing artificial lighting is often more than offset by the energy required for operating HVAC systems to maintain thermal comfort Various methods can be employed to address this including but not limited to window coverings insulated glazing and novel materials such as aerogel semi-transparent insulation optical fiber embedded in walls or roof or hybrid solar lighting at Oak Ridge National Laboratory Reflecting elements from active and passive daylighting collectors such as light shelves lighter wall and floor colors mirrored wall sections interior walls with upper glass panels and clear or translucent glassed hinged doors and sliding glass doors take the captured light and passively reflect it further inside The light can be from passive windows or skylights and solar light tubes or from active daylighting sources In traditional Japanese architecture the Sh ji sliding panel doors with translucent Washi screens are an original precedent International style Modernist and Mid-century modern architecture were earlier innovators of this passive penetration and reflection in industrial commercial and residential applications Passive solar water heating edit Main article Solar water heating There are many ways to use solar thermal energy to heat water for domestic use Different active-and-passive solar hot water technologies have different location-specific economic cost benefit analysis implications Fundamental passive solar hot water heating involves no pumps or anything electrical It is very cost effective in climates that do not have lengthy sub-freezing or very-cloudy weather conditions Other active solar water heating technologies etc may be more appropriate for some locations It is possible to have active solar hot water which is also capable of being off grid and qualifies as sustainable This is done by the use of a photovoltaic cell which uses energy from the sun to power the pumps Comparison to the Passive House standard in Europe edit Main article Passive house There is growing momentum in Europe for the approach espoused by the Passive House Passivhaus in German Institute in Germany Rather than relying solely on traditional passive solar design techniques this approach seeks to make use of all passive sources of heat minimises energy usage and emphasises the need for high levels of insulation reinforced by meticulous attention to detail in order to address thermal bridging and cold air infiltration Most of the buildings built to the Passive House standard also incorporate an active heat recovery ventilation unit with or without a small typically kW incorporated heating component The energy design of Passive House buildings is developed using a spreadsheet-based modeling tool called the Passive House Planning Package PHPP which is updated periodically The current version is PHPP A building may be certified as a Passive House when it can be shown that it meets certain criteria the most important being that the annual specific heat demand for the house should not exceed kWh m a Comparison to the Zero heating building edit Main article Zero heating building With advances in ultra low U-value glazing a Passive House-based nearly zero heating building is proposed to supersede the nearly-zero energy buildings in EU The zero heating building reduces on the passive solar design and makes the building more opened to conventional architectural design The annual specific heat demand for the zero-heating house should not exceed kWh m a Zero heating building is simpler to design and to operate For example there is no need for modulated sun shading in zero-heating houses Design tools edit Traditionally a heliodon was used to simulate the altitude and azimuth of the sun shining on a model building at any time of any day of the year In modern times computer programs can model this phenomenon and integrate local climate data including site impacts such as overshadowing and physical obstructions to predict the solar gain potential for a particular building design over the course of a year GPS -based smartphone applications can now do this inexpensively on a hand held device These design tools provide the passive solar designer the ability to evaluate local conditions design elements and orientation prior to construction Energy performance optimization normally requires an iterative-refinement design-and-evaluate process There is no such thing as a one-size-fits-all universal passive solar building design that would work well in all locations Levels of application edit Many detached suburban houses can achieve reductions in heating expense without obvious changes to their appearance comfort or usability This is done using good siting and window positioning small amounts of thermal mass with good-but-conventional insulation weatherization and an occasional supplementary heat source such as a central radiator connected to a solar water heater Sunrays may fall on a wall during the daytime and raise the temperature of its thermal mass This will then radiate heat into the building in the evening External shading or a radiant barrier plus air gap may be used to reduce undesirable summer solar gain An extension of the passive solar approach to seasonal solar capture and storage of heat and cooling These designs attempt to capture warm-season solar heat and convey it to a seasonal thermal store for use months later during the cold season annualised passive solar Increased storage is achieved by employing large amounts of thermal mass or earth coupling Anecdotal reports suggest they can be effective but no formal study has been conducted to demonstrate their superiority The approach also can move cooling into the warm season Examples Passive Annual Heat Storage PAHS by John Hait Annualized Geothermal Solar AGS heating by Don Stephen Earthed-roof A purely passive solar-heated house would have no mechanical furnace unit relying instead on energy captured from sunshine only supplemented by incidental heat energy given off by lights computers and other task-specific appliances such as those for cooking entertainment etc showering people and pets The use of natural convection air currents rather than mechanical devices such as fans to circulate air is related though not strictly solar design Passive solar building design sometimes uses limited electrical and mechanical controls to operate dampers insulating shutters shades awnings or reflectors Some systems enlist small fans or solar-heated chimneys to improve convective air-flow A reasonable way to analyse these systems is by measuring their coefficient of performance A heat pump might use J for every J it delivers giving a COP of A system that only uses a W fan to more-evenly distribute kW of solar heat through an entire house would have a COP of Passive solar building design is often a foundational element of a cost-effective zero energy building Although a ZEB uses multiple passive solar building design concepts a ZEB is usually not purely passive having active mechanical renewable energy generation systems such as wind turbine photovoltaics micro hydro geothermal and other emerging alternative energy sources Passive solar is also a core building design strategy for passive survivability along with other passive strategies Passive solar design on skyscrapers edit There has been recent interest in the utilization of the large amounts of surface area on skyscrapers to improve their overall energy efficiency Because skyscrapers are increasingly ubiquitous in urban environments yet require large amounts of energy to operate there is potential for large amounts of energy savings employing passive solar design techniques One study which analyzed the proposed Bishopsgate tower in London found that a energy decrease in demand can theoretically be achieved through indirect solar gains by rotating the building to achieve optimum ventilation and daylight penetration usage of high thermal mass flooring material to decrease temperature fluctuation inside the building and using double or triple glazed low emissivity window glass for direct solar gain Indirect solar gain techniques included moderating wall heat flow by variations of wall thickness from to cm using window glazing on the outdoor space to prevent heat loss dedicating of floor area for thermal storage and implementing a Trombe wall to absorb heat entering the space Overhangs are used to block direct sunlight in the summer and allow it in the winter and heat reflecting blinds are inserted between the thermal wall and the glazing to limit heat build-up in the summer months Another study analyzed double-green skin facade DGSF on the outside of high-rise buildings in Hong Kong Such a green facade or vegetation covering the outer walls can combat the usage of air conditioning greatly - as much as as discovered by the researchers In more temperate climates strategies such as glazing adjustment of window-to-wall ratio sun shading and roof strategies can offer considerable energy savings in the to range See also

in Germany Sustainable architecture is architecture that seeks to minimize the negative environmental impact of buildings through improved efficiency and moderation in the use of materials energy development space and the ecosystem at large Sometimes sustainable architecture will also focus on the social aspect of sustainability as well Sustainable architecture uses a conscious approach to energy and ecological conservation in the design of the built environment The concept of sustainability or ecological design ensures that the use of current resources does not adversely affect future

t e Shift from narrow to broader approach edit The term sustainability in relation to architecture has so far been mostly considered through the lens of building technology and its transformations Going beyond the technical sphere of green design invention and expertise some scholars are starting to position architecture within a much broader cultural framework of the human interrelationship with nature Adopting this framework allows for tracing a rich history of cultural debates about humanity s relationship to nature and the environment from the point of view of different historical and geographical contexts Operational carbon vs embodied carbon edit Global construction accounts for of total global emissions While sustainable architecture and construction standards have traditionally focused on reducing operational carbon emissions there are to date few standards or systems in place to track and reduce embodied carbon While steel and other materials are responsible for large-scale emissions cement alone is responsible for of all emissions Changing pedagogues edit Critics of the reductionism of modernism often noted the abandonment of the teaching of architectural history as a causal factor The fact that a number of the major players in the deviation from modernism were trained at Princeton University s School of Architecture where recourse to history continued to be a part of design training in the s and s was significant The increasing rise of interest in history had a profound impact on architectural education History courses became more typical and regularized With the demand for professors knowledgeable in the history of architecture several PhD programs in schools of architecture arose in order to differentiate themselves from art history PhD programs where architectural historians had previously trained In the US MIT and Cornell were the first created in the mid- s followed by Columbia Berkeley and Princeton Among the founders of new architectural history programs were Bruno Zevi at the Institute for the History of Architecture in Venice Stanford Anderson and Henry Millon at MIT Alexander Tzonis at the Architectural Association Anthony Vidler at Princeton Manfredo Tafuri at the University of Venice Kenneth Frampton at Columbia University and Werner Oechslin and Kurt Forster at ETH Z rich Sustainable energy use edit Main articles Low-energy house and Zero-energy building K sustainable apartments in Windsor Victoria Australia by DesignInc features passive solar design recycled and sustainable materials photovoltaic cells wastewater treatment rainwater collection and solar hot water The passivhaus standard combines a variety of techniques and technologies to achieve ultra-low energy use Following its destruction by a tornado in the town of Greensburg Kansas United States elected to rebuild to highly stringent LEED Platinum environmental standards Shown is the town s new art center which integrates its own solar panels and wind generators for energy self-sufficiency Energy efficiency over the entire life cycle of a building is a primary goal of sustainable architecture Architects use many different passive and active techniques to reduce the energy needs of buildings and increase their ability to capture or generate their own energy To minimize cost and complexity sustainable architecture prioritizes passive systems to take advantage of building location with incorporated architectural elements supplementing with renewable energy sources and then fossil fuel resources only as needed Site analysis can be employed to optimize use of local environmental resources such as daylight and ambient wind for heating and ventilation Energy use very often depends on whether the building is on-grid or off-grid Off-grid buildings do not use energy provided by utility services and instead have their own independent energy production They use on-site electricity storage while on-grid sites feed in excessive electricity back to the grid Heating ventilation and cooling system efficiency edit Numerous passive architectural strategies have been developed over time Examples of such strategies include the arrangement of rooms or the sizing and orientation of windows in a building and the orientation of facades and streets or the ratio between building heights and street widths for urban planning An important and cost-effective element of an efficient heating ventilation and air conditioning HVAC system is a well-insulated building A more efficient building requires less heat generating or dissipating power but may require more ventilation capacity to expel polluted indoor air Significant amounts of energy are flushed out of buildings in the water air and compost streams Off the shelf on-site energy recycling technologies can effectively recapture energy from waste hot water and stale air and transfer that energy into incoming fresh cold water or fresh air Recapture of energy for uses other than gardening from compost leaving buildings requires centralized anaerobic digesters HVAC systems are powered by motors Copper versus other metal conductors helps to improve the electrical energy efficiencies of motors thereby enhancing the sustainability of electrical building components Site and building orientation have some major effects on a building s HVAC efficiency Passive solar building design allows buildings to harness the energy of the sun efficiently without the use of any active solar mechanisms such as photovoltaic cells or solar hot water panels Typically passive solar building designs incorporate materials with high thermal mass that retain heat effectively and strong insulation that works to prevent heat escape Low energy designs also require the use of solar shading by means of awnings blinds or shutters to reduce the solar heat gain in summer and to reduce the need for artificial cooling In addition low energy buildings typically have a very low surface area to volume ratio to minimize heat loss This means that sprawling multi-winged building designs sometimes thought to look more organic are generally avoided in favor of more centralized structures Traditional cold climate buildings such as American colonial saltbox designs provide a good historical model for centralized heat efficiency in a small-scale building Windows are placed to maximize the input of heat-creating light while minimizing the loss of heat through glass a poor insulator In the northern hemisphere this usually involves installing a large number of south-facing windows to collect direct sun and severely restricting the number of north-facing windows Certain window types such as double or triple glazed insulated windows with gas filled spaces and low emissivity low-E coatings provide much better insulation than single-pane glass windows Preventing excess solar gain by means of solar shading devices in the summer months is important to reduce cooling needs Deciduous trees are often planted in front of windows to block excessive sun in summer with their leaves but allow light through in winter when their leaves fall off Louvers or light shelves are installed to allow the sunlight in during the winter when the sun is lower in the sky and keep it out in the summer when the sun is high in the sky They are slatted like shutters and reflect light and radiation to reduce glare on the interior space Advanced louver systems are automated to maximize daylight and monitor the interior temperature by adjusting their tilt Coniferous or evergreen plants are often planted to the north of buildings to shield against cold north winds In colder climates heating systems are a primary focus for sustainable architecture because they are typically one of the largest single energy drains in buildings In warmer climates where cooling is a primary concern passive solar designs can also be very effective Masonry building materials with high thermal mass are very valuable for retaining the cool temperatures of night throughout the day In addition builders often opt for sprawling single story structures in order to maximize surface area and heat loss citation needed Buildings are often designed to capture and channel existing winds particularly the especially cool winds coming from nearby bodies of water Many of these valuable strategies are employed in some way by the traditional architecture of warm regions such as south-western mission buildings In climates with four seasons an integrated energy system will increase in efficiency when the building is well insulated when it is sited to work with the forces of nature when heat is recaptured to be used immediately or stored when the heat plant relying on fossil fuels or electricity is greater than efficient and when renewable energy is used Renewable energy generation edit BedZED Beddington Zero Energy Development the UK s largest and first carbon-neutral eco-community the distinctive roofscape with solar panels and passive ventilation chimneys Solar panels edit Main article Solar PV Active solar devices such as photovoltaic solar panels help to provide sustainable electricity for any use Electrical output of a solar panel is dependent on orientation efficiency latitude and climate solar gain varies even at the same latitude Typical efficiencies for commercially available PV panels range from to The low efficiency of certain photovoltaic panels can significantly affect the payback period of their installation This low efficiency does not mean that solar panels are not a viable energy alternative In Germany for example solar panels are commonly installed in residential home construction Roofs are often angled toward the sun to allow photovoltaic panels to collect at maximum efficiency In the northern hemisphere a true-south facing orientation maximizes yield for solar panels If true-south is not possible solar panels can produce adequate energy if aligned within of south However at higher latitudes winter energy yield will be significantly reduced for non-south orientation To maximize efficiency in winter the collector can be angled above horizontal Latitude To maximize efficiency in summer the angle should be Latitude - However for an annual maximum production the angle of the panel above horizontal should be equal to its latitude Wind turbines edit Main article Wind power The use of undersized wind turbines in energy production in sustainable structures requires the consideration of many factors In considering costs small wind systems are generally more expensive than larger wind turbines relative to the amount of energy they produce For small wind turbines maintenance costs can be a deciding factor at sites with marginal wind-harnessing capabilities At low-wind sites maintenance can consume much of a small wind turbine s revenue Wind turbines begin operating when winds reach mph achieve energy production capacity at speeds of - mph and shut off to avoid damage at speeds exceeding mph The energy potential of a wind turbine is proportional to the square of the length of its blades and to the cube of the speed at which its blades spin Though wind turbines are available that can supplement power for a single building because of these factors the efficiency of the wind turbine depends much upon the wind conditions at the building site For these reasons for wind turbines to be at all efficient they must be installed at locations that are known to receive a constant amount of wind with average wind speeds of more than mph rather than locations that receive wind sporadically A small wind turbine can be installed on a roof Installation issues then include the strength of the roof vibration and the turbulence caused by the roof ledge Small-scale rooftop wind turbines have been known to be able to generate power from to up to of the electricity required of a regular domestic household dwelling Turbines for residential scale use are usually between feet m to feet m in diameter and produce electricity at a rate of watts to watts at their tested wind speed The reliability of wind turbine systems is important to the success of a wind energy project Unanticipated breakdowns can have a significant impact on a project s profitability due to the logistical and practical difficulties of replacing critical components in a wind turbine Uncertainty with the long-term component reliability has a direct impact on the amount of confidence associated with cost of energy COE estimates Solar water heating edit Main article Solar thermal power Solar water heaters also called solar domestic hot water systems can be a cost-effective way to generate hot water for a home They can be used in any climate and the fuel they use sunshine is free There are two types of solar water systems active and passive An active solar collector system can produce about to gallons of hot water per day A passive system will have a lower capacity Active solar water system s efficiency is - while a passive system is - making active solar systems more powerful There are also two types of circulation direct circulation systems and indirect circulation systems Direct circulation systems loop the domestic water through the panels They should not be used in climates with temperatures below freezing Indirect circulation loops glycol or some other fluid through the solar panels and uses a heat exchanger to heat up the domestic water The two most common types of collector panels are flat-plate and evacuated-tube The two work similarly except that evacuated tubes do not convectively lose heat which greatly improves their efficiency more efficient With these higher efficiencies Evacuated-tube solar collectors can also produce higher-temperature space heating and even higher temperatures for absorption cooling systems Electric-resistance water heaters that are common in homes today have an electrical demand around kW h year With the use of solar collectors the energy use is cut in half The up-front cost of installing solar collectors is high but with the annual energy savings payback periods are relatively short Heat pumps edit Air source heat pumps ASHP can be thought of as reversible air conditioners Like an air conditioner an ASHP can take heat from a relatively cool space e g a house at F and dump it into a hot place e g outside at F However unlike an air conditioner the condenser and evaporator of an ASHP can switch roles and absorb heat from the cool outside air and dump it into a warm house Air-source heat pumps are inexpensive relative to other heat pump systems As the efficiency of air-source heat pumps decline when the outdoor temperature is very cold or very hot therefore they are most efficiently used in temperate climates However contrary to earlier expectations they have proven to be also well suited for regions with cold outdoor temperatures such as Scandinavia or Alaska In Norway Finland and Sweden the use of heat pumps has grown strongly over the last two decades in there were heat pumps per inhabitants in these countries with ASHP the dominant heat pump technology Similarly earlier assumptions that ASHP would only work well in fully insulated buildings have proven wrong even old partially insulated buildings can be retrofitted with ASHPs and thereby strongly reduce their energy demand Effects of EAHPs exhaust air heat pumps have also been studied within the aforementioned regions displaying promising results An exhaust air heat pump uses electricity to extract heat from exhaust air leaving a building redirecting it towards DHW domestic hot water space heating and warming supply air In colder countries an EAHP may be able to recover around - times more energy than an air-to-air exchange system A study surrounding projected emission decreases within Sweden s Kymenlaakso region explored the aspect of retrofitting existing apartment buildings of varying ages with EAHP systems Select buildings were chosen in the cities of Kotka and Kouvola their projected carbon emissions decreasing by about tCO and tCO respectively with a - year payoff period It is however important to note that EAHP systems may not produce favourable results if installed in a building exhibiting incompatible exhaust output rates or electricity consumption In this case EAHP systems may increase energy bills without providing reasonable cuts to carbon emissions see EAHP Ground-source or geothermal heat pumps provide an efficient alternative The difference between the two heat pumps is that the ground-source has one of its heat exchangers placed underground usually in a horizontal or vertical arrangement Ground-source takes advantage of the relatively constant mild temperatures underground which means their efficiencies can be much greater than that of an air-source heat pump The in-ground heat exchanger generally needs a considerable amount of area Designers have placed them in an open area next to the building or underneath a parking lot Energy Star ground-source heat pumps can be to more efficient than their air-source counterparts They are also quieter and can also be applied to other functions like domestic hot water heating In terms of initial cost the ground-source heat pump system costs about twice as much as a standard air-source heat pump to be installed However the up-front costs can be more than offset by the decrease in energy costs The reduction in energy costs is especially apparent in areas with typically hot summers and cold winters Other types of heat pumps are water-source and air-earth If the building is located near a body of water the pond or lake could be used as a heat source or sink Air-earth heat pumps circulate the building s air through underground ducts With higher fan power requirements and inefficient heat transfer Air-earth heat pumps are generally not practical for major construction Passive daytime radiative cooling edit Passive daytime radiative cooling harvests the extreme coldness of outer space as a renewable energy source to achieve daytime cooling Being high in solar reflectance to reduce solar heat gain and strong in longwave infrared LWIR thermal radiation heat transfer daytime radiative cooling surfaces can achieve sub-ambient cooling for indoor and outdoor spaces when applied to roofs which can significantly lower energy demand and costs devoted to cooling These cooling surfaces can be applied as sky-facing panels similar to other renewable energy sources like solar energy panels making them for simple integration into architectural design A passive daytime radiative cooling roof application can double the energy savings of a white roof and when applied as a multilayer surface to of a building s roof it can replace of air conditioning used during the hottest hours of daytime Daytime radiative cooling applications for indoor space cooling is growing with an estimated market size of billion in Sustainable building materials edit See also Green building Green building and wood Hempcrete and

reduce pollution particles in the air Vegetative cover or shield over building envelopes also helps in the same Paper which is fabricated or manufactured out of forest wood is supposedly one hundred percent recyclable thus it regenerates and saves almost all the forest wood that it takes during its manufacturing process There is an underutilized potential for systematically storing carbon in the built environment Natural products edit The use of natural building materials for their sustainable qualities is a practice seen in vernacular architecture Regional architectural styles develop over generations utilizing local materials This practice reduces transportation and production emissions Regenerative sources use of waste material and the ability to reuse are sustainable qualities of timber thatching and stone and clay Laminated timber products straw and stone are low carbon construction materials with major potential for scalability Timber products can sequester carbon while stone has a low extraction energy Straw including straw-bale construction sequesters carbon while providing a high level of insulation High thermal performance of natural materials contribute to regulating interior conditions without the use of modern technologies The uses of timber straw and stone in sustainable architecture were the subject of a major exhibit at the UK s Design Museum Recycled materials edit Discarded Dreams Competition entry from by Ralph Spencer Steenblik and Aaron Legendre highlighting recycling items for building Sustainable architecture often incorporates the use of recycled or second hand materials such as reclaimed lumber and recycled copper The reduction in use of new materials creates a corresponding reduction in embodied energy energy used in the production of materials Often sustainable architects attempt to retrofit old structures to serve new needs in order to avoid unnecessary development Architectural salvage and reclaimed materials are used when appropriate When older buildings are demolished frequently any good wood is reclaimed renewed and sold as flooring Any good dimension stone is similarly reclaimed Many other parts are reused as well such as doors windows mantels and hardware thus reducing the consumption of new goods When new materials are employed green designers look for materials that are rapidly replenished such as bamboo which can be harvested for commercial use after only six years of growth sorghum or wheat straw both of which are waste material that can be pressed into panels or cork oak in which only the outer bark is removed for use thus preserving the tree When possible building materials may be gleaned from the site itself for example if a new structure is being constructed in a wooded area wood from the trees which were cut to make room for the building would be re-used as part of the building itself For insulation in building envelopes more experimental materials such as waste sheep s wool alongside other waste fibers originating from textile and agri-industrial operations are being researched for use as well with recent studies suggesting the recycled insulation effective for architectural purposes Lower volatile organic compounds edit Low-impact building materials are used wherever feasible for example insulation may be made from low VOC volatile organic compound -emitting materials such as recycled denim or cellulose insulation rather than the building insulation materials that may contain carcinogenic or toxic materials such as formaldehyde To discourage insect damage these alternate insulation materials may be treated with boric acid Organic or milk-based paints may be used However a common fallacy is that green materials are always better for the health of occupants or the environment Many harmful substances including formaldehyde arsenic and asbestos are naturally occurring and are not without their histories of use with the best of intentions A study of emissions from materials by the State of California has shown that there are some green materials that have substantial emissions whereas some more traditional materials actually were lower emitters Thus the subject of emissions must be carefully investigated before concluding that natural materials are always the healthiest alternatives for occupants and for the Earth Volatile organic compounds VOC can be found in any indoor environment coming from a variety of different sources VOCs have a high vapor pressure and low water solubility and are suspected of causing sick building syndrome type symptoms This is because many VOCs have been known to cause sensory irritation and central nervous system symptoms characteristic to sick building syndrome indoor concentrations of VOCs are higher than in the outdoor atmosphere and when there are many VOCs present they can cause additive and multiplicative effects Green products are usually considered to contain fewer VOCs and be better for human and environmental health A case study conducted by the Department of Civil Architectural and Environmental Engineering at the University of Miami that compared three green products and their non-green counterparts found that even though both the green products and the non-green counterparts both emitted levels of VOCs the amount and intensity of the VOCs emitted from the green products were much safer and comfortable for human exposure Lab-grown organic materials edit Commonly used building materials such as wood require deforestation that is without proper care unsustainable As of October researchers at MIT have made developments on lab-grown Zinnia elegans cells growing into specific characteristics under conditions within their control These characteristics include the shape thickness and stiffness as well as mechanical properties that can mimic wood David N Bengston from the USDA suggests that this alternative would be more efficient than traditional wood harvesting with future developments potentially saving on transportation energy and conserve forests However Bengston notes that this breakthrough would change paradigms and raises new economic and environmental questions such as timber-dependent communities jobs or how conservation would impact wildfires Materials sustainability standards edit Despite the importance of materials to overall building sustainability quantifying and evaluating the sustainability of building materials has proven difficult There is little coherence in the measurement and assessment of materials sustainability attributes resulting in a landscape today that is littered with hundreds of competing inconsistent and often imprecise eco-labels standards and certifications This discord has led both to confusion among consumers and commercial purchasers and to the incorporation of inconsistent sustainability criteria in larger building certification programs such as LEED Various proposals have been made regarding rationalization of the standardization landscape for sustainable building materials Sustainable design and plan edit Building edit Building information modelling edit Building information modelling BIM is used to help enable sustainable design by allowing architects and engineers to integrate and analyze building performance BIM services including conceptual and topographic modelling offer a new channel to green building with successive and immediate availability of internally coherent and trustworthy project information BIM enables designers to quantify the environmental impacts of systems and materials to support the decisions needed to design sustainable buildings Consulting edit A sustainable building consultant may be engaged early in the design process to forecast the sustainability implications of building materials orientation glazing and other physical factors so as to identify a sustainable approach that meets the specific requirements of a project Norms and standards have been formalized by performance-based rating systems e g LEED and Energy Star for homes They define benchmarks to be met and provide metrics and testing to meet those benchmarks It is up to the parties involved in the project to determine the best approach to meet those standards As sustainable building consulting is often associated with cost premium organisations such as Architects Assist aim for equity of access to sustainable and resident design Building placement edit One central and often ignored aspect of sustainable architecture is building placement Although the ideal environmental home or office structure is often envisioned as an isolated place this kind of placement is usually detrimental to the environment First such structures often serve as the unknowing frontlines of suburban sprawl Second they usually increase the energy consumption required for transportation and lead to unnecessary auto emissions Ideally most building should avoid suburban sprawl in favor of the kind of light urban development articulated by the New Urbanist movement Careful mixed use zoning can make commercial residential and light industrial areas more accessible for those traveling by foot bicycle or public transit as proposed in the Principles of Intelligent Urbanism The study of permaculture in its holistic application can also greatly help in proper building placement that minimizes energy consumption and works with the surroundings rather than against them especially in rural and forested zones Water Usage edit Sustainable buildings look for ways to conserve water One strategic water saving design green buildings incorporate are green roofs Green roofs have rooftop vegetation which captures storm drainage water This function not only collects the water for further uses but also serves as a good insulator that can aid in the urban heat island effect Another strategic water efficient design is treating wastewater so it can be reused again Another sustainable design strategy is the use of rainwater harvesting systems such as low-flow fixtures These are widely known in green architecture for reducing water consumption exponentially and supporting long-term resource conservation Urban design edit Sustainable urbanism takes actions beyond sustainable architecture and makes a broader view for sustainability Typical solutions include eco-industrial park EIP and urban agriculture International programs that are being supported include Sustainable Urban Development Network supported by UN-HABITAT and Eco Cities supported by the World Bank Concurrently the recent movements of New Urbanism New Classical architecture and contemporary Traditional architecture promote a sustainable approach towards construction that appreciates and develops smart growth architectural tradition and classical design This in contrast to modernist and globally uniform architecture as well as leaning against solitary housing estates and suburban sprawl Both trends started in the s The Driehaus Architecture Prize is an award that recognizes efforts in New Urbanism and New Classical architecture and is endowed with a prize money twice as high as that of the modernist Pritzker Prize Waste management edit Waste takes the form of spent or useless materials generated from households and businesses construction and demolition processes and manufacturing and agricultural industries These materials are loosely categorized as municipal solid waste construction and demolition C D debris and industrial or agricultural by-products Sustainable architecture focuses on the on-site use of waste management incorporating things such as grey water systems for use on garden beds and composting toilets to reduce sewage These methods when combined with on-site food waste composting and off-site recycling can reduce a house s waste to a small amount of packaging waste See also edit

environmental impact commonly referred to as the triple bottom line as well as a resilient habitat for existing populations The UN Sustainable Development Goal defines as one that is dedicated to achieving green social and economic sustainability facilitating opportunities that prioritize inclusivity as well as maintaining a sustainable economic growth Furthermore the objective is to minimize the inputs of energy water and food and to drastically reduce waste as well as the outputs of heat air pollution including CO methane and water pollution The UN Environment Programme calls out that most cities today are struggling with environmental degradation traffic congestion inadequate urban infrastructure in addition to a lack of basic services such as water supply sanitation and waste management A sustainable city should promote economic growth and meet the basic needs of its inhabitants while creating sustainable living conditions for all Ideally a sustainable city is one that creates an enduring way of life across the four domains of ecology economics politics and culture The European Investment Bank is assisting cities in the development of long-term strategies in fields including renewable transportation energy efficiency sustainable housing education and health care The European Investment Bank has spent more than billion in bettering cities over the last eight years Cities occupy just three percent of the Earth s land but account for - of energy consumption and at least of carbon emissions Thus creating safe resilient and sustainable cities is one of the top priorities of the Sustainable Development Goals Priorities of a sustainable city include the ability to feed itself with a sustainable reliance on the surrounding natural environment and the ability to power itself with renewable sources of energy while creating the smallest conceivable ecological footprint and the lowest quantity of pollution achievable In other words sustainable cities should use renewable energy sources to ensure the city is energy efficient and uses clean energy without creating more pollution Practical methods to create sustainable cities edit Different agricultural systems such as agricultural plots within the city suburbs or centre This reduces the distance food has to travel from field to fork This may be done by either small-scale private farming plots or through larger-scale agriculture e g farmscrapers Renewable energy sources such as wind turbines solar panels or bio-gas created from sewage to reduce and manage pollution Cities provide economies of scale that make such energy sources viable Various methods to reduce the need for air conditioning a massive energy demand such as passive daytime radiative cooling applications planting trees and lightening surface colors natural ventilation systems an increase in water features and green spaces equaling at least of the city s surface A meta-analysis of studies across cities found that street and residential trees can reduce near-ground air temperatures by as much as C with the strongest cooling effects observed in hot dry climates and in urban areas characterized by more open morphologies These measures counter the heat island effect caused by an abundance of tarmac and asphalt which can make urban areas several degrees warmer than surrounding rural areas as much as six degrees Celsius during the evening Showing pockets of urban spaces creating the Heat Island effect with ranging temperatures Improved public transport and an increase in pedestrianization to reduce car emissions This requires a radically different approach to city planning with integrated business industrial and residential zones Roads may be designed to make driving difficult Optimal building density to make public transport viable but avoid the creation of urban heat islands Green roofs alter the surface energy balance and can help mitigate the urban heat island effect Incorporating eco roofs or green roofs in your design will help with air quality climate and water runoff Zero-emission transport Plants growing on building Zero-energy building to reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions using renewable energy sources Sustainable urban drainage systems or SUDS in addition to other systems to reduce and manage waste Energy conservation systems devices Xeriscaping garden and landscape design for water conservation Sustainable transport incorporates five elements fuel economy occupancy electrification pedal power and urbanization Circular economy to combat inefficient resource patterns and ensure a sustainable production and consumption roadmap Increase of cycling infrastructure would increase cycling within cities and reduce the number of cars being driven and in turn reduce car emissions This would also benefit the health of citizens as they would be able to get more exercise through cycling Key performance indicators development and operational management tool providing guidance and M V for city administrators currently monitor and evaluate energy savings in various facilities Sustainable Sites Initiative or SSI voluntary national guidelines and performance benchmarks for sustainable land design construction and maintenance practices Key areas of focus are soil vegetation hydrology materials and human health and well-being Sustainable cities are creating safe spaces for its inhabitants through various means such as There are a few ways sustainable cities are creating safe spaces for its inhabitants One of the first means is decreasing urban sprawl which is creating more opportunities for people to live within the city instead of creating more living farther from the city In sustainable cities this means allowing people to live closer to the workspace which is typically in the city downtown or urban center City officials are seeking new methods to increase density by changing the antiquated attitudes many suburbanites have towards inner-city areas One of the new ways to achieve this is by solutions worked out by the Smart Growth Movement Another method for cities to create safe spaces for inhabitants is by educating residents of cities about the importance and positive impacts of living in a more sustainable city This initiative boost the desire for sustainable developments and pushes people to live in a more sustainable and environmentally-friendly way Recent research proposes that cities can be conceptualized as having an urban genome a coded architecture of service protocols infrastructure and governance rules When analyzed through data integration and artificial intelligence this framework enables predictive adaptive and cross-sector planning toward more sustainable resilient and inclusive urban systems The final method to note is policy and planning changes to meet the unmet demands for urban services Some of these services include water energy transport depending on the city and its needs With regard to methods of emissions counting cities can be challenging as production of goods and services within their territory can be related either to domestic consumption or exports Conversely the citizens also consume imported goods and services To avoid double counting in any emissions calculation it should be made clear where the emissions are to be counted at the site of production or consumption This may be complicated given long production chains in a globalized economy Moreover the embodied energy and consequences of large-scale raw material extraction required for renewable energy systems and electric vehicle batteries are likely to represent its own complications For example local emissions at the site of utilization are likely to be very small but life-cycle emissions can still be significant Architecture edit Buildings provide the infrastructure for a functioning city and allow for many opportunities to demonstrate a commitment to sustainability A commitment to sustainable architecture encompasses all phases of building including the planning building and restructuring Sustainable Site Initiative is used by landscape architects designers engineers architects developers policy-makers and others to align land development and management with innovative sustainable design Eco-industrial park edit The UNIDO United Nation s Industrial Development Organization defines eco-industrial park as a community of businesses located on a common property in which businesses seek to achieve enhanced environmental economic and social performance through collaboration in managing environmental and resource issues This is an industrial symbiosis where companies gain an added benefit by physically exchanging materials energy water and by-products thus enabling sustainable development This collaboration reduces environmental impact while simultaneously improves economic performance of the area The components for building an eco-industrial park include natural systems more efficient use of energy and more efficient material and water flows Industrial parks should be built to fit into their natural settings in order to reduce environmental impacts which can be accomplished through plant design landscaping and choice of materials For instance there is an industrial park in Michigan built by Phoenix Designs that is made almost entirely from recycled materials The landscaping of the building will include native trees grasses and flowers and the landscaping design will also act as climate shelter for the facility In choosing the materials for building an eco-industrial park designers must consider the life-cycle analysis of each medium that goes into the building to assess their true impact on the environment and to ensure that they are using it from one plant to another steam connections from firms to provide heating for homes in the area and using renewable energy such as wind and solar power In terms of material flows the companies in an eco-industrial park may have common waste treatment facilities a means for transporting by-products from one plant to another or anchoring the park around resource recovery companies that are recruited to the location or started from scratch To create more efficient water flows in industrial parks the processed water from one plant can be reused by another plant and the park s infrastructure can include a way to collect and reuse stormwater runoff Examples of methods edit Recycled Park in Rotterdam the Netherlands edit The Recycled Park in Rotterdam the second-largest city in the Netherlands is an initiative introduced by Recycled Island Foundation a Netherlands-based organization focused on recycling littered waste via creating their iconic island-parks among other sustainable projects Rotterdam s Recycled Park is a cluster of floating green hexagonal islands composed of reused litter The group has utilized a system of passive litter traps to collect this litter from the Maas River The park s location upon the Maas River reflects a circular process aimed at creating a more sustainable city On the underside of the recycled park are materials that will support the growth of plants and wildlife indigenous to the area This interest in growing the biodiversity of Rotterdam s natural elements is also reflected in other cities Chicago s Urban Rivers organization is similarly trying to solve this issue by building and growing the Wild Mile of floating parks and forests along the Chicago River with the goal of revegetation Both Urban Rivers and Recycled Island Foundation s interest in improving the area s biodiversity reflects an interest in greening the built urbanism of the surrounding city Rotterdam s Recycled Park may suggest a greater trend in creating floating structures in response to greater climate-change-motivated impacts The Floating Farm in Rotterdam sustainably approaches food production and transport Other floating structures include renewable energy-powered houseboats and luxury residences some meters from the coast The Dutch city of Amsterdam likewise boasts a neighbourhood of artificial floating islands in the suburb of IJburg The idea of expanding both commercial enterprise and residential developments onto the water is oftentimes reflective of the demand to limit land-usage in urban areas This has various wide-reaching environmental impacts reducing the aggregation of the urban heat-island effect the zoning efforts expended on engineering and regulating the floodplain and potentially the capacity of waste-water reservoirs and reduce the demands of the automobility state The Recycled Park is a holistic approach to limiting the expense of waste The employment of greenery has air-purifying effects to reduce pollution Additionally the modular hexagonal design allows reconstruction of each island this space thus also offers environmental sustainability as well as an open space for community-growing and other social opportunities Urban farming edit See also Urban agriculture Urban farming in Lowell Massachusetts Urban farming is the process of growing and distributing food as well as raising animals in and around a city or in urban areas According to the RUAF Foundation urban farming is different from rural agriculture because it is integrated into the urban economic and ecological system urban agriculture is embedded in and interacting with the urban ecosystem Such linkages include the use of urban residents as the key workers use of typical urban resources such as utilizing organic waste as compost or urban wastewater for irrigation direct links with urban consumers direct impacts on urban ecology positive and negative being part of the urban food system competing for land with other urban functions being influenced by urban policies and plans One motivation for urban agriculture in sustainable cities includes saving energy that would be used in food transportation Urban farming infrastructure can include common areas for community gardens or farms as well as common areas for farmers markets in which the food items grown within the city can be sold to the residents of the urban system Tiny forests or miniature forests is a new concept where many trees are grown on a small patch of land These forests are said to grow x faster and x denser with x biodiversity than larger forests Additionally they are organic The ratio of shrub layer sub-tree layer tree layer and canopy layer of the miniature forest along with the percentage of each tree species are planned and fixed before planting so as to promote biodiversity Renewable Energy in Eco Industrial Parks edit Due to the such close proximity of buildings in eco industrial parks renewable energy is a method that would benefit the energy output created in the area Since there are many types of renewable energies it is essential to pick the one that can create the most energy since eco industrial parks are so energy demanding Based on a study done by Process Systems Engineering Center a variety of renewable energies were tested and it was found that biomass energy is able to produce the largest amount of energy output Because some renewable energies like solar and wind are inconsistent or depend on a unchanging source to produce energy biomass was able to be more persistent than other sources Because areas such as eco industrial parks have such a high energy demand putting more effort into being sustainable is crucial to citywide and even worldwide sustainability Eco industrial parks and cities in general account for almost all energy use So cities that use sustainable energy become more adaptable decreasing the risk of worsening climate change effects and creating economic and social issues New Urbanism edit The most clearly defined form of walkable urbanism is known as the Charter of New Urbanism It is an approach for successfully reducing environmental impacts by altering the built environment to create and preserve smart cities that support sustainable transport Residents in compact urban neighbourhoods drive fewer miles and have significantly lower environmental impacts across a range of measures compared with those living in sprawling suburbs The concept of circular flow land use management has also been introduced in Europe to promote sustainable land use patterns that strive for compact cities and a reduction of greenfield land taken by urban sprawl Sustainable architecture a recent movement of New Classical Architecture promotes a sustainable approach towards construction that appreciates and develops smart growth walkability vernacular tradition and classical design This in contrast to modernist and globally uniform architecture and opposes solitary housing estates and suburban sprawl Both trends started in the s Individual buildings LEED edit Main article Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design The Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design LEED Green Building Rating System encourages and accelerates global adoption of sustainable green building and development practices through the creation and implementation of universally understood and accepted tools and performance criteria LEED or Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design is an internationally recognized green building certification system LEED recognizes whole building sustainable design by identifying key areas of excellence including Sustainable Sites Water Efficiency Energy and Atmosphere Materials and Resources Indoor Environmental Quality Locations Linkages Awareness and Education Innovation in Design Regional Priority In order for a building to become LEED certified sustainability needs to be prioritized in design construction and use One example of sustainable design would be including a certified wood like bamboo Bamboo is fast growing and has an incredible replacement rate after being harvested By far the most credits are rewarded for optimizing energy performance This promotes innovative thinking about alternative forms of energy and encourages increased efficiency A new district in Helsinki Finland is being made almost entirely using timber This timber is a form of a Laminated Veneer Lumbar LVL that has high standards of fire resistance The idea is that wood construction has a much smaller CO footprint than concrete and steel construction and thus this project is going to take Finland s timber architecture to new heights of sustainability Sustainable Sites Initiative SSI edit Sustainable Sites Initiative a combined effort of the American Society of Landscape Architects The Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center at The University of Texas at Austin and the United States Botanic Garden is a voluntary national guideline and performance benchmark for sustainable land design construction and maintenance practices The building principles of SSI are to design with nature and culture use a decision-making hierarchy of preservation conservation and regeneration use a system thinking approach provide regenerative systems support a living process use a collaborative and ethical approach maintain integrity in leadership and research and finally foster environmental stewardship All of these help promote solutions to common environmental issues such as greenhouse gases urban climate issues water pollution and waste energy consumption and health and wellbeing of site users The main focus is hydrology soils vegetation materials and human health and well-being In SSI the main goal for hydrology in sites is to protect and restore existing hydrologic functions To design storm water features to be accessible to site users and manage and clean water on site For site design of soil and vegetation many steps can be done during the construction process to help minimize the urban heat island effects and minimize the building heating requirements by using plants Regenerative Architecture edit Regenerative architecture is usually applied to remediate brownfield sites Still it can encompass a broader mindset to help an ecosystem region or site recover during the lifetime of a structure during construction and operation Regenerative architecture tends to require buildings to self-sustain themselves including generating their sources of power and water However it is essential to acknowledge that a structure should only consume what it can recover while also facilitating an area for regeneration This design mindset differs from the term sustainability as it seeks to contribute the most to an environment instead of reducing the most harm an efficiency paradigm This calls for a more holistic engagement with a singular site rather than broad assumptions about a general ecology Regenerative architecture also extends beyond ecological concerns and can encompass improving social value Since brownfields typically reside near or within human settlements regenerative design can enhance human well-being as a site for engagement while also considering ecological needs It is a way of synchronizing stewardship towards recovery and resilience through design while also considering the social and economic dimensions of these problems Regenerative refers to a process that repairs recreates or revitalizes its own sources of energy or air water or any other matter For design this means considering the impacts of products or by-products from Cradle-to-Grave and the cycle of resource consumption throughout these processes A positive-impact building is a regenerative one Examples include producing more energy treated water that the building consumes the ability to provide habitat for lost wildlife and plant species restore the natural hydrology by recharging the groundwater system compost waste and create opportunities for urban agriculture Since these designs are capable of creating sustenance they can be considered more economically viable less dependable and more resilient Converting unused industrial spaces into accessible green parks is a minor change in achieving regeneration like the Phra Pok Klao Sky Park a green park in the congested city of Bangkok and The New York High Line The Regenerative Paradigm edit The Anthropocene era encompasses the detrimental effects on pollution biodiversity and climate that humans have created In the building sector structures have contributed to of carbon emission of water consumption and of waste production worldwide in The term sustainability largely publicized in the Bruntland Report was a vital yardstick for institutions and governments to acknowledge the impact humans have made and generated a stream of thought where ecosystems became considerations in national agendas The design lexicon has expanded over time from issues of ecology habitat energy or pollution to address waste lifecycle community sustainability and climate change with notions of organic or natural design replaced by green environmental sustainable or resilient building Still the definition where sustainable development meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs gears towards harm reduction but offers enough flexibility for regions to develop their own specific guidelines The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change IPCC report made the scientific and public community aware that the sustainable efficiency paradigm is leading towards a degenerative cycle The Anthropocene era calls for action leading toward regeneration to reverse the impacts humans have caused instead of minimizing harm and maximizing efficiency Since regenerative architecture seeks to restore an ecological site it acknowledges that recovery and remediation are ongoing Indigenous peoples and their methods of vernacular architecture have achieved similar perspectives in material sourcing as regenerative architecture and the mindset of Regenerative Architecture includes bridging the human-nature paradox for the scope complexity and diversity of needs for modern structures Principles edit Regenerative Architecture can implement various standards like Life Cycle Assessments and Building Environmental Assessments like LEED however regeneration is an ongoing activity so it becomes contingent on ecological results Regenerative architecture can use existing standards and principles to situate regeneration in a contemporary sustainability context but it should extend beyond these frameworks to quantify various ecological impacts during the life-time of a building Sustainability manifests in various forms of standardization and testing creating frameworks such as Lifecycle Analysis LCA to assess the entire life-end-cycle of materials to industry-specific systems like Building Environmental Assessments BEAs that consider broader areas of building and living performance to simplify integration within industry BEAs reflect specific comprehensive often esoteric LCA principles through a simplified credit-weighing scale encompassing building environments and living performance These areas apply more directly to architecture and are more accessible to decision-makers These frameworks are very helpful in the design and construction phase and regenerative frameworks can help extend these concepts towards future ecological resilience and evolution Considerations include the safety and accountability of material sourcing the reusability of the materials renewable energy and carbon management water impact and social fairness Eco-cities edit Eco-cities are rooted in various urban planning traditions including the early garden city movement initiated by Ebenezer Howard These early efforts sought self-contained green and interconnected communities In the latter th century a broader understanding of ecological systems prompted the need for cities to address their ecological impact both locally and globally Concepts like urban metabolism and McHarg s ecological site planning emerged The term ecocity was coined by Richard Register in the s during the rise of sustainability concerns as outlined in the Brundtland Commission Report Sustainability in urban planning focuses on inter-generational equity environmental protection and more In the s resilience became a key perspective highlighting the importance of ecological and social resilience in cities facing climate change challenges Transportation edit As major focus of the sustainable cities sustainable transportation attempts to reduce a city s reliance and use of greenhouse emitting gases by utilizing eco-friendly urban planning low environmental impact vehicles and residential proximity to create an urban center that has greater environmental responsibility and social equity Poor transportation systems lead to traffic jams and high levels of pollution Due to the significant impact that transportation services have on a city s energy consumption the last decade has seen an increasing emphasis on sustainable transportation by developmental experts Currently transportation systems account for nearly a quarter of the world s energy consumption and carbon dioxide emission A study on urban passenger transport carbon reduction pathways reported that the transport sector contributes about of global carbon emissions and that urban passenger transport is a major contributor The study also noted that in China the rapid increase in vehicle ownership and urban population density has led to an annual rise of about in transportation-related carbon emissions In order to reduce the environmental impact caused by transportation in metropolitan areas sustainable transportation has three widely agreed-upon pillars that it utilizes to create more healthy and productive urban centers The Carbon Trust states that there are three main ways cities can innovate to make transport more sustainable without increasing journey times better land use planning modal shift to encourage people to choose more efficient forms of transport and making existing transport modes more efficient Car free city edit The concept of car free cities or a city with large pedestrian areas is often part of the design of a sustainable city A large part of the carbon footprint of a city is generated by cars so the car free concept is often considered an integral part of the design of a sustainable city Large parts of London city are to be made car-free to allow people to walk and cycle safely following the COVID- lockdown Similarly miles of bike lanes are planned to be opened in Bogot Colombia in addition to the existing -mile network of streets that was recently made to be traffic-free all week New urbanism frees residents of Masdar City UAE from automobiles and makes possible walkable and sustainable communities by integrating daily facilities such as plazas and sidewalks into the neighborhoods Public transit systems like the Group Rapid Transit and the Metro provide direct access to wide areas of Masdar as well as Abu Dhabi s CBD and other parts of the city The COVID- pandemic gave birth to proposals for radical change in the organisation of the city such as the Manifesto for the Reorganisation of the city after COVID published in Barcelona by architecture and urban theorist Massimo Paolini and signed by academics and architects being the elimination of the car one of the key elements Emphasis on proximity edit See also Compact city and Pocket neighbourhood Created by eco-friendly urban planning the concept of urban proximity is an essential element of current and future sustainable transportation systems This requires that cities be built and added onto with appropriate population and landmark density so that destinations are reached with reduced time in transit This reduced time in transit allows for reduced fuel expenditure and also opens the door to alternative means of transportation such as bike riding and walking Furthermore close proximity of residents and major landmarks allows for the creation of efficient public transportation by eliminating long sprawled out routes and reducing commute time This in turn decreases the social cost to residents who choose to live in these cities by allowing them more time with families and friends instead by eliminating part of their commute time Melbourne is leading the way in creating the -minute neighbourhood where biking walking or using public transport can get you to work shops or a government agency within minutes Paris is experimenting with a similar concept in the Rue de Rivoli area where travel time for any destination is capped at minutes Diversity in modes of transportation edit Sustainable transportation emphasizes the use of a diversity of fuel-efficient transportation vehicles in order to reduce greenhouse emissions and diversity fuel demand Due to the increasingly expensive and volatile cost of energy this strategy has become very important because it allows a way for city residents to be less susceptible to varying highs and lows in various energy prices Among the different modes of transportation the use of alternative energy cars and widespread installation of refueling stations has gained increasing importance while the creation of centralized bike and walking paths remains a staple of the sustainable transportation movement Tesla is one of the pioneers in creating electric vehicles which is said to reduce CO footprints of cars More companies globally are developing their own versions of electric cars and public transport to promote sustainable transportation Access to transportation edit In order to maintain the aspect of social responsibility inherent within the concept of sustainable cities implementing sustainable transportation must include access to transportation by all levels of society Due to the fact that car and fuel cost are often too expensive for lower-income urban residents completing this aspect often revolves around efficient and accessible public transportation Social inclusion is a key goal of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal Sustainable Cities and Communities In order to make public transportation more accessible the cost of rides must be affordable and stations must be located no more than walking distance in each part of the city As studies have shown this accessibility creates a great increase in social and productive opportunity for city residents By allowing lower-income residents cheap and available transportation it allows for individuals to seek employment opportunities all over the urban center rather than simply the area in which they live This in turn reduces unemployment and a number of associated social problems such as crime drug use and violence Smart transportation edit In this age of smart cities many smart solutions are being experimented with to regulate transportation and make public transport more efficient Israel is reinventing commute by engaging in a public-private partnership that uses algorithms to route public transport according to needs Using the concept of mobility as a service MaaS the people of Israel are encouraged to put in their destination on a mobile application this data is then processed by the application to reroute transportation according to demands and options of different modes of transportation are suggested to the commuters to choose from This decreases futile trips and helps the government regulate the number of people in a train or a bus at a time especially useful in times of a pandemic like the COVID- pandemic Urban strategic planning edit Although there is not an international policy regarding sustainable cities and there are not established international standards the organization United Cities and Local Governments UCLG is working to establish universal urban strategic guidelines The UCLG is a democratic and decentralized structure that operates in Africa Eurasia Latin America North America Middle East West Asian and a Metropolitan section work to promote a more sustainable society The members of the UCLG committee evaluate urban development strategies and debate these experiences to make the best recommendations Additionally the UCLG accounts for differences in regional and national context All the organizations are making a great effort to promote this concept by media and Internet and in conferences and workshops An International conference was held in Italy at Universit del Salento and Universit degli Studi della Basilicata called Green Urbanism from to October A review emphasized that smart sustainable and green city strategies are often pursued separately and argued for integrated planning frameworks that align technological innovation environmental sustainability and inclusive urban design to build more resilient and equitable cities Development edit Recently when local and national governments and regional bodies such as the European Union have recognized the need for a holistic understanding of urban planning This is instrumental to establishing an international policy that focuses on cities challenges and the role of the local authorities responses The sustainable development of urban areas is crucial since more than of the world s population lives in cities Cities are in the lead of climate action while being responsible for an estimated of the world s carbon emissions Generally in terms of urban planning the responsibility of local governments are limited to land use and infrastructure provision excluding inclusive urban development strategies The advantages of urban strategic planning include an increase in governance and cooperation that aids local governments in establishing performance based-management clearly identifying the challenges facing local community and more effectively responding on a local level rather than national level and improves institutional responses and local decision making Additionally it increases dialogue between stakeholders and develops consensus-based solutions establishing continuity between sustainability plans and change in local government it places environmental issues as the priority for the sustainable development of cities and serves as a platform to develop concepts and new models of housing energy and mobility Recent research highlights that digital and hybrid participation tools such as online surveys interactive mapping and combined online in-person workshops enhance citizen engagement in urban planning These tools support co-design of urban infrastructure improve inclusivity and allow community input to influence sustainability decisions including green spaces and energy-efficient projects Obstacles edit The City Development Strategies CDS addresses new challenges and provides space for innovative policies that involves all stakeholders The inequality in spatial development and socio-economic classes paired with concerns of poverty reduction and climate change are factors in achieving global sustainable cities as highlighted by the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal According to the UCLG there are differences between regional and national conditions framework and practice that are overcome in the international commitment to communication and negotiation with other governments communities and the private sector to continue to develop through innovative and participatory approaches in strategic decisions building consensus and monitoring performance management and raising investment Social factors of sustainable cities edit According to the United Nations Development Programme UNDP over half of the world s population is concentrated in cities a proportion which is expected to rise to two-thirds by United Cities and Local Governments has specifically identified global challenges to establishing sustainable cities demographic change and migration globalisation of the job market poverty and unmet Millennium Development Goals segregation spatial patterns and urban growth metropolisation and the rise of urban regions more political power for local authorities new actors for developing a city and providing services decline in public funding for development the environment and climate change new and accessible building technologies preparing for uncertainty and limits of growth and global communications and partnerships Social equity edit Gender edit Gender associates an individual with a set of traits and behaviors that are construed to be female and or male by society Gender is a key part of a person s identity which can influence their experiences and opportunities as they navigate through life This is no different for how gender impacts how they navigate through the built environment Men and women experience the built environment differently For over two decades professionals in urban planning have called for the routine consideration of gender relations and gendered experiences in the urban design process Specifically city planners emphasize the need to account for systemic differences in people s lived experiences by gender when designing built environments that are safe and equitable This applies to the development of climate resilient cities Women represent of people who ve been displaced by the climate crisis Women are more vulnerable to the impacts of climate change because of the roles they are socially assigned by gender For instance women are primarily responsible for food provision in the household Unprecedented patterns in the frequency and magnitude of floods and droughts due to climate change directly impact the caregiving responsibilities of many women causing them to disproportionately suffer from the consequences of these natural disasters The inequitable distribution of the burden of climate change by gender is unjust and can be addressed in the design of sustainable cities Achieving gender equality is not only ethically important but economically smart since supporting female development benefits economic growth Moreover it s socially and economically relevant to design sustainable cities not only for women but by women Notable women spearheading the sustainable city movement include mayors Anne Hidalgo Ada Colau Ballano Claudia Lopez Yvonne Aki-Sawyerr Muriel Bowser Patricia de Lille Helen Fernandez and Clover Moore Other female leaders include Christina Figueres Patricia Espinosa Laurence Tubiana and Hakima El Haite Race and Income edit Mobility or the ability to move go places is essential to daily life Our mobility is primarily determined by the transportation infrastructure that surrounds us Throughout US history mobility and right to place have been regulated through codified social rules of who can go where and how Many of these rules were drawn along racial ethnic and nationalistic lines Discriminatory housing and transit policies like red lining have compounded the oppressive living conditions marginalized racial groups have been subjected to centuries and have limited the socioeconomic opportunities of future generations The legacies of these discriminatory policies are responsible for many environmental injustices we see today Environmental injustice refers to the unequal distribution of risk to environmental threats with vulnerable populations e g people of low- and middle-income LMI and people of color POC experiencing the greatest exposure and least protection Environmental injustice is pervasive and manifests in many ways from contaminated drinking water to mold-infested housing stock One example of environmental injustice is the varying burden of heat exposure on different racial and socioeconomic groups Urban areas often experience higher surface temperatures than less developed regions because the concentrated impermeable surfaces are good at absorbing heat creating the heat-island effect mentioned earlier The risk of adverse health effects caused by the heat island effect is and will be compounded by the increasing frequency in heat waves due to the climate crisis This threat is quite dangerous for vulnerable populations including infants and the elderly who lack access to air conditioning and or tree coverage to cool down This limited adaptive capacity to urban heat is concentrated in LMI and historically segregated neighborhoods Specifically neighborhoods in cities that were historically targeted by redlining and divestment experience higher average land surface temperatures than surrounding areas These differences in surface temperatures embody the legacy of discriminatory housing policies in the US and highlight how historic urban planning practices will interact with the effects of the climate crisis We must create the sustainable cities of the future with these historic practices in mind The heat island effect also exacerbates the impacts of another form of environmental injustice that disproportionately affects minority and low-income groups air pollution Urban infrastructure projects that produce environmental toxins like industrial plants and highways are frequently built near or in LMI and POC communities because of favorable zoning codes cheaper land prices and less political backlash This is not because residents don t care but because they often lack the time resources and connections necessary to prevent such construction In turn pollutant-producing operations disproportionately impact LMI and POC communities harming the health outcomes of these groups A study by the University of Minnesota found that if nitrogen dioxide levels NO a product of the combustion of fossil fuels in non-white communities were reduced to equal those in white communities there would be around fewer deaths from heart disease per year This mortality disparity highlights the health impacts of discriminatory zoning and urban planning policies which disproportionately expose LIM and POC communities to air pollution The disparity also shows how much we have to gain from sustainable transportation reform which eliminates combustion-engine vehicles The inequitable breakdown of exposure to environmental risks by race and income reinforces the understanding that the climate crisis is a social issue and that environmental justice depends upon racial justice There is no one right way to address these issues Proposed solutions include eliminating single-family zoning pricing a minimum proportions of housing units for LMI households and requiring community engagement in future urban planning projects To select the best combination of solutions to create sustainable cities tailored to their environments each city must be designed for all community members by all community members Leaders in the environmental justice movement include Robert Bullard Benjamin Chavis Peggy Shepard Kandi Moseett-White Mustafa Santiago Ali Jamie Margolin Elizabeth Yeampierre LeeAnne Walters and Dana Johnson Examples of cities edit Australia edit Adelaide edit Urban forests edit In Adelaide South Australia a city of million people Premier Mike Rann to launched an urban forest initiative in to plant million native trees and shrubs by on project sites across the metro area The projects range from large habitat restoration projects to local biodiversity projects Thousands of Adelaide citizens have participated in community planting days Sites include parks reserves transport corridors schools water courses and coastline Only trees native to the local area are planted to ensure genetic integrity Premier Rann said the project aimed to beautify and cool the city and make it more liveable improve air and water quality and reduce Adelaide s greenhouse gas emissions by tonnes of CO a year He said it was also about creating and conserving habitat for wildlife and preventing species loss Solar power edit The Rann government also launched an initiative for Adelaide to lead Australia in the take-up of solar power In addition to Australia s first feed-in tariff to stimulate the purchase of solar panels for domestic roofs the government committed millions of dollars to place arrays of solar panels on the roofs

a power station Wind power edit South Australia went from zero wind power in to wind power making up of its electricity generation by October In the five years preceding there was a drop in emissions despite strong economic growth Waste recycling edit For Adelaide the South Australian government also embraced a Zero Waste recycling strategy achieving a recycling rate of nearly by with million tonnes of materials diverted from landfill to recycling On a per capita basis this was the best result in Australia the equivalent of preventing more than a million tonnes of CO entering the atmosphere In the s container-deposit legislation was introduced Consumers are paid a cent rebate on each bottle can or container they return to recycling In non-reusable plastic bags used in supermarket checkouts were banned by the Rann Government preventing million plastic bags per year entering the litter stream In Zero Waste SA was commended by a UN Habitat Report entitled Solid Waste Management in the World Cities Melbourne edit City of Merri-bek The City of Merri-bek in Melbourne s north has programs for becoming carbon neutral one of which is Zero Carbon Merri-bek amongst other

t e A Sustainable habitat is an ecosystem that produces food and shelter for people and other organisms without resource depletion and in such a way that no external waste is produced Thus the habitat can continue into the future tie without external infusions of resources Such a sustainable habitat may evolve naturally or be produced under the influence of man A sustainable habitat that is created and designed by human intelligence will mimic nature if it is to be successful Everything within it is connected to a complex array of organisms physical resources and functions Organisms from many different biomes can be brought together to fulfill various ecological niches Definition edit Sustainable D-printed house - Tecla A sustainable habitat is achieving stability between the economic and social development of human habitats together with the defense of the environment shelter basic services social infrastructure and transportation A sustainable habitat is required to make sure that one species waste ends up being the energy or food source for another species It involves the preservation of the ecological balance in terms of a symbiotic perspective on urban development while developing urban extensions of existing towns The term often refers to sustainable human habitats which typically involves some form of green building or environmental planning History edit In creating the sustainable habitats environmental scientists designers engineers and architects must not consider any elements as a waste product to be disposed of somewhere off site but as a nutrient stream for another process to feed on Researching ways to interconnect waste streams to production creates a more sustainable society by minimizing pollution Sustainability of marine ecosystems is a concern Rigorous fishing has decreased top trophic levels and affected the ecological dynamics and resilience of fisheries by reducing the numbers and lengths of food webs Historically intense commercial and rising recreational fishing pressures have resulted in unsustainable rates of exploitation for of the snapper-grouper complex which consists of over species mainly of groupers and snappers in Florida and the Florida Keys The systematic and widespread conversion of estuarine habitats into agricultural industrial and urban uses has demonstrated a historical devotion to valuing the use of land for purposes from a position of simple but defective logic Unused land provides no products which is useless land The ecosystem services approach fills gaps in a sustainability analysis by demanding the account for the linkages between ecosystem goods and services and ecosystem processes and human wellbeing The World Commission on Environment and Development states that sustaining oceans are marked by a fundamental unity Interconnected cycles of energy climate marine living resources and human activities move through coastal waters regional seas and the closed oceans Global pressures on the ocean include rising levels of greenhouse gas emissions which impact species and food webs throughout ocean ecosystems deoxygenation overfishing and run-off pollution from land and coastal sources Transformation to a thriving ocean system requires changes in governance across sectors and scales The end result would be a form of polycentric governance that can manage shared resources and ocean space A polycentric governance goal from The World Commission on Environment and Development is to support multiple governing bodies by establishing a shared vision and creating principled guiding frameworks and processes to facilitate coherent systems-oriented regulation Types of sustainable habitats edit Coral reefs edit Coral Outcrop Flynn Reef A coral reef is an underwater ecosystem characterized by reef-building corals Coral reefs serve as a habitat for a diverse range of fish and invertebrates while also providing economic resources to fishing communities The coral reefs foundation is made up of stony corals with calcareous skeletons that protect shores from storm surges They also help produce sand for recreational beaches and aquariums Coral reefs are a largely self-sustaining ecosystem and up to of the corals nutrients may come from their symbiotic relationships The coral polyps and microscopic algae zooxanthellae in coral reefs have a symbiotic relationship wherein the algae provide nourishment to the coral polyps from within their tissue Parks edit Beech Forest AU Great Otway National Park Beauchamp Falls Saint Stephen s Green Dublin Ireland A park is a protected area of wildlife It is a natural sustainable habitat Parks promote a culture of wellness that engages members of their surrounding communities and promotes healthy and active lifestyles People who volunteer at parks may support these sustainable habitats and help to maintain them Parks may serve as recreational areas for communities encouraging people to spend time in nature Urban parks are in urban areas creating a natural space that benefits those living in cities Plants and animals may flourish in parks where they are able to have a sustainable habitat away from the interference of humans This is especially true of national parks where land is set aside and preserved These habitats are sustainable in nature Cities edit A sustainable city is a city that is designed and built in an ecologically friendly way Sustainable cities may also be known as eco-cities or green cities These cities are constructed with guidelines about spatial planning and operational rules pertaining to urbanism in mind Spatial planning takes into account ecological social cultural and economic issues and policies This leads to the creation of mindfully built cities that are aware and conscious of their impact on the environment Sustainable cities in earthquake -prone areas are built with input from civil engineers architects and urban planners who collaborate on safe architecture that can withstand disasters This reduces waste and ensures that buildings will last for many years to come In areas that are protected because of nature and cultural heritage this heritage may be reflected in the choice of construction materials and the design of the buildings This helps to preserve culture Additionally construction materials and building orientation may be chosen with the intent to mitigate the effects of climate change Cities may also be planned to include green spaces and trees that reduce heat stress Creating sustainable habitats edit In creating sustainable habitats environmental scientists designers engineers and architects must not consider any elements as a waste product to be disposed of somewhere off-site but as a nutrient stream for another process to feed on Net-Zero Energy Buildings NZEB edit These buildings are made to use the minimum amount of energy possible When these buildings contain renewable sources they are able to produce the specific amount of energy required to function In some cases they can produce more than the energy they need and they will harness this energy Net Zero Water Building Energy positive buildings edit Currently buildings account for almost percent of global carbon emissions Energy-positive buildings produce more energy than the energy they demand this is a demand for most countries that are focused on total carbon emissions Hydro and the Zero Emission Resource Organisation ZERO is a specific company that has created energy-positive buildings in Norway They have an interesting approach that includes embodied energy which means that the total energy with every step of collecting materials and constructing the building For example timber or wood takes less energy to collect cut and construct into something than concrete Whereas recycled material contains the lowest embodied energy This company has engineered its buildings to self-ventilate have maximum daylight and more This is one alternative to building sustainable habitats Sustainable building materials edit Concrete edit Sustainable building materials can change the way we move forward as a society A very common form of building material is concrete However this is not a sustainable resource for building materials because it can crack and degrade over time An alternative to concrete is bacterial concrete self-healing concrete which is a substance that mixes Bacillus pseudofirmus Bacillus cohnii and concrete This mixture can be a sustainable switch because it is a self-healing substance Since concrete can crack from weathering plates shifting and the temperature it is important to consider using something that will last a long time and won t need several repairs This bacteria concrete improves strength reduces water absorption and more Depending on the bacteria used you can have different effects on the overall durability of the concrete For example in a place where chloride is used you can add Sporosarcina pasteuria to increase the overall resistance to the chloride ion that can penetrate the concrete Another example is water absorption in this situation Bacillus sphaericus reduced water absorption The different types of bacteria can assist in the sustainability of the overall structure and length of the substance The cost of adding bacteria can be to times higher in cost than normal concrete self-healing concrete that fixes cracks in concrete Wood edit Wood can be a great resource for building structures because of the longevity of the material However since wood is a natural resource specific protocols need to be followed for using this material in order to be a sustainable building Wood is the most commonly used building material in the United States Wood has a low carbon impact and a low embodied energy This is the amount of energy that is required to harvest and create said building wood The process of environmental planning edit environmental planning Environmental planning can be numerous things including building structures effeminacy and useability A lot of factors go into play for planning something that is sustainable and environmentally friendly while still implementing culture and aspects to improve society One topic why environmental planning is so important is tourism When people visit a new place they spend a lot of money this money goes to the economy of the town with several tourists List of steps for planning edit Create a planning team Make a vision for future Figure out community wants and needs for the environment Find solutions Create a plan Proceed with plan Evaluate steps and fix any issues This list can create a wonderful set of baseline monitoring This is important for sustainable habitats because it is a framework to ensure that the environment will not be negatively impacted by human actions of creating specific things like parks houses community buildings and more Sustainable transportation edit Transportation can be considered an important way that an economy can help society succeed Transportation actually produces of the carbon emissions in the world Also it accounts for of the world s oil use This is a huge percentage of natural resources going into transportation There are solutions that can be implemented to create a sustainable habitat for the communities and economies of the world An example of sustainable public transportation in Jakarta Indonesia which has won the Sustainable Transport Award One way they one this award and implemented sustainability is by connecting local buses vehicles and micro busses within their cities and urban regions The city of Jakarta has created a transportation system called BRT system that had specific lanes just for public transportation This has decreased traffic overall because more people are using the BRT system instead of driving Something else that the BRT transportation system has is that it can take people farther than the individual car can This lowered carbon emissions and oil consumption Jakarta metrotrans bus Green energy edit Green energy is an alternative to using fossil fuels Some examples are solar energy wind energy and nuclear energy These alternatives use natural energy instead of fossil fuels to promote green electricity The use of green energy can boost any economy for example in India it could create a green energy market worth billion by India has created solar parks in the country One of the largest parks in India has a capacity of GW for a solar wind hybrid park All of the parks in India have changed the way the economy works overall They have decreased the amount of money it cost using fossil fuels because they are using natural energy They have also implemented a self-cleaning tool that cleans the solar panels in the solar parks they created Solar panels can get dirty from weathering This tool cleans the top of the solar panel so that the maximum amount of energy is produced Solar Panels HUDA station in India Remedial efforts edit Mauricie National Park Restoration and protection of parks edit The restoration and protection of parks begins with the acknowledgement of the need for actions After a government or state is aware of the need for restoration protection and the creation of these sustainable habitats action takes place The need for funding creates the foundational roadblock in protecting and restoring parks Funding can be received by state legislations and fundraising projects hosted by supporting organizations This funding can then be systematically distributed to encompass movements that make a significant stride towards protecting and restoring parks These movements include but are not limited to setting up fences around parks establishing park security and supplying and resupplying proper nutritional elements to the parks to sustain and promote growth of habitats Ocean Governance edit Ocean Shoreline Drone Shot Ocean Governance is defined as the integrated conduct of the policy actions and affairs regarding the world s oceans to protect ocean environment sustainable use of coastal and marine resources as well as to conserve its biodiversity Ocean governance as a process is recommended to be integrated horizontally and vertically Integrating a process horizontally entails requiring the participation of governmental institutions the private sector NGOs academics and scientists while integrating a process vertically entails essential communication collaboration and coordination between the chosen governmental institutions and other participatory agencies Partnership is an essential aspect of ocean governance as it covers all bases of collective remedial efforts Essentially it connects local and state governments who both want to induce the remedial efforts Communication between inter-governmental agencies and regional institutions aids in strengthening collective efforts that are set into motion Coastal national parks and oceans are facing many threatening changes to their equilibrium These include but are not limited to rising sea levels damaged coral reefs storm activity and erosion At the Timucuan Ecological Historic Preserve and the Cumberland Island National Seashore teams such as the National Park Foundation NPF National Park Services NPS and the Green Team Youth Corps at Groundwork Jacksonville are all making strides to prevent and stabilize eroding shorelines regrowing native marsh grasses and reemerging the once stable habitat that was once known as home for a plethora of marine species Green building edit Green building is a foundationally different mode of building and operating a series of buildings that contrast to those built in the past in their aspects of sustainability The buildings funded for by the Green Building Initiative and the United States Green Building Council enable access to environmentally and socially responsible healthy and prosperous environment s that improve s the quality of life A system by the name of LEED is the world s most widely used green building system with more than buildings participating to date Buildings that are funded by the Green Building Initiative and LEED have been proven to be financially environmentally and efficiently healthier for individuals Lower carbon emissions healthier living spaces and

transit Category Renewable energy portal v t e Sustainable refurbishment describes working on existing buildings to improve their environmental performance using sustainable methods and materials A refurbishment or retrofit is defined as any work to a building over and above maintenance to change its capacity function or performance in other words any intervention to adjust reuse or upgrade a building to suit new conditions or requirements Refurbishment can be done to a part of a building an entire building or a campus Sustainable refurbishment takes this a step further to modify the existing building to perform better in terms of its environmental impact and its occupants environment Most sustainable refurbishments are also green retrofits any refurbishment of an existing building that aims to reduce the carbon emissions and environmental impact of the building This can include improving the energy efficiency of the HVAC and other mechanical systems increasing the quality of insulation in the building envelope implementing sustainable energy generation and aiming to improve occupant comfort and health Green retrofits have become increasingly prominent with their inclusion in a number of building rating systems such as the USGBC s LEED for Existing Buildings Operations Maintenance Passive House EnerPHit and Green Globes for Existing Buildings Some governments offer funding towards green retrofits as existing buildings make up a majority of operational buildings and have been identified as a growing area of consideration in the fight against climate change Overview edit Sustainable refurbishment is the equivalent of sustainable development which relates to new developments of cities buildings or industries etc Sustainable refurbishment includes insulation and related measures to reduce the energy consumption of buildings installation of renewable energy sources such as solar water heating and photovoltaics measures to reduce water consumption and changes to reduce over heating improve ventilation and improve internal comfort The process of sustainable refurbishment includes minimizing the waste of existing components recycling and using environmentally friendly materials and minimizing energy use noise and waste during the refurbishment The importance of sustainable refurbishment is that the majority of buildings in use are not new and thus were constructed when energy standards were low or non-existent and are otherwise incompatible with current standards or the expectations of users Much of the existing building stock is likely to be in use for many years to come since demolition and replacement is often unacceptable owing to cost social disruption or because the building is of architectural and or historical interest The solution is to refurbish or renovate such buildings to make them appropriate for current and future use and to satisfy current requirements and standards of energy use and comfort Sustainable refurbishment is not a new concept but is gaining recognition and importance owing to current concerns about high energy use leading to climate change overheating in buildings the need for healthy internal environments waste and environmental damage associated with materials production Many governments are beginning to realize the importance of sustainably renovating their existing building stock rather than just raising standards for new buildings and developments and are producing guidance and grants and other support and stimulation activities Think-tanks lobby groups and voluntary organizations continue to publicize and promote the need for and practice of sustainable refurbishment For these reasons multiple countries have started to develop demonstration projects The techniques of sustainable refurbishment have been developing over many years and though the principles are very similar to those used on new buildings the practice and details appropriate for the wide range of situations found in old buildings has required development of specific solutions and guidance to optimize the process and avoid subsequent problems Recently many government-sponsored sources have developed technical guidance regarding sustainable refurbishment practices and have published their findings Retrofits edit Thermal insulation retrofit works on a department store building in Poland Most retrofits can be considered somewhat green because rather than constructing a new building an existing one is improved This saves resources that would otherwise be used to build an entirely new structure A green retrofit typically aims to incorporate sustainability and save energy costs with each design decision Retrofitting a building inherently carries the constraints of the existing building and site For example the orientation of a building in regard to the sun has a great impact on its energy performance but it s generally not within the scope of a retrofit to rotate the building Budgetary constraints also often impact the energy conservation measures proposed Until recently green retrofits have generally been considered as one-off projects for specific buildings or clients but given the increased emphasis on improving the energy efficiency of existing building stock in the face of climate change they are beginning to be reviewed systematically and at scale The main challenge this presents for governments and advocacy groups is that the existing building stock is characterized by different uses located in disparate climatic areas and uses different construction traditions and system technologies Because of these disparities it is difficult to characterize strategies that apply to all buildings Green retrofits have recently garnered considerable research attention due to government emphasis on retrofitting old building stock to address climate change It is estimated that up to half of building stock is always over years old Older buildings have significantly worse energy performance than their modern counterparts due to shortcomings in their design deterioration in mechanical system efficiency and increases in envelope permeability The energy use intensity of houses in the United States dropped from to due to improvements in end-use energy efficiency and code improvements However this is offset by the overall increase in the total number of houses Reasons edit Climate Change edit One of the objectives of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change UNFCCC is the mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to climate change More specifically the UN supports the immediate reduction of building-related greenhouse gas emissions Building refurbishment plays a key role in the decarbonization of the current building stock Other than tearing down existing buildings it is the only way to improve building performance or to develop zero-emission buildings Energy-efficient refurbishments are a tool to reduce energy consumption in buildings which will result in lower greenhouse gas emissions and resource use Studies present the significance of the possible impact of widespread refurbishment implementation on individual GHG emissions but also worldwide emissions and energy consumption Environmental Justice Social Sustainability edit Social sustainability relates to the impacts of a building on the surrounding or occupying society community and individuals This is considered in environmental impact assessment tools such as life cycle assessment LCA Sustainable refurbishment integrates economic social and environmental needs to improve upon the existing building conditions For example sustainable buildings are socially sustainable because they are healthier for occupants due to the use of materials that do not negatively impact health Organizations such as Her Retrofit Space in the UK focus on empowering women professionals in the retrofit industry By providing resources training access and networking opportunities they aim to close the gender gap in the industry while advancing sustainable refurbishment practices With the need to expand the workforce in many countries advocating women in the workforce is an important aspect of driving workforce growth Indoor Environmental Quality edit The indoor environmental quality of the existing building stock is known to often be more unsatisfactory and unhealthy than the outdoor environment due to the design and materials used The leading argument for sustainable refurbishment and sustainable building in general is the belief that green buildings are healthier and more satisfactory for occupants The specifications for sustainable refurbishments take measures to ensure that the materials and building framework does not radiate dangerous particulates and gasses like sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide into the indoor environment and further measures are taken to filter indoor air for inhabitants The Citizen s Healthcare Principle states that sustainable refurbishments must ensure that buildings are safe and improve living quality for those inside The refurbishment design must consider both the indoor microclimate and the external environment around the building when developing the program The microclimate parameters that should be considered include Air velocity Humidity Dew point Lighting Air circulation velocity Acoustics Temperature Historic Conservation edit The preservation of historic buildings is inherently sustainable since it maximizes the lifespan of existing materials and infrastructure Conserving the materials and existing structures reduces waste and preserves the character of small historic communities Many argue that the epitome of sustainability is to not build at all which equites to preservation and refurbishment Finite Resources Materials and Energy edit As a society we have a finite amount of many resources nonrenewable energy sources for example Non-sustainable buildings in terms of their operation also consume a significant amount of non-renewable energy resources relative to other industries Again it is necessary to increase the energy efficiency of the existing building stick to reduce non-renewable energy resource consumption or even replace that with renewable sources entirely Efficiency can be improved through sustainable building refurbishments that modify the building systems and building operations With buildings becoming more energy efficient it is increasingly important to look at the life cycle impact of the materials that make up the building Designing and constructing buildings that are not sustainable for long lifetimes allows for the construction and demolition of buildings with short lifetimes which wastes construction materials that are not used for their entire lifetime capacity Reusing existing buildings enables building owners to use the embodied energy that is already invested in the building composition rather than wasting that embodied carbon and consuming more with a new building construction Development of the Goals of Sustainable Refurbishment edit This section lays out a timeline and progression of the development of the goals of sustainable refurbishment from a few different authors The main goals of sustainable development by Baldwin in include minimizing the impact on human health and the environment optimal use of non-renewable resources utilizing renewable resources and future planning and adaptability Minimizing impact on the climate and ecological system is achieved through a reduction of emissions of greenhouse gasses which is connected to the other goal of optimizing the use of non-renewable resources By reducing the non-renewable energy sources used to construct and operate buildings the embodied greenhouse gas emissions from buildings are also reduced The refurbishment could also attempt to protect and enhance local ecology through landscape architecture Human health is preserved by increasing ventilation and air filtration of indoor spaces and by avoiding potentially harmful construction materials that can impact respiratory health This can also be achieved by encouraging the reuse or recycling of materials to reduce or eliminate material waste The goal of renewable resource use can be achieved in a refurbishment by electrifying the home s heating and cooling systems by installing on-site renewables generation and storage or by using renewable resource products as building materials like timber Building for the future can be achieved through refurbishment by making an existing building more durable and extending the previous lifespan of the building In Keeping and Shiers described the goals of green refurbishments as having three parts The first part includes lower utility costs since less energy is consumed due to a combination of efficient and passive heating and cooling systems The second part ensures lower maintenance costs since the refurbished systems are simpler and were installed to be accessible for repairs Finally the third portion claims that buildings with green refurbishments are healthier and more comfortable for occupants Ultimately in Sitar et al defined the principles of sustainable refurbishments The goals include decreasing the energy used during operation which includes heating cooling ventilation lighting etc Another goal is the utilization of both renewable energy sources and low-impact materials regarding the indoor micro-environment as well as the exterior macro-environment They claim to achieve improvement in living conditions in terms of human health user-friendly controls and adaptability for future needs The goal is that this all be achieved through innovation planning to develop a design that is environmentally economically and socially beneficial Characteristics of Sustainable Refurbishment edit Holistic Improvement edit Sustainable refurbishments aim to reach total building performance optimization with the integrates of multiple systems throughout the building and the community The refurbishment not only decreases energy consumption but also improves occupant comfort in terms of noise temperature lighting etc It extends the life cycle of the building reduces environmental impact and creates healthy occupant conditions Environmental Responsibility edit Sustainable refurbishments aim to minimize the negative environmental impacts of the renovation by reducing quantities of harmful materials utilizing energy-saving technology and retrofitting the building for renewable energy use as opposed to non-renewable energy sources Some responsible environmental measures that can be incorporated in a building retrofit include energy and water efficiency waste reduction and recycling use of low environmental impact materials and effective building operation An example of energy-efficient designs could include high-efficiency lighting and smart controls Similarly an example of water-efficient design could include dual-flushing toilets greywater recycling or aerating water fixtures Energy Efficiency edit A sustainable retrofit ensures that the energy performance of the building after renovation is significantly better than it was before the work The increase in energy performance must meet the current building regulations for new buildings The sustainable approach would be to even design beyond the code minimum and plan for future requirements A deep energy refurbishment should include the integration of energy generation on-site from renewable energy sources with the goal of developing a nearly zero-energy building The energy efficiency gained through the architectural retrofit makes the integration of renewable energy sources cost-effective A study in the United Kingdom showed that after a refurbishment buildings had lower operating costs even if sustainability was not a priority of the retrofit A study of energy refurbishments of residential buildings showed that the refurbishment led to an average thermal energy savings of during the heating season The savings consisted of from thermal insulation addition in exterior walls and floor from window insulation improvements from a reduction in air exchange and from the installation of heating controls The retrofit of the building envelope and operation reduced the energy consumption of the building the associated greenhouse gas emissions during the operation phase and the overall environmental impact Sustainable refurbishment ensures energy efficiency by improving the following systems Insulation Building Envelope Tightness Heating Cooling Conditioning Lighting There are typical strategies to improve upon each of the above systems Innovative insulation materials can be utilized that have a lower environmental impact but even non-sustainable insulation additions can improve the energy performance of the building The building envelope can be improved by replacing the existing windows with efficient windows in terms of thermal bridging and optimizing solar gain The use of passive ventilation strategies or hybrid systems that use both passive and active strategies reduces the energy required for conditioning Buildings heating and cooling systems can be powered with solar energy or even use solar-heated water which both reduce non-renewable energy consumption through heating and cooling Finally the electricity used for lighting can be reduced by optimizing daylighting in occupiable spaces Improved Materials Based on Impact edit The overall environmental impact of a sustainable refurbishment is highly dependent on the material choices for the refurbishment The Rational Resources Principle for refurbishment encourages the efficient use of construction materials and natural resources This is quantified through life cycle analysis that measures the impact of a material over its lifetime which stretches into the D phase that includes end-of-life waste after the building is demolished Waste transportation adds costs to both construction and building maintenance Designing refurbishments that reduce waste and maximize reuse minimize waste hauling costs in the short-term and long-term by using materials for their entire intended life When materials can be compared on the basis of a common bottom line through life cycle analysis an optimum path for the design appears Ultimately since the refurbishment will require additional construction materials there will be a negative environmental impact but the aim of sustainable refurbishment is to minimize these impacts For example reusing on-site timber using reclaimed timber and using timber from renewable certified sources are sustainable material choices based on taking advantage of the embodied carbon that has already been invested in those materials As was mentioned prior the analysis of the life cycle of building materials primary energy demand and global warming potential is becoming more important as buildings are consuming less energy during their operation The human health impact of materials is also included in their life cycle assessment meaning that a construction material cannot be sustainable if it harms its occupants Therefore sustainable refurbishments should not include adhesives paints or glues that expel low-volatile organic compounds into the indoor air of the building Materials that harm indoor occupants or the exterior ecology are considered lethal and are therefore not utilized in sustainable refurbishments Concept Model edit The image shown clarification needed is a conceptual model of sustainable refurbishment The dimensions of the model include technical economic architectural social ecological and cultural The dimensions are all related and influence each other and the refurbishment design itself Steps of Sustainable Refurbishment Process edit The principle of sustainable refurbishment should be incorporated into the project development from the first blueprint through building commissioning and turnover This section provides a generalized description of steps in the design process for a sustainable refurbishment Data collection This includes analyzing the problem formulation and developing project goals Determination of the degree of refurbishment necessary Multiple conditions of the building must be investigated before modeling can be done including physical deterioration the presence of moisture any thermal bridging whether current code requirements are met if there is high energy demand consumption the quality of the indoor environmental and air quality the quality of the outdoor air quality and whether the building has unsatisfied occupants Modeling phase In order to develop a model architects must first analyze the data collected develop criteria to base the alternative comparison and develop design alternatives consider stakeholders and look at best practices Selection Phase Once multiple options are available for the building architects must evaluate alternative layouts address strengths and weaknesses and then ultimately choose a recommendation and optimize the chosen design Implementation Phase In the modeling phase the greater environment impacted by the refurbishment is often accounted for and then decisions are made based on this context The social and political conditions of the community also need to be considered especially the living conditions and standards of those within the buildings being updated Finally the ecological conditions need to be considered including the average temperature humidity soil quality natural resources and topography With all of these conditions in mind the necessary changes can finally be implemented Components of a green retrofit edit Integrated design edit Green retrofits utilize an integrated design strategy This is in opposition to the traditional waterfall design strategy in which architects engineers and contractors operate independently from one another In an integrated design strategy these teams work together to leverage their areas of expertise and solve design problems while also considering the building as a whole This is imperative for a green retrofit where the design solutions are often constrained by the existing site This could relate to the orientation and geometry of the existing building form the size of the site or the installation requirements of the existing and proposed mechanical systems Because these constraints affect all aspects of building design the only way sustainable effective and cost-efficient solutions can be synthesized is when project teams consider all these aspects from the project start Occupant behavior edit Many sustainable building practices are passive and can be automated like insulation or light controls Others depend on the behavior of the building s occupants to realize their full energy efficiency potential An energy-efficient heating system does very little good if the windows are left open in winter Per Ascione et al the first lever of energy efficiency is a proper energy education of users Green retrofits can involve training building occupants in sustainable practices and building systems that they ll interact with which helps ensure that any energy conservation measures used will reach their full design potential Training can be handled by system manufacturers or the project design team Smart energy management can also be implemented into sustainable buildings through AI-driven HVAC lighting systems climate control and adaptive lighting With AI these building functions can be controlled based on activity patterns to more efficiently manage energy Additionally behavior-responsive water fixtures can be implemented to limit water usage based on user habits LED bulbs are a popular and effective choice for green lighting retrofits Lighting retrofits edit One of the most common forms of a green retrofit is a full or partial lighting retrofit A lighting retrofit usually consists of replacing all or some of the lightbulbs in a building with newer more efficient models This can also include changing light fixtures ballasts and drivers LED bulbs are generally the preferred choice in a lighting retrofit because of their greatly increased efficiency compared to incandescent bulbs but other types of bulbs like compact fluorescent or metal halides may be used as well Lighting retrofits are a popular form of green retrofit because compared to other methods of improving energy efficiency they are relatively straightforward to plan and execute and the energy savings often provide a quick return on investment Most modern LED and compact fluorescent bulbs are designed to work with existing light fixtures and rarely involve any additional work than removing and screwing in a new lightbulb The installation is also relatively quick compared to more invasive energy conservation measures Lighting retrofits can also include implementing new lighting controls like occupancy sensors daylight sensors and timers When correctly implemented these controls can reduce the demand for lighting However due to the complicated nature of lighting controls there is debate as to whether or not they are an effective energy conserving measure because of the prevalence of over-optimistic energy usage reduction estimates and the difficulty in predicting the actions of human occupants HVAC retrofits edit Heating ventilation and air conditioning HVAC account for around of a building s operating energy consumption and HVAC retrofits can account for - of energy savings Reducing this consumption can provide both energy and cost savings so it is the main focus of many green retrofits especially in colder climates where heating accounts for over of energy use The heating system cooling system air handling systems humidification systems and ductwork in the building are often considered Heat recovery ventilation is recommended for newly air-sealed homes as it uses the heat from the warm moist stale air that is being vented from the home to warm the cool fresh and filtered air that is entering the home This allows for minimal heat loss while mitigating concerns of carbon monoxide poisoning radon gas or harmful particulates accumulating in the home Other green HVAC retrofits can include implementing a newer more efficient model of the same type as the existing system such as replacing an old water boiler with a more efficient one to feed a hydronic heating system Sometimes a larger system overhaul is merited for example exchanging an old boiler for a newer ground or air source heat pump system A blower door test can locate leaks in a building envelope Building envelope retrofits edit Thermal insulation and building envelope performance are key to the overall energy performance of any building Many older buildings are not insulated up to current standards let alone up to the standards recommended in many green building rating systems Many of these buildings spend energy and money heating cooling or conditioning the air inside them only to see it seep out through leaks in the building envelope or through poorly insulated windows During many green retrofits the first step towards improving the building s envelope is to evaluate its current shortcomings Air-sealing is an easily accessible and cost-efficient way to improve the energy efficiency of a home that is mechanically heated or cooled Caulking can be used to fill gaps in immobile areas like window and door frames and or poorly sealed appliances Weather stripping can be used where moving parts meet such as the area between the door and the doorframe or windows that can open These drafty areas can be found by feeling for temperature differences and drafts on days when the temperature inside the house is dramatically different than the temperature outside the house burning incense and watching how the smoke moves to detect drafts or hiring a professional to perform a blower door test In a blower door test a door with a fan and a gauge is installed into one of the doorways and the house is depressurized The gauge can then measure the air changes per hour ACH or how many times the volume of air in the house is completely replaced in one hour The draftier a house is the higher the air changes per hour will be Window retrofits edit Windows are the weakest point of insulation in a building s envelope and contribute greatly to how thermally effective that envelope is Because of this windows are another common area of focus for a green retrofit Similar to a lighting retrofit windows are a relatively straightforward aspect of a building to retrofit with easy-to-calculate payback periods Modern efficient windows are generally sized for existing window openings and can usually be installed without much additional work on the building envelope Most green retrofits will replace older single-pane windows with more efficient triple-paned varieties that are filled with an inert gas such as argon or krypton These windows have greater R-values so they insulate a space far better than single-pane windows Some windows have low-e coatings to control the solar heat gain coefficient Green roof retrofits edit The Chicago City Hall retrofitted a semi-intensive green roof in Green roofs also called living roofs have a number of major benefits including reducing stormwater runoff and urban heat island effect increasing roof insulation improving building acoustics and providing biodiversity There are many factors to account for when considering a green roof for a green retrofit Extensive green roofs use a thin substrate layer for the often shorter vegetation that needs less room for roots to grow Intensive green roofs use a thicker growing substrate to accommodate larger plant species that require more space for their roots Semi-intensive green roofs fall somewhere in between the two The strength of the existing structure must be considered many existing structures were not designed for an intensive green roof which can carry a considerable structural load The existing roof also needs to be evaluated for stripping or re-waterproofing Some roofs can simply be laid over with sedum mats while others require additional work to prepare A peaked or sloped roof does not preclude the installation of a green roofing system but can influence the installation costs and product choices available In general older buildings with lower existing insulation values benefit the most from green roof retrofits and where there are no modifications necessary to install one green roofs have been shown to have many benefits Passive design edit Passive design is a design strategy that uses the shape and placement of the architecture and landscaping to heat cool light ventilate and sometimes provide power to the building Often this impacts the shape of the building envelope the orientation of the building and the placement of the building The shape of the building can also create microclimates in which the building is designed to trap heat or funnel breezes for warming in the winter or cooling in the summer While these passive design elements are more often applied in newly built green buildings passive design can still be a consideration in green retrofits For example if there are windows that receive very little sunlight in the winter or a large amount of sunlight in the summer those may be replaced first to reduce an undesirable amount of heat lost in the winter or gained in the summer Using landscaping such as planting a deciduous tree in front of south-facing windows to maximize solar heat gain in the winter while shading the windows in the summer is also an example of passive design Sustainable Refurbishment Case Study edit A case study in Vienna explored the impact of a sustainable refurbishment that included a Multi-Active Fa ade System The assumption of the study was that the improvement of the outermost layer of the structure the fa ade shell was the most important regarding energy efficiency Insulation specifically was a major contributor to energy savings during building operation and a life cycle analysis was required to make an informed decision about the insulation material The fa ade system in this study reduced the building s energy demand with insulation and corrugated board which passively increased the solar gain in the winter when extra heat was required to minimize energy consumption and reduced the solar gain during the summer This was achieved by installing the fa ade at a strategic angle to allow ultraviolet rays to pass through only when the sun is at its lower winter angle The fa ade also integrated renewable energy generation into the shell itself as well as energy storage for when there is no active radiation After the sustainable refurbishment with the new facade the heating demand for the building was modeled to be about less than the baseline value The low energy demand even exceeded the new building standard requirements for by about making the design adaptable and resilient for the future Costs barriers and benefits edit Possible benefits of green retrofits include but are not exclusive to improved energy security reduced air pollution improved indoor air quality through technology such as MVHR reduced greenhouse gas emissions and impact on climate change increased thermal comfort enhanced indoor air quality and occupant health generation of local jobs and reduction of peak electrical demand Possible barriers to green retrofits include initial cost and financing lack of knowledge and experience of the designers architects construction workers inspectors and financial institutions involved in the project building code regulations and lack of consumer interest The scope of a green retrofit can vary widely It can involve specific building systems like the lighting or can be a full renovation of all non-structural components While a lighting retrofit is straightforward to execute and relatively unobtrusive to building occupants it will not generally carry as much of a benefit or cost as an insulation retrofit When weighing the benefits and costs of a green retrofit each of these components are typically considered towards the project as a whole While green retrofits do have an up-front cost the amount depends on how extensive the retrofits are Likewise the kind of retrofit that is implemented will also impact how fast the investment is returned in savings The economic feasibility of a green retrofit depends on the state of installed systems of the existing building the proposed design the energy costs of the local utility grid and the climatic conditions of the site Any economic incentives granted will depend on what country or state the project is in These incentives differ regionally and can affect the total project feasibility In Ireland for example shallow green retrofits have been found to be economically feasible but deep retrofits are often not feasible without government grant aid to offset the initial capital costs The EU has found that implementing green retrofit programs comes with the benefit of energy security job creation fuel poverty alleviation health and indoor comfort Green retrofits can carry benefits such as the re-use of existing building material Concrete and steel have some of the highest embodied energy impacts of any building material and can account for up to of the carbon used in the construction of a building They are primarily used in the structure of a building which usually remains untouched in retrofits Most types of green retrofit introduce new building materials into the space which can themselves emit harmful indoor air pollutants The amount type and exposure to these pollutants will depend on the material itself what it is used for and how it is installed Often green retrofits call for sealing leaks in the building envelope to prevent the escape of conditioned air but if this is not offset by an increase in ventilation it can contribute to higher concentrations of indoor air pollutants in the building Responses and Criticism edit Social Justice edit This gap in building improvement is moving toward being more frequently addressed by policymakers to avoid an environmental justice issue with a two-tiered market The premium stock has high rental prices which incentivize owners to invest in them further which is not the case for the lower quality stock Many argue that it is not just that only occupants that can afford premium housing get to live in the ensured healthy and comfortable environment of a sustainable refurbishment The Affordability Principle states that sustainable refurbishments should be affordable for the general population Health disparities and carbon emissions may also be reduced through the implementation of making building more efficient thus ensuring a more equitable future for all In addition many call for the information about sustainable refurbishment to be shared and freely available to people of all income levels ages races etc in order that everyone have an equal opportunity to live better Technological Developments Needed edit There is criticism of the efficacy of sustainable refurbishment in terms of decarbonizing the current building stock This criticism is directed specifically toward large-scale energy refurbishments of industrial structures One could argue that the embodied and operational carbon of those types of buildings are significantly larger than that of smaller residential or office buildings which are discussed in this article However the technology to efficiently heat cool and power these structures do not yet exist and they cannot completely rely on passive strategies due to more stringent code restrictions It cannot be expected that these large-impact buildings be refurbished if it cannot be done economically This argument impacts the hopeful global energy consumption decrease that researchers propose for sustainable refurbishments Adaptability of Current Housing Stock edit Another criticism of sustainable refurbishments is that not all existing buildings are good candidates for refurbishment Put plainly it is challenging to improve on buildings that were poorly designed from the start It was proven that floor plans that are typical with deep shapes were more adaptable than irregular designs Similarly floor-to-floor heights impact the designer and contractor s ability to modify utility ducts meaning that taller buildings are easier to refurbish Research also shows that structures that qualify as higher grade building stock experience greater levels and frequency of sustainable refurbishment There seem to be a number of reasons for this one being that premium buildings undergo retrofit earlier in their lifecycle in order to compete with newer sustainable buildings It can be argued that it is not sustainable to replace building systems early in their lifecycle just to invest in additional embodied carbon and discard the old equipment into a landfill However there is an opportunity for young removed materials to be utilized in lower-quality refurbishments in low-income communities In an Australian study using data from it was found that about of all premium retrofits were to buildings that were less than years old with the remaining aged between and years old The same study showed that no refurbishments occurred in the least desirable stock locations Case Studies edit Journal Of International Affairs edit Based on a study conducted by the Journal of International Affairs of citizens from urban areas of citizens from suburban areas and of citizens from rural areas have a high interest in smart street lighting Smart street lighting refers to street lighting systems that use technology to improve public street lighting efficiency safety and management with energy-efficient LEDs that utilize sensors and wireless connectivity to allow for the remote control and monitoring of lighting levels based on real-time conditions With these systems the brightness of street lights is automatically adjusted based on various conditions such as the time of day level of traffic and environmental conditions Essentially smart street lighting saves energy by effectively managing the energy used for lighting Even further of citizens from both urban and suburban areas and of citizens living in rural areas are interested in free public Wifi networks as part of smart city initiatives Free public Wifi networks are essential for smart cities as they support the various initiatives within smart cities and enable digital inclusion by bridging the digital divide and enhancing economic opportunities More so of citizens from urban areas of citizens from suburban areas and of citizens from rural areas are interested in smart cities implementing monitoring for critical systems Critical systems monitoring refers to the real-time tracking and analysis of city functions using technology in order to identify and address any potential issues within city operation systems With the use of cameras sensors and devices data is gathered on the infrastructure service and public safety within urban areas and rapid responses are formed to optimize city operations And finally of citizens in urban areas of citizens in suburban areas and of citizens in rural areas are in favor of public transportation as part of smart cities With technology smart cities are able to improve public transportation systems by offering benefits such as real-time travel information congestion control and increased urban mobility Bio Web of Conferences edit The BIO Web of Conferences conducted a study where they measured the initial carbon emissions of four cities and then implemented smart city initiatives and measured the carbon emissions after the implementation of these technologies They saw a significant reduction in carbon emissions within all cities especially those that had high initial emissions For example sample city B which had initial emissions of tons of carbon per year had post-test emissions of tons of carbon per year This represents a reduction in carbon emissions Impressive right Meanwhile sample city D which had initial emissions of saw post-test emissions of representing an decrease in carbon emissions The most important factor at play is most likely the fact that sample city B had much more significant initial carbon emissions than sample city D Bio Web of Conferences edit The BIO Web of Conferences conducted another similar study where they tested the carbon reduction based on the implementation of various initiatives Green energy projects saw carbon emission reductions of tons per year while public transportation upgrades saw reductions of tons per year energy-efficient buildings saw reductions of tons per year and waste management improvements saw reductions of tons per year Clearly all smart city initiatives have a positive environmental impact with some being more substantial than others such as high-frequency services such as public transportation Example demonstration projects edit http www dena de http www superhomes org uk Sources of technical guidance edit http www herretrofitspace com supports professional women in

    "content": "Waste-to-energy - Wikipedia Jump to content From Wikipedia the free encyclopedia Process of generating energy from the primary treatment of waste For energy wasted from a machine see waste heat WtE redirects here For other uses see WTE Spittelau incineration plant de with its distinct Hundertwasser facade is providing combined heat and power in Vienna Waste-to-energy WtE or energy-from-waste EfW refers to a series of processes designed to convert waste materials into usable forms of energy typically electricity or heat As a form of energy recovery WtE plays a crucial role in both waste management and sustainable energy production by reducing the volume of waste in landfills and providing an alternative energy source The most common method of WtE is direct combustion of waste to produce heat which can then be used to generate electricity via steam turbines This method is widely employed in many countries and offers a dual benefit it disposes of waste while generating energy making it an efficient process for both waste reduction and energy production In addition to combustion other WtE technologies focus on converting waste into fuel sources For example gasification and pyrolysis are processes that thermochemically decompose organic materials in the absence of oxygen to produce syngas a synthetic gas primarily composed of hydrogen carbon monoxide and small amounts of carbon dioxide This syngas can be converted into methane methanol ethanol or even synthetic fuels which can be used in various industrial processes or as alternative fuels in transportation Furthermore anaerobic digestion a biological process converts organic waste into biogas mainly methane and carbon dioxide through microbial action This biogas can be harnessed for energy production or processed into biomethane which can serve as a substitute for natural gas The WtE process contributes to circular economy principles by transforming waste products into valuable resources reducing dependency on fossil fuels and mitigating greenhouse gas emissions However challenges remain particularly in ensuring that emissions from WtE plants such as dioxins and furans are properly managed to minimize environmental impact Advanced pollution control technologies are essential to address these concerns and ensure WtE remains a viable environmentally sound solution WtE technologies present a significant opportunity to manage waste sustainably while contributing to global energy demands They represent an essential component of integrated waste management strategies and a shift toward renewable energy systems As technology advances WtE may play an increasingly critical role in both reducing landfill use and enhancing energy security History edit In the early history around BCE open burning of waste was practiced in Jerusalem where the ashes were used as fertilizer As human settlements grew burning waste became common to reduce waste volume and to combat rats and disease though not yet for energy production It was not until the late th century that the first attempts were made to produce energy from burning waste The first unsuccessful incinerator was built around in London A few years later in the Destructor was built by Manlove Alliott Co Ltd in Nottingham UK to the design of Alfred Fryer The USA s first incinerator was built in on Governors Island in New York New York In first waste-to-energy unit in Denmark was built in Frederiksberg Copenhagen The first facility in the Czech Republic was built in in Brno These first incinerators lacked control of emissions leading to severe air soil and water pollution with heavy metals acid gasses and toxic organics By the s the public awareness of health and environmental protection increased resulting in a holistic view of waste management Air pollution control systems were developed to reduce the emissions of hazardous substances by more than As part of this innovation the heat was used either directly for heating or for producing electricity Technologies for processing residual solid mixed waste have only become a focus of attention in recent years stimulated by the search for more efficient energy recovery Methods edit Incineration edit Main article Incineration Incineration the combustion of organic material such as waste with energy recovery is the most common WtE implementation All new WtE plants in OECD countries incinerating waste residual MSW commercial industrial or RDF must meet strict emission standards including those on nitrogen oxides NO x sulphur dioxide SO heavy metals and dioxins Hence modern incineration plants are vastly different from old types some of which neither recovered energy nor materials Modern incinerators reduce the volume of the original waste by - percent depending upon composition and degree of recovery of materials such as metals from the ash for recycling Incinerators may emit fine particulate heavy metals trace dioxin and acid gas even though these emissions are relatively low from modern incinerators Other concerns include proper management of residues toxic fly ash which must be handled in hazardous waste disposal installation as well as incinerator bottom ash IBA which must be reused properly Critics argue that incinerators destroy valuable resources and they may reduce incentives for recycling The question however is an open one as European countries which recycle the most up to also incinerate to avoid landfilling Incinerators have electric efficiencies of - In order to avoid losing the rest of the energy it can be used for e g district heating cogeneration The total efficiencies of cogeneration incinerators are typically higher than based on the lower heating value of the waste The method of incineration to convert municipal solid waste MSW is a relatively old method of WtE generation Incineration generally entails burning waste residual MSW commercial industrial and RDF to boil water which powers steam generators that generate electric energy and heat to be used in homes businesses institutions and industries One problem associated is the potential for pollutants to enter the atmosphere with the flue gases from the boiler These pollutants can be acidic and in the s were reported to cause environmental degradation by turning rain into acid rain Modern incinerators incorporate carefully engineered primary and secondary burn chambers and controlled burners designed to burn completely with the lowest possible emissions eliminating in some cases the need for lime scrubbers and electro-static precipitators on smokestacks By passing the smoke through the basic lime scrubbers any acids that might be in the smoke are neutralized which prevents the acid from reaching the atmosphere and hurting the environment Many other devices such as fabric filters reactors and catalysts destroy or capture other regulated pollutants According to the New York Times modern incineration plants are so clean that many times more dioxin is now released from home fireplaces and backyard barbecues than from incineration According to the German Environmental Ministry because of stringent regulations waste incineration plants are no longer significant in terms of emissions of dioxins dust and heavy metals Compared with other waste to energy technologies incineration seems to be the most attractive due to its higher power production efficiency lower investment costs and lower emission rates Additionally incineration yields the highest amount of electricity with the highest capacity to lessen pile of wastes in landfills through direct combustion Fuel from plastics edit One process that is used to convert plastic into fuel is pyrolysis the thermal decomposition of materials at high temperatures in an inert atmosphere It involves change of chemical composition and is mainly used for treatment of organic materials In large scale production plastic waste is ground and melted and then pyrolyzed Catalytic converters help in the process The vapours are condensed with oil or fuel and accumulated in settling tanks and filtered Fuel is obtained after homogenation and can be used for automobiles and machinery It is commonly termed as thermofuel or energy from plastic A new process uses a two-part catalyst cobalt and zeolite to convert plastics into propane It works on polyethylene and polypropylene and the propane yield is approximately Other edit There are a number of other new and emerging technologies that are able to produce energy from waste and other fuels without direct combustion Many of these technologies have the potential to produce more electric power from the same amount of fuel than would be possible by direct combustion This is mainly due to the separation of corrosive components ash from the converted fuel thereby allowing higher combustion temperatures in e g boilers gas turbines internal combustion engines fuel cells Some advanced technologies are able to efficiently convert the energy in the feedstocks into liquid or gaseous fuels using heat but in the absence of oxygen without actual combustion by using a combination of thermal technologies Typically they are cleaner as the feedstock is separated prior to treatment to remove the unwanted components Pyrolysis Plant Thermal treatment technologies include Gasification produces combustible gas hydrogen synthetic fuels Thermal depolymerization produces synthetic crude oil which can be further refined Pyrolysis produces combustible tar bio-oil and chars Plasma arc gasification or plasma gasification process PGP produces rich syngas including hydrogen and carbon monoxide usable for fuel cells or generating electricity to drive the plasma arch usable vitrified silicate and metal ingots salt and sulphur Landfill Gas Collection Non-thermal technologies Anaerobic digestion Biogas rich in methane Fermentation production examples are ethanol lactic acid hydrogen Mechanical biological treatment MBT MBT Anaerobic digestion MBT to Refuse derived fuel Global developments edit Waste-to-energy generating capacity in the United States Waste-to-energy plants in the United States During the period the waste-to-energy capacity increased by about four million metric tons per year Japan and China each built several plants based on direct smelting or on fluidized bed combustion of solid waste In China there were about waste-to-energy plants in early Japan is the largest user in thermal treatment of municipal solid waste in the world with million tons annually Some of the newest plants use stoker technology and others use the advanced oxygen enrichment technology Several treatment plants exist worldwide using relatively novel processes such as direct smelting the Ebara fluidization process and the Thermoselect JFE gasification and melting technology process As of June Indonesia had a total of MW installed capacity of waste-to-energy with a pipeline of projects in different preparation phases together amounting to another MW of capacity India s first Waste-to-Energy processing facility was established by the Timarpur-Okhla Waste Management Company Pvt Ltd s TOWMCL in Delhi in January Per day it processes tonnes of solid waste and generates MW of renewable energy India s first IGBC platinum-rated net-zero Green Waste-to-Energy Campus is in Jamnagar Gujarat established by Abellon Clean energy and designed by INI Design Studio The facility processes tons year of Municipal Solid Waste into MW clean energy The facility s design involves almost no human interface during the process and also has a see-through design inside the processing plant making it an educational hub for schools and visitors The campus uses only of its land for the facility and the rest is used for community activities and interactions Biofuel Energy Corporation of Denver Colorado opened two new biofuel plants in Wood River Nebraska and Fairmont Minnesota in July These plants use distillation to make ethanol for use in motor vehicles and other engines Both plants were acquired by Green Plains in As the Fairmont plant was closed down in the Wood River plant reported to be working at capacity in Q - Fulcrum BioEnergy which started in in Pleasanton California built a WtE plant near Reno NV to convert waste to sustainable aviation fuel SAF The plant was in commissioning from to May under the name Sierra BioFuels Fulcrum predicted that the plant would produce approximately million gallons per year of Fischer-Tropsch products from nearly tons per year of MSW The total exported product amounted to just gallons of syncrude which were transported to Marathon Petroleum s refinery for conversion into jet fuel The plant had issues including damage from unexpected generation of nitric acid and deposits of a concrete-like substance up to feet thick in its gasification system In Fulcrum BioEnergy ceased operations at the plant after defaulting on million bonds issued through the Nevada Department of Business and Industry used to fund the plant s construction Waste-to-energy technology includes fermentation which can take biomass and create ethanol using waste cellulosic or organic material In the fermentation process the sugar in the waste is converted to carbon dioxide and alcohol in the same general process that is used to make wine Normally fermentation occurs with no air present Esterification can also be done using waste-to-energy technologies and the result of this process is biodiesel The cost-effectiveness of esterification will depend on the feedstock being used and all the other relevant factors such as transportation distance amount of oil present in the feedstock and others Gasification and pyrolysis by now can reach gross thermal conversion efficiencies fuel to gas up to however a complete combustion is superior in terms of fuel conversion efficiency Some pyrolysis processes need an outside heat source which may be supplied by the gasification process making the combined process self-sustaining Carbon dioxide emissions edit In thermal WtE technologies nearly all of the carbon content in the waste is emitted as carbon dioxide CO to the atmosphere when including final combustion of the products from pyrolysis and gasification except when producing biochar for fertilizer Municipal solid waste MSW contain approximately the same mass fraction of carbon as CO itself so treatment of metric ton short tons of MSW produce approximately metric ton short tons of CO In the event that the waste was landfilled metric ton short tons of MSW would produce approximately cubic metres cu ft methane via the anaerobic decomposition of the biodegradable part of the waste This amount of methane has more than twice the global warming potential than the metric ton short tons of CO which would have been produced by combustion In some countries large amounts of landfill gas are collected However there is still the global warming potential of the landfill gas being emitted to atmosphere For example in the US in landfill gas emission was approximately higher than the amount of CO that would have been emitted by combustion In addition nearly all biodegradable waste is biomass That is it has biological origin This material has been formed by plants using atmospheric CO typically within the last growing season If these plants are regrown the CO emitted from their combustion will be taken out from the atmosphere once more Such considerations are the main reason why several countries administrate WtE of the biomass part of waste as renewable energy The rest mainly plastics and other oil and gas derived products is generally treated as non-renewables The CO emissions from plastic waste-to-energy systems are higher than those from current fossil fuel-based power systems per unit of power generated even after considering the contribution of carbon capture and storage Power generation using plastic waste will significantly increase by Carbon must be separated during energy recovery processes Otherwise the fight against global warming would fail due to plastic waste Determination of the biomass fraction edit MSW to a large extent is of biological origin biogenic e g paper cardboard wood cloth food scraps Typically half of the energy content in MSW is from biogenic material Consequently this energy is often recognised as renewable energy according to the waste input Several methods have been developed by the European CEN working group to determine the biomass fraction of waste fuels such as Refuse Derived Fuel Solid Recovered Fuel The initial two methods developed CEN TS were the manual sorting method and the selective dissolution method A detailed systematic comparison of these two methods was published in Since each method suffered from limitations in properly characterizing the biomass fraction two alternative methods have been developed The first method uses the principles of radiocarbon dating A technical review CEN TR outlining the carbon method was published in A technical standard of the carbon dating method CEN TS was published in In the United States there is already an equivalent carbon method under the standard method ASTM D The second method so-called balance method employs existing data on materials composition and operating conditions of the WtE plant and calculates the most probable result based on a mathematical-statistical model Currently the balance method is installed at three Austrian and eight Danish incinerators A comparison between both methods carried out at three full-scale incinerators in Switzerland showed that both methods came to the same results Carbon dating can determine with precision the biomass fraction of waste and also determine the biomass calorific value Determining the calorific value is important for green certificate programs such as the Renewable Obligation Certificate program in the United Kingdom These programs award certificates based on the energy produced from biomass Several research papers including the one commissioned by the Renewable Energy Association in the UK have been published that demonstrate how the carbon result can be used to calculate the biomass calorific value The UK gas and electricity markets authority Ofgem released a statement in accepting the use of Carbon as a way to determine the biomass energy content of waste feedstock under their administration of the Renewables Obligation Their Fuel Measurement and Sampling FMS questionnaire describes the information they look for when considering such proposals Physical location edit A report commissioned by the Global Alliance for Incinerator Alternatives GAIA done by the Tishman Environment and Design Center at The New School found that of the then operating waste-to-energy facilities in the U S are located in low-income communities and or communities of color because of historic residential racial segregation and expulsive zoning laws that allowed whiter wealthier communities to exclude industrial uses and people of color from their boundaries In Chester Pennsylvania where a community group is actively opposing their local waste-to-energy facility Sintana Vergara an assistant professor in the Department of Environmental Resources Engineering at Humboldt State University in California commented that community resistance is based on both the pollution and the fact that many of these facilities have been sited in communities without any community input and without any benefits to the community In other countries WtE facilities are located adjacent to residental housing without significant conflicts also in high-income areas One prominent example is Amager Bakke in central Copenhagen Denmark Notable examples edit According to a United Nations Environment Programme report there are WtE plants in Europe and in the United States The following are some examples of WtE plants Waste incineration WtE plants edit Essex County Resource Recovery Facility Newark New Jersey Harrisburg

large plants domestic waste-to-energy incinerators also exist For example the Refuge de Sarenne has a domestic waste-to-energy plant It is made by combining a wood-fired gasification boiler with a Stirling motor Australia edit Renergi will scale up their system of converting waste organic materials into liquid fuels using a thermal treatment process in Collie Western Australia The system will

non-domestic heat demand for January to December and actual GB electricity demand Nearly zero heating office building in Rakvere Estonia The zero heating office building in Netherlands Q-Air -pane glazing by Reflex Slovenia U g value of W m K Seasonal energy storage problem edit In areas where there is substantial heating demand it is hard to fill this demand with renewable power as in heating season solar power is in short supply This means heating in highly urbanized areas is directly or indirectly powered by in a large part from fossil sources About TWh of seasonal energy storage is needed to meet EU s winter heating demand should it be alleviated from fossil fuel dependency Since heating is partially routed through electricity e g heat-pumps there is also a clear need for seasonal electricity storage In Germany alone about TWh seasonal storage is required The zero-heating building overcomes the need for major societal infrastructural changes required by the net-zero energy buildings and thus addresses major concerns Zero heating building as a continuation of the Passive house edit Zero-heating buildings are built in the similar way as Passive houses while taking advantage in the recent developments in ultra-low U-value glazing It has been shown that for buildings with window U-values approaching W m K the heating demand diminishes In this way the building would not need a winter power reserve and it obviously would not need any seasonal energy storage Buildings built according to Passive-house standard can provide for removal of the central heating appliance with an only small auxiliary heating provision in the ventilation system First examples edit In Wolfgang Feist demonstrated that with a glazing U-value of W m K zero-heating buildings could be realized The first purpose build nearly zero heating building is an office building built in Rakvere Estonia in Since more examples have been built based on the novel ultra-low U-value glazing Further developments of the Zero-heating building edit A zero-heating building is proposed as a cornerstone of a market acceptable solution to the problem of the CO mitigation through reduction of the need for seasonal energy storage Above the reduction of the need for energy storage there are deletions in shading and truncation in heating arrangements Abandoning now common modulated external shades and switching to more cost-efficient multipane glazing with built-in solar control glass somewhat increases cooling demand The zero-heating building should be designed to keep cooling demand Q NC less than kWh m a for office buildings and less than kWh m a for all other types After capitalizing on the effects made by nearly zero-heating building one can further equip such a building with PV to obtain something of a winter positive energy building which could in principle speed-up alleviation of societal energy problems by providing extra power on time The remaining cooling and ventilation demand can thus be favorably synchronized with solar radiation where maximum photovoltaic generation nearly coincides with the maximum power needed for cooling Standards edit In a consortium partners Reflex Faculty Of Mechanical Engineering - Ljubljana Passivhaus Institut Tallinn University of Technology TalTech and Norwegian University of Science and Technology NTNU has been established to work on Zero-heating building standardization development and promotion Construction costs edit Quadruple glazing as the main add-on component to the passive house cost is essentially that of triple-glazing plus one more intermediate glass pane at about m As quadruple units allow for U-value of glazing to be less than W m K external modulated sun shading and its substantial cost can be omitted without any loss of energy performance Pricing reality at the moment is different As there is no long-term experience design guideline and an established evaluation standard there is a tendency to price quadruple glazing units at a cost of quadruple unit plus the cost of triple unit just in case if something later turned to go seriously wrong requiring building glazing replacement Traits of zero-heating buildings edit Marketability analysis edit Marketability failure of energy efficient buildings and inefficiency in integrated design approach are the main causes of low market penetration of energy efficient buildings Compared to merely focusing on the energy-efficiency enhancement increasing the number of energy efficient buildings with a better marketability via enhancement of their aesthetic features product differentiation is proposed as the approach for energy demand reduction in the building sector The empirical evidence so far shows clearly that the enhancement of aesthetic features and window design can be a supplementary approach to overcome the current market barriers such as a high initial cost a low market value and a lack of market demand for energy efficient buildings The research has identified increased glazing area as the main desired architectural product differentiation If features such as maintenance cost service reliability and tenant comfort some specific differentiating features are indoor air quality natural light distribution and fresh air circulation are included in marketing communications the probability to go for green buildings is likely to be higher Design freedom edit Due to the exceptionally low U-values of glazing used glazed areas are not limited in size due to energy requirements nZEB building can be realized with glazed walls This removes some constraints imposed on the building design by the double and triple-pane glazing Most notably a zero heating building does not need to be purposefully built as a passive solar building Comfort edit Cold downdraught m from the window calculated for double-pane triple-pane and Krypton filled quadruple-pane glazing at indicated glazing heights The well-being of the occupants of a building is an important parameter determined by the environmental quality of the interior Limited or no contact with the environment and living and working with minimal daylight are often a consequence of dynamic sun shading On the contrary multipane glazing offers uninterrupted contact with the environment Low seasonally selective solar gain offers summer comfort while a system U-value of approximately W m K offers nearly zero heating demand in winter even in Scandinavia A low system U-value maintains inside glass temperatures at a consistent level

Building ZEB also known as a Net Zero-Energy NZE building is a building with net zero energy consumption meaning the total amount of energy used by the building on an annual basis is equal to the amount of renewable energy created on the site or in other definitions by renewable energy sources offsite using technology such as heat pumps high efficiency windows and insulation and solar panels The goal is that these buildings contribute less overall greenhouse gas to the atmosphere during operation than similar non-NZE buildings They do at times consume non-renewable energy and produce greenhouse gases but at other times reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas production elsewhere by the same amount The development of zero-energy buildings is encouraged by the desire to have less of an impact on the environment and their expansion is encouraged by tax breaks and savings on energy costs which make zero-energy buildings financially viable Terminology tends to vary between countries agencies cities towns and reports so a general knowledge of this concept and its various uses is essential for a versatile understanding of clean energy and renewables The International Energy Agency IEA and European Union EU most commonly use Net Zero Energy with the term zero net being mainly used in the US A similar concept approved and implemented by the European Union and other agreeing countries is nearly Zero Energy Building nZEB with the goal of having all new buildings in the region under nZEB standards by According to D Agostino and Mazzarella the meaning of nZEB is different in each country This is because countries have different climates rules and ways of calculating energy use These differences make it hard to compare buildings or set one standard for everyone Overview edit Typical code-compliant buildings consume of the total fossil fuel energy in the US and European Union and are significant contributors of greenhouse gases To combat such high energy usage more and more buildings are starting to implement the carbon neutrality principle which is viewed as a means to reduce carbon emissions and reduce dependence on fossil fuels Although zero-energy buildings remain limited even in developed countries they are gaining importance and popularity citation needed Most zero-energy buildings use the electrical grid for energy storage but some are independent of the grid and some include energy storage onsite The buildings are called energy-plus buildings or in some cases low energy houses These buildings produce energy onsite using renewable technology like solar and wind while reducing the overall use of energy with highly efficient lightning and heating ventilation and air conditioning HVAC technologies The zero-energy goal is becoming more practical as the costs of alternative energy technologies decrease and the costs of traditional fossil fuels increase A notable example is the Zero Building in Spain which demonstrates how an office building can achieve net-zero and even positive energy performance through architectural design passive strategies and integrated renewable systems The development of modern zero-energy buildings became possible largely through the progress made in new energy and construction technologies and techniques These include highly insulating spray-foam insulation high-efficiency solar panels high-efficiency heat pumps and highly insulating low emissivity triple and quadruple-glazed windows These innovations have also been significantly improved by academic research which collects precise energy performance data on traditional and experimental buildings and provides performance parameters for advanced computer models to predict the efficacy of engineering designs A study examines how different countries including Italy Germany and Denmark approach nearly zero energy buildings It shows that while the technical solutions are often similar the targets baselines and frameworks for meeting these goals vary significantly D Agostino Mazzarella Zero-energy buildings can be part of a smart grid Some advantages of these buildings are as follows Integration of renewable energy resources Integration of plug-in electric vehicles called vehicle-to-grid Implementation of zero-energy concepts Although the net zero concept is applicable to a wide range of resources water and waste energy is usually the first resource to be targeted because Energy particularly electricity and heating fuel like natural gas or heating oil is expensive Hence reducing energy use can save the building owner money In contrast water and waste are inexpensive for the individual building owner Energy particularly electricity and heating fuel has a high carbon footprint Hence reducing energy use is a major way to reduce the building s carbon footprint There are well-established means to significantly reduce the energy use and carbon footprint of buildings These include adding insulation using heat pumps instead of furnaces using low emissivity triple or quadruple-glazed windows and adding solar panels to the roof In some countries there are government-sponsored subsidies and tax breaks for installing heat pumps solar panels triple or quadruple-glazed windows and insulation that greatly reduce the cost of getting to a net-zero energy building for the building owner Further information BrightBuilt Barn Optimizing zero-energy building for climate impact edit The introduction of zero-energy buildings makes buildings more energy efficient and reduces the rate of carbon emissions once the building is in operation however there is still a lot of pollution associated with a building s embodied carbon Embodied carbon is the carbon emitted in the making and transportation of a building s materials and construction of the structure itself it is responsible for of global GHG emissions and of global building sector emissions The importance of embodied carbon will grow as it will begin to account for the greater portion of a building s carbon emissions In some newer energy efficient buildings embodied carbon has risen to of the building s lifetime emissions Focusing on embodied carbon is part of optimizing construction for climate impact and zero carbon emissions requires slightly different considerations from optimizing only for energy efficiency A study found that between and reducing upfront carbon emissions and switching to clean or renewable energy is more important than increasing building efficiency because building a highly energy efficient structure can actually produce more greenhouse gas than a basic code compliant one if carbon-intensive materials are used The study stated that because Net-zero energy codes will not significantly reduce emissions in time policy makers and regulators must aim for true net zero carbon buildings not net zero energy buildings One way to reduced embodied carbon is by using low-carbon materials for construction such as straw wood linoleum or cedar For materials like concrete and steel options to reduce embodied emissions do exist however these are unlikely to be available at large scale in the short-term In conclusion it has been determined that the optimal design point for greenhouse gas reduction appeared to be at four story multifamily buildings of low-carbon materials such as those listed above which could be a template for low-carbon emitting structures Definitions edit Despite sharing the name zero net energy there are several definitions of what the term means in practice with a particular difference in usage between North America and Europe Zero net site energy use In this type of ZNE the amount of energy provided by on-site renewable energy sources is equal to the amount of energy used by the building In the United States zero net energy building generally refers to this type of building Zero net source energy use This ZNE generates the same amount of energy as is used including the energy used to transport the energy to the building This type accounts for energy losses during electricity generation and transmission These ZNEs must generate more electricity than zero net site energy buildings Net zero energy emissions Outside the United States and Canada a ZEB is generally defined as one with zero net energy emissions also known as a zero carbon building ZCB or zero emissions building ZEB Under this definition the carbon emissions generated from on-site or off-site fossil fuel use are balanced by the amount of on-site renewable energy production Other definitions include not only the carbon emissions generated by the building in use but also those generated in the construction of the building and the embodied energy of the structure Others debate whether the carbon emissions of commuting to and from the building should also be included in the calculation Recent work in New Zealand has initiated an approach to include building user transport energy within zero energy building frameworks Net zero cost In this type of building the cost of purchasing energy is balanced by income from sales of electricity to the grid of electricity generated on-site Such a status depends on how a utility credits net electricity generation and the utility rate structure the building uses Net off-site zero energy use A building may be considered a ZEB if of the energy it purchases comes from renewable energy sources even if the energy is generated off the site Off-the-grid See also Direct current buildings Off-the-grid buildings are stand-alone ZEBs that are not connected to an off-site energy utility facility They require distributed renewable energy generation and energy storage capability for when the sun is not shining wind is not blowing etc An energy autarkic house is a building concept where the balance of the own energy consumption and production can be made on an hourly or even smaller basis Energy autarkic houses can be taken off-the-grid Net Zero Energy Building Based on scientific analysis within the joint research program Towards Net Zero Energy Solar Buildings a methodological framework was set up which allows different definitions in accordance with country s political targets specific climate conditions and respectively formulated requirements for indoor conditions The overall conceptual understanding of a Net ZEB is an energy efficient grid-connected building enabled to generate energy from renewable sources to compensate its own energy demand see figure Figure The Net ZEB balance concept balance of weighted energy import respectively energy demand x-axis and energy export feed-in credits respectively on-site generation y-axis The wording Net emphasizes the energy exchange between the building and the energy infrastructure By the building-grid interaction the Net ZEBs becomes an active part of the renewable energy infrastructure This connection to energy grids prevents seasonal energy storage and oversized on-site systems for energy generation from renewable sources like in energy autonomous buildings The similarity of both concepts is a pathway of two actions reduce energy demand by means of energy efficiency measures and passive energy use generate energy from renewable sources However the Net ZEBs grid interaction and plans to widely increase their numbers of evoking considerations on increased flexibility in the shift of energy loads and reduced peak demands Positive Energy District Expanding some of the principles of zero-energy buildings to a city district level Positive Energy Districts PED are districts or other urban areas that produce at least as much energy on an annual basis as they consume The impetus to develop whole positive energy districts instead of single buildings is based on the possibility of sharing resources managing energy efficiently systems across many buildings and reaching economics of scale Within this balancing procedure several aspects and explicit choices have to be determined The building system boundary is split into a physical boundary which determines which renewable resources are considered e g in buildings footprint on-site or even off-site respectively how many buildings are included in the balance single building cluster of buildings and a balance boundary which determines the included energy uses e g heating cooling ventilation hot water lighting appliances IT central services electric vehicles and embodied energy etc It should be noticed that renewable energy supply options can be prioritized e g by transportation or conversion effort availability over the lifetime of the building or replication potential for future etc and therefore create a hierarchy It may be argued that resources within the building footprint or on-site should be given priority over off-site supply options The weighting system converts the physical units of different energy carriers into a uniform metric site final energy source primary energy renewable parts included or not energy cost equivalent carbon emissions and even energy or environmental credits and allows their comparison and compensation among each other in one single balance e g exported PV electricity can compensate for imported biomass Politically influenced and therefore possibly asymmetrically or time-dependent conversion weighting factors can affect the relative value of energy carriers and can influence the required energy generation capacity The balancing period is often assumed to be one year suitable to cover all operation energy uses A shorter period monthly or seasonal could also be considered as well as a balance over the entire life cycle including embodied energy which could also be annualized and counted in addition to operational energy uses Figure The Net ZEB balance concept Graphical representation of the different types of balance import export balance between weighted exported and delivered energy load generation balance between weighted generation and load and monthly net balance between weighted monthly net values of generation and load The energy balance can be done in two balance types Balance of delivered imported and exported energy monitoring phase as self-consumption of energy generated on-site can be included Balance between weighted energy demand and weighted energy generation for design phase as normal end users temporal consumption patterns e g for lighting appliances etc are lacking Alternatively a balance based on monthly net values in which only residuals per month are summed up to an annual balance is imaginable This can be seen either as a load generation balance or as a special case of import export balance where a virtual monthly self-consumption is assumed see figure and compare Besides the energy balance the Net ZEBs can be characterized by their ability to match the building s load by its energy generation load matching or to work beneficially with respect to the needs of the local grid infrastructure grind interaction Both can be expressed by suitable indicators which are intended as assessment tools only Design and construction edit The most cost-effective steps toward a reduction in a building s energy consumption usually occur during the design process To achieve efficient energy use zero energy design departs significantly from conventional construction practice Successful zero energy building designers typically combine time tested passive solar or artificial fake conditioning principles that work with the on-site assets Sunlight and solar heat prevailing breezes and the cool of the earth below a building can provide daylighting and stable indoor temperatures with minimum mechanical means ZEBs are normally optimized to use passive solar heat gain and shading combined with thermal mass to stabilize diurnal temperature variations throughout the day and in most climates are superinsulated All the technologies needed to create zero energy buildings are available off-the-shelf today Sophisticated -D building energy simulation tools are available to model how a building will perform with a range of design variables such as building orientation relative to the daily and seasonal position of the sun window and door type and placement overhang depth insulation type and values of the building elements air tightness weatherization the efficiency of heating cooling lighting and other equipment as well as local climate These simulations help the designers predict how the building will perform before it is built and enable them to model the economic and financial implications on building cost benefit analysis or even more appropriate life-cycle assessment citation needed Zero-energy buildings are built with significant energy-saving features The heating and cooling loads are lowered by using high-efficiency equipment such as heat pumps rather than furnaces Heat pumps are about four times as efficient as furnaces added insulation especially in the attic and in the basement of houses high-efficiency windows such as low emissivity triple-glazed windows draft-proofing high efficiency appliances particularly modern high-efficiency refrigerators high-efficiency LED lighting passive solar gain in winter and passive shading in the summer natural ventilation and other techniques These features vary depending on climate zones in which the construction occurs Water heating loads can be lowered by using water conservation fixtures heat recovery units on waste water and by using solar water heating and high-efficiency water heating equipment In addition daylighting with skylights or solartubes can provide of daytime illumination within the home Nighttime illumination is typically done with fluorescent and LED lighting that use or less power than incandescent lights without adding unwanted heat And miscellaneous electric loads can be lessened by choosing efficient appliances and minimizing phantom loads or standby power Other techniques to reach net zero dependent on climate are Earth sheltered building principles superinsulation walls using straw-bale construction pre-fabricated building panels and roof elements plus exterior landscaping for seasonal shading citation needed Once the energy use of the building has been minimized it can be possible to generate all that energy on site using roof-mounted solar panels See examples of zero net energy houses here citation needed Zero-energy buildings are often designed to make dual use of energy including that from white goods For example using refrigerator exhaust to heat domestic water ventilation air and shower drain heat exchangers office machines and computer servers and body heat to heat the building These buildings make use of heat energy that conventional buildings may exhaust outside They may use heat recovery ventilation hot water heat recycling combined heat and power and absorption chiller units citation needed Energy harvest edit ZEBs harvest available energy to meet their electricity and heating or cooling needs By far the most common way to harvest energy is to use roof-mounted solar photovoltaic panels that turn the sun s light into electricity Energy can also be harvested with solar thermal collectors which use the sun s heat to heat water for the building Heat pumps can also harvest heat and cool from the air air-sourced or ground near the building ground-sourced otherwise known as geothermal Technically heat pumps move heat rather than harvest it but the overall effect in terms of reduced energy use and reduced carbon footprint is similar In the case of individual houses various microgeneration technologies may be used to provide heat and electricity to the building using solar cells or wind turbines for electricity and biofuels or solar thermal collectors linked to a seasonal thermal energy storage STES for space heating An STES can also be used for summer cooling by storing the cold of winter underground To cope with fluctuations in demand zero energy buildings are frequently connected to the electricity grid export electricity to the grid when there is a surplus and drawing electricity when not enough electricity is being produced Other buildings may be fully autonomous citation needed Energy harvesting is most often more effective in regards to cost and resource utilization when done on a local but combined scale for example a group of houses cohousing local district or village rather than an individual house basis An energy benefit of such localized energy harvesting is the virtual elimination of electrical transmission and electricity distribution losses On-site energy harvesting such as with roof top mounted solar panels eliminates these transmission losses entirely Energy harvesting in commercial and industrial applications should benefit from the topography of each location However a site that is free of shade can generate large amounts of solar powered electricity from the building s roof and almost any site can use geothermal or air-sourced heat pumps The production of goods under net zero fossil energy consumption requires locations of geothermal microhydro solar and wind resources to sustain the concept Zero-energy neighborhoods such as the BedZED development in the United Kingdom and those that are spreading rapidly in California and China may use distributed generation schemes This may in some cases include district heating community chilled water shared wind turbines etc There are current plans to use ZEB technologies to build entire off-the-grid or net zero energy use cities The energy harvest versus energy conservation debate edit One of the key areas of debate in zero energy building design is over the balance between energy conservation and the distributed point-of-use harvesting of renewable energy solar energy wind energy and thermal energy Most zero energy homes use a combination of these strategies citation needed As a result of significant government subsidies for photovoltaic solar electric systems wind turbines etc there are those who suggest that a ZEB is a conventional house with distributed renewable energy harvesting technologies Entire additions of such homes have appeared in locations where photovoltaic PV subsidies are significant but many so called Zero Energy Homes still have utility bills This type of energy harvesting without added energy conservation may not be cost effective with the current when price of electricity generated with photovoltaic equipment depending on the local price of power company electricity One author published the cost energy and carbon-footprint savings from conservation e g added insulation triple-glazed windows and heat pumps compared to those from on-site energy generation e g solar panels for an upgrade to an existing house Passive house developed by Western Technical College in La Crosse Wisconsin Since the s passive solar building design and passive house have demonstrated heating energy consumption reductions of to in many locations without active energy harvesting For new builds and with expert design this can be accomplished with little additional construction cost for materials over a conventional building Very few industry experts have the skills or experience to fully capture benefits of the passive design Such passive solar designs are much more cost-effective than adding expensive photovoltaic panels on the roof of a conventional inefficient building A few kilowatt-hours of photovoltaic panels costing the equivalent of about US dollars per annual kWh production may only reduce external energy requirements by to A kWh BTU high seasonal energy efficiency ratio conventional air conditioner requires over kW of photovoltaic electricity while it is operating and that does not include enough for off-the-grid night-time operation Passive cooling and superior system engineering techniques can reduce the air conditioning requirement by to Photovoltaic-generated electricity becomes more cost-effective when the overall demand for electricity is lower citation needed Combined approach in rapid retrofits for existing buildings edit Companies in Germany and the Netherlands offer rapid climate retrofit packages for existing buildings which add a custom designed shell of insulation to the outside of a building along with upgrades for more sustainable energy use such as heat pumps Similar pilot projects are underway in the US Occupant behavior edit The energy used in a building can vary greatly depending on the behavior of its occupants The acceptance of what is considered comfortable varies widely Studies of identical homes have shown dramatic differences in energy use in a variety of climates An average widely accepted ratio of highest to lowest energy consumer in identical homes is about with some identical homes using up to times as much heating energy as the others Occupant behavior can vary from differences in setting and programming thermostats varying levels of illumination and hot water use window and shading system operation and the amount of miscellaneous electric devices or plug loads used Utility concerns edit Utility companies are typically legally responsible for maintaining the electrical infrastructure that brings power to our cities neighborhoods and individual buildings Utility companies typically own this infrastructure up to the property line of an individual parcel and in some cases own electrical infrastructure on private land as well citation needed In the US utilities have expressed concern that the use of Net Metering for ZNE projects threatens the utilities base revenue which in turn impacts their ability to maintain and service the portion of the electrical grid that they are responsible for Utilities have expressed concern that states that maintain Net Metering laws may saddle non-ZNE homes with higher utility costs as those homeowners would be responsible for paying for grid maintenance while ZNE home owners would theoretically pay nothing if they do achieve ZNE status This creates potential equity issues as currently the burden would appear to fall on lower-income households A possible solution to this issue is to create a minimum base charge for all homes connected to the utility grid which would force ZNE home owners to pay for grid services independently of their electrical use citation needed Additional concerns are that local distribution as well as larger transmission grids have not been designed to convey electricity in two directions which may be necessary as higher levels of distributed energy generation come on line Overcoming this barrier could require extensive upgrades to the electrical grid however as of this is not believed to be a major problem until renewable generation reaches much higher levels of penetration Development efforts edit Wide acceptance of zero-energy building technology may require more government incentives or building code regulations the development of recognized standards or significant increases in the cost of conventional energy The Google photovoltaic campus and the Microsoft -kilowatt photovoltaic campus relied on US Federal and especially California subsidies and financial incentives California is now providing US billion in subsidies for residential-and-commercial near-zero-energy buildings The details of other American states renewable energy subsidies up to US per watt can be found in the Database of State Incentives for Renewables and Efficiency The Florida Solar Energy Center has a slide presentation on recent progress in this area The World Business Council for Sustainable Development has launched a major initiative to support the development of ZEB Led by the CEO of United Technologies and the Chairman of Lafarge the organization has both the support of large global companies and the expertise to mobilize the corporate world and governmental support to make ZEB a reality Their first report a survey of key players in real estate and construction indicates that the costs of building green are overestimated by percent Survey respondents estimated that greenhouse gas emissions by buildings are percent of the worldwide total in contrast to the actual value of roughly percent Influential zero-energy and low-energy buildings edit Those who commissioned construction of passive houses and zero-energy homes over the last three decades when were essential to iterative incremental cutting-edge technology innovations Much has been learned from many significant successes and a few expensive failures The zero-energy building concept has been a progressive evolution from other low-energy building designs Among these the Canadian R- and the German passive house standards have been internationally influential Collaborative government demonstration projects such as the superinsulated Saskatchewan House and the International Energy Agency s Task have also played their part Net zero energy building definition edit The US National Renewable Energy Laboratory NREL published a report called Net-Zero Energy Buildings A Classification System Based on Renewable Energy Supply Options This is the first report to lay out a full spectrum classification system for Net Zero Renewable Energy buildings that includes the full spectrum of Clean Energy sources both on site and off site This classification system identifies the following four main categories of Net Zero Energy Buildings Sites Campuses NZEB A A footprint renewables Net Zero Energy Building NZEB B A site renewables Net Zero Energy Building NZEB C An imported

expos of the scale of impact of applying these NREL guidelines for net zero can be seen in the graphic at Net Zero Foundation titled Net Zero Effect on U S Total Energy Use showing a possible US total fossil fuel use reduction by changing US residential and commercial buildings to net zero savings if we still use natural gas for cooking at the same level Net zero carbon conversion example edit Many well known universities have professed to want to completely convert their energy systems off of fossil fuels Capitalizing on the continuing developments in both photovoltaics and geothermal heat pump technologies and in the advancing electric battery field complete conversion to a carbon free energy solution is becoming easier Large scale hydroelectric has been around since before An example of such a project is in the Net Zero Foundation s proposal at MIT to take that campus completely off fossil fuel use This proposal shows the coming application of Net Zero Energy Buildings technologies at the District Energy scale Advantages and disadvantages edit Advantages edit isolation for building owners from future energy price increases increased comfort due to more-uniform interior temperatures this can be demonstrated with comparative isotherm maps reduced total cost of ownership due to improved energy efficiency reduced total net monthly cost of living reduced risk of loss from grid blackouts Minimal to no future energy price increases for building owners reduced requirement for energy austerity and carbon emission taxes improved reliability photovoltaic systems have -year warranties and seldom fail during weather problems the photovoltaic systems on the Walt Disney World EPCOT Energy Pavilion were still in use until even through three hurricanes They were taken down in in preparation for a new ride higher resale value as potential owners demand more ZEBs than available supply the value of a ZEB building relative to similar conventional building should increase every time energy costs increase contribute to the greater benefits of the society e g providing sustainable renewable energy to the grid reducing the need of grid expansion Optimizing bottom-up urban building energy models UBEM can make strides in the exactness of reenactment of building vitality Disadvantages edit initial costs can be higher effort required to understand apply and qualify for ZEB subsidies if they exist very few designers or builders have the necessary skills or experience to build ZEBs possible declines in future utility company renewable energy costs may lessen the value of capital invested in energy efficiency new photovoltaic solar cells equipment technology price has been falling at roughly per year It will lessen the value of capital invested in a solar electric generating system Current subsidies may be phased out as photovoltaic mass production lowers future price challenge to recover higher initial costs on resale of building but new energy rating systems are being introduced gradually while the individual house may use an average of net zero energy over a year it may demand energy at the time when peak demand for the grid occurs In such a case the capacity of the grid must still provide electricity to all loads Therefore a ZEB may not reduce risk of loss from grid blackouts without an optimized thermal envelope the embodied energy heating and cooling energy and resource usage is higher than needed ZEB by definition do not mandate a minimum heating and cooling performance level thus allowing oversized renewable energy systems to fill the energy gap solar energy capture using the house envelope only works in locations unobstructed from the sun The solar energy capture cannot be optimized in north for northern hemisphere or south for southern Hemisphere facing shade or wooded surroundings ZEB is not free of carbon emissions glass has a high embodied energy and the production requires a lot of carbon Building regulations such as height restrictions or fire code may prevent implementation of wind or solar power or external additions to an existing thermal envelope Zero energy building versus green building edit The goal of green building and sustainable architecture is to use resources more efficiently and reduce a building s negative impact on the environment Zero energy buildings achieve one key goal of exporting as much renewable energy as it uses over the course of year reducing greenhouse gas emissions ZEB goals need to be defined and set as they are critical to the design process Zero energy buildings may or may not be considered green in all areas such as reducing waste using recycled building materials etc However zero energy or net-zero buildings do tend to have a much lower ecological impact over the life of the building compared with other green buildings that require imported energy and or fossil fuel to be habitable and meet the needs of occupants citation needed Both terms zero energy buildings and green buildings have similarities and differences Green buildings often focus on operational energy and disregard the embodied carbon footprint from construction According to the IPCC embodied carbon will make up half of the total carbon emissions between now and On the other hand zero energy buildings are specifically designed to produce enough energy from renewable energy sources to meet its own consumption requirements and green buildings can be generally defined as a building that reduces negative impacts or positively impacts our natural environment -NEWUSDE There are several factors that must be considered before a building is determined to be a green building Building a green building must include an efficient use of utilities such as water and energy use of renewable energy use of recycling and reusing practices to reduce waste provide proper indoor air quality use of ethically sourced and non-toxic materials use of a design that allows the building to adapt to changing environmental climates and aspects of the design construction and operational process that address the environment and quality of life of its occupants The term green building can also be used to refer to the practice of green building which includes being resource efficient from its design to its construction to its operational processes and ultimately to its deconstruction The practice of green building differs slightly from zero energy buildings because it considers all environmental impacts such as use of materials and water pollution for example whereas the scope of zero energy buildings only includes the buildings energy consumption and ability to produce an equal amount or more of energy from renewable energy sources There are many unforeseen design challenges and site conditions required to efficiently meet the renewable energy needs of a building and its occupants as much of this technology is new Designers must apply holistic design principles and take advantage of the free naturally occurring assets available such as passive solar orientation natural ventilation daylighting thermal mass and night time cooling Designers and engineers must also experiment with new materials and technological advances striving for more affordable and efficient production A main issue in recent research regarding challenges and implementation is that there are no common standards or measures for defining and checking nearly zero energy performance D Agostino Mazzarella Zero energy building versus zero heating building edit With advances in ultra low U-value glazing a nearly zero heating building is proposed to supersede nearly-zero energy buildings in EU The zero heating building reduces on the passive solar design and makes the building more opened to conventional architectural design The zero heating building removes the need for seasonal winter utility power reserve The annual specific heating demand for the zero-heating house should not exceed kWh m a Zero heating building is simpler to design and to operate For example there is no need for modulated sun shading Certification edit The two most common certifications for green building are Passive House and LEED The goal of Passive House is to be energy efficient and reduce the use of heating cooling to below standard LEED certification is more comprehensive in regards to energy use a building is awarded credits as it demonstrates sustainable practices across a range of categories Another certification that designates a building as a net zero energy building exists within the requirements of the Living Building Challenge LBC called the Net Zero Energy Building NZEB certification provided by the International Living Future Institute ILFI The designation was developed in November as the NZEB certification but was then simplified to the Zero Energy Building Certification in Included in the list of green building certifications the BCA Green Mark rating system allows for the evaluation of buildings for their performance and impact on the environment Worldwide edit International initiatives edit This section needs to be updated Please help update this article to

Switzerland the United Kingdom and the US worked together in the joint research program called Towards Net Zero Energy Solar Buildings The program was created under the umbrella of International Energy Agency IEA Solar Heating and Cooling Program SHC Task Energy in Buildings and Communities EBC formerly ECBCS Annex with the intent of harmonizing international definition frameworks regarding net-zero and very low energy buildings by diving them into subtasks The European Union has even mandated that all new buildings must be nearly zero-energy by the end of and public buildings by However D Agostino and Mazzarella note that this directive has been applied inconsistently Some countries use primary energy consumption as the measure while others prioritize CO emissions or renewable energy input In the Paris Agreement was created under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change UNFCC with the intent of keeping the global temperature rise of the st century below degrees Celsius and limiting temperature increase to degrees Celsius by limiting greenhouse gas emissions While there was no enforced compliance countries signed the international treaty which bound developed

rapid urbanization Even with the growing increase in building infrastructure China has long been considered as a country where the overall energy demand has consistently grown less rapidly than the gross domestic product GDP of China Since the late s China has been using half as much energy as it did in but due to its dense population and rapid growth of infrastructure China has become the world s second largest energy consumer and is in a position to become the leading contributor to greenhouse gas emissions in the next century Since Chinese government has been driven by the release of new national policies to increase ZEB design standards and has also laid out a series of incentives to increase ZEB projects in China In November China s Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development MOHURD released a technical guide regarding passive and low energy green residential buildings This guide was aimed at improving energy efficiency in China s infrastructure and was also the first of its kind to be formally released as a guide for energy efficiency Also with rapid growth in ZEBs in the last three years there is an estimated influx of ZEBs to be built in China by along with the existing ZEB projects that are already built As a response to the Paris Agreement in China stated that it set a target of reducing peak carbon emissions around while also aiming to lower carbon

    "content": "Tidal barrage - Wikipedia Jump to content From Wikipedia the free encyclopedia Dam-like structure The Rance Tidal Power Station a tidal barrage in France A tidal barrage is a dam -like structure used to capture the energy from masses of water moving in and out of a bay or river due to tidal forces Instead of damming water on one side like a conventional dam a tidal barrage allows water to flow into a bay or river during high tide and releases the water during low tide This is done by measuring the tidal flow and controlling the sluice gates at key times of the tidal cycle Turbines are placed at these sluices to capture the energy as the water flows in and out Tidal barrages are among the oldest methods of tidal power generation with tide mills being developed as early as the sixth century In the s the megawatt Kislaya Guba Tidal Power Station in Kislaya Guba Russia was built Around the same time the MW la Rance Tidal Power Station was built in Brittany France opened in November La Rance was the largest tidal barrage in world for years until the MW Sihwa Lake Tidal Power Station was commissioned in South Korea in However there are few other examples worldwide Generating methods edit An artistic impression of a tidal barrage including embankments a ship lock and caissons housing a sluice and two turbines The barrage method of extracting tidal energy involves building a barrage across a bay or river that is subject to tidal flow Turbines installed in the barrage wall generate power as water flows in and out of the estuary basin bay or river These systems are similar to a hydro dam that produces static head or pressure head a height of water pressure When the water level outside of the basin or lagoon changes relative to the water level inside the turbines are able to produce power The basic elements of a barrage are caissons embankments sluices turbines and ship locks Sluices turbines and ship locks are housed in caissons very large concrete blocks Embankments seal a basin where it is not sealed by caissons The sluice gates applicable to tidal power are the flap gate vertical rising gate radial gate and rising sector Only a few such plants exist The first was the Rance Tidal Power Station on the Rance river in France which has been operating since and generates MW A larger MW plant began operation at Sihwa Lake Korea in Smaller plants include the Annapolis Royal Generating Station on the Bay of Fundy and another across a tiny inlet in Kislaya Guba Russia A number of proposals have been considered for a barrage across the River Severn from Brean Down in England to Lavernock Point near Cardiff in Wales Barrage systems are dependent on high civil infrastructure costs associated with what is in effect a dam being placed across estuarine systems As people have become more aware of environmental issues they have opposed barrages because of the adverse effects associated with changing a large ecosystem that is habitat for many varieties of species Ebb generation edit The basin is filled through the sluices until high tide Then the sluice gates are closed At this stage there may be Pumping to raise the level further The turbine gates are kept closed until the sea level falls in order to create sufficient head across the barrage The gates are opened so that the turbines generate until the head is again low Then the sluices are opened turbines disconnected and the basin is filled again The cycle repeats with the tides Ebb generation also known as outflow generation takes its name because generation occurs as the tide changes tidal direction Flood generation edit The basin is filled through the turbines which generate at tide flood This is generally much less efficient than ebb generation because the volume contained in the upper half of the basin which is where ebb generation operates is greater than the volume of the lower half filled first during flood generation Therefore the available level difference important for the turbine power produced between the basin side and the sea side of the barrage reduces more quickly than it would in ebb generation Rivers flowing into the basin may further reduce the energy potential instead of enhancing it as in ebb generation Of course this is not a problem with the lagoon model without river inflow Pumping edit Turbines are able to be powered in reverse by excess energy in the grid to increase the water level in the basin at high tide for ebb generation Much of this energy is returned during generation because power output is strongly related to the head If water is raised ft cm by pumping on a high tide of ft m this will have been raised by ft m at low tide Two-basin schemes edit Another form of energy barrage configuration is that of the dual basin type With two basins one is filled at high tide and the other is emptied at low tide Turbines are placed between the basins Two-basin schemes offer advantages over normal schemes in that generation time can be adjusted with high flexibility and it is also possible to generate almost continuously In normal estuarine situations however two-basin schemes are very expensive to construct due to the cost of the extra length of barrage There are some favourable geographies however which are well suited to this type of scheme Tidal lagoon power edit Tidal pools are independent enclosing barrages built on high level tidal estuary land that trap the high water and release it to generate power single pool around W m Two lagoons operating at different time intervals can guarantee continuous power output around W m Enhanced pumped storage tidal series of lagoons raises the water level higher than the high tide and uses intermittent renewables for pumping around W m i e km delivers MW constant output These independent barrages do not block the flow of the river Environmental impact edit The placement of a barrage into an estuary has a considerable effect on the water inside the basin and on the ecosystem Many governments have been reluctant in recent times to grant approval for tidal barrages Through research conducted on tidal plants it has been found that tidal barrages constructed at the mouths of estuaries pose similar environmental threats as large dams The construction of large tidal plants alters the flow of saltwater in and out of estuaries which changes the hydrology and salinity and could possibly harm marine mammals that use the estuaries as their habitat The La Rance plant off the Brittany coast of northern France was the first and largest tidal barrage plant in the world It is also the only site where a full-scale evaluation of the ecological impact of a tidal power system operating for years has been made French researchers found that the isolation of the estuary during the construction phases of the tidal barrage was detrimental to flora and fauna however after ten years there has been a variable degree of biological adjustment to the new environmental conditions Some species lost their habitat due to La Rance s construction but other species colonized the abandoned space which caused a shift in diversity Also as a result of the construction sandbanks disappeared the beach of St Servan was badly damaged and high-speed currents have developed near sluices which are water channels controlled by gates Turbidity edit Turbidity the amount of matter in suspension in the water decreases as a result of smaller volume of water being exchanged between the basin and the sea This lets light from the Sun penetrate the water further improving conditions for the phytoplankton The changes propagate up the food chain causing a general change in the ecosystem Tidal fences and turbines edit Tidal fences and turbines if constructed properly pose less environmental threats than tidal barrages Tidal fences and turbines like tidal stream generators rely entirely on the kinetic motion of the tidal currents and do not use dams or barrages to block channels or estuarine mouths Unlike barrages tidal fences do not interrupt fish migration or alter hydrology thus these options offer energy generating capacity without dire environmental impacts Tidal fences and turbines can have varying environmental impacts depending on whether or not fences and turbines are constructed with regard to the environment The main environmental impact of turbines is their impact on fish If the turbines are moving slowly enough such as low velocities of rpm fish kill is minimalized and silt and other nutrients are able to flow through the structures For example a kW tidal turbine prototype built in the St Lawrence Seaway in reported no fish kills Tidal fences block off channels which makes it difficult for fish and wildlife to migrate through those channels In order to reduce fish kill fences could be engineered so that the spaces between the caisson wall and the rotor foil are large enough to allow fish to pass through Larger marine mammals such as seals or dolphins can be protected from the turbines by fences or a sonar sensor auto-braking system that automatically shuts the turbines down when marine mammals are detected Salinity edit As a result of less water exchange with the sea the average salinity inside the basin decreases also affecting the ecosystem citation needed Tidal Lagoons do not suffer from this problem citation needed Sediment movements edit Estuaries often have high volume of sediments moving through them from the rivers to the sea The introduction of a barrage into an estuary may result in sediment accumulation within the barrage affecting the ecosystem and also the operation of the barrage Fish edit Fish may move through sluices safely but when these are closed fish will seek out turbines and attempt to swim through them Also some fish will be unable to escape the water speed near a turbine and will be sucked through Even with the most fish-friendly turbine design fish mortality per pass is approximately citation needed from pressure drop contact with blades cavitation etc Alternative passage technologies fish ladders fish lifts fish escalators etc have so far failed to solve this problem for tidal barrages either offering extremely expensive solutions or ones which are used by a small fraction of fish only Research in sonic guidance of fish is ongoing citation needed The Open-Centre turbine reduces this problem allowing fish to pass through the open centre of the turbine Recently a run of the river type turbine has been developed in France This is a very large slow rotating Kaplan-type turbine mounted on an angle Testing for fish mortality has indicated fish mortality figures to be less than This concept also seems very suitable for adaption to marine current tidal turbines Energy calculations edit The energy available from a barrage is dependent on the volume of water The potential energy contained in a volume of water is E A g h displaystyle E tfrac A rho g h where h is the vertical tidal range A is the horizontal area of the barrage basin is the density of water kg per cubic meter seawater varies between and kg per cubic meter and g is the acceleration due to the Earth s gravity meters per second squared The factor half is due to the fact that as the basin flows empty through the turbines the hydraulic head over the dam reduces The maximum head is only available at the moment of low water assuming the high water level is still present in the basin Example calculation of tidal power generation edit Assumptions The tidal range of tide at a particular place is feet m approx The surface of the tidal energy harnessing plant is km km km m m million m Density of sea water kg m Mass of the sea water volume of sea

Suitable locations are found in Russia the US Canada Australia Korea and the UK Amplitudes of up to m ft occur for example in the Bay of Fundy where tidal resonance amplifies the tidal range Economics edit Tidal barrage power schemes have a high capital cost and a very low running cost As a result a tidal power scheme may not produce returns for many years and investors may be reluctant to participate in such projects It reportedly took around years to recoup the m costs of building the Rance Tidal Power Plant As of update it has been operating for years with the cost of tidal power lower than nuclear or solar so it has more than paid back the construction costs Governments may be able to finance tidal barrage power but many are unwilling to do so also due to the lag time before investment return and the high irreversible commitment For example the energy policy of the United Kingdom recognizes the role of tidal energy and expresses the need for local councils to understand the broader national goals of renewable energy in approving tidal projects The UK government itself appreciates the technical viability and siting options available but has failed to provide meaningful incentives to move these goals forward See also edit List of tidal barrages List of tidal power stations Marine energy Tethys a database on potential environmental effects of marine and

    "content": "Tidal farm - Wikipedia Jump to content From Wikipedia the free encyclopedia Group of tidal stream generators used for production of electric power Sea Bed Turbine A tidal farm is a group of tidal stream generators used for production of electric power The potential of tidal farms is limited by the number of suitable sites across the globe as there are niche requirements to make a tidal farm cost effective and environmentally conscious Research and development edit Tidal farms are a relatively new form of renewable energy There is a lot of investment going into the development of tidal farms as well as looking at their long term impacts and use cases In a tidal farm was installed miles off of the coast of Brittany France It was designed to demonstrate the potential of connected tidal turbines However the project failed in due to corrosion and both turbines have been removed In Iran there has been interest in development of tidal stream energy due to its stability Faculty of Civil Engineering at the university of Tarbiat Modares University have identified potential sites of interest for these farms Locations include the Persian Gulf the Oman Sea Khowran Straight Hengam Island and Greater Tunb Island Cost of energy power output tariff rates and expected return on investments have also been factors analyzed and studied by the university research group In the Bristol Channel there has been research on the potential environmental impacts of tidal farms The study concluded that the proper environmental evaluation needs to be done for each site Technology edit A mathematical optimization approach is used to design turbine farm layouts These models are used to determine if a potential site has suitable geography a minimal environmental impact and is economically viable Through research and development factors such as the number of turbines location of turbines and overall farm profit could be accurately tested and predicted Tidal Farms utilize tidal stream generators that are grouped together to produce electricity These generators use the moving tides to turn turbines that are very similar to the wind turbines used on land The power of the ocean and the turbine s advanced technology guarantee a much more predictable energy output than regular wind turbines The turbines are usually located in areas with high tidal activity in order for the generators to be as efficient as possible What makes tidal farms unique is that they are set up in groups to allow much more energy production The generators are connected to substations on shore to transform voltage from high to low or low to high These generators can be semi-submersible or fixed into the sea floor The turbines that would be used would be very slow moving due to the density of the water this is very beneficial to aquatic life because fish would be able to freely pass through without being in danger of dying Some turbines can also be used in irrigation canals rivers and dam whether the flow of water is fast or slow Leaders in Practice edit Scotland is one of the main leaders in the effort to utilize tidal energy as an alternative energy resource In Scottish Power installed a ft turbine off of the Orkney Islands after preliminary testing of the new technology Today Scotland continues to lead the world in tidal farms Scottish company Orbital Marine Power boasts the powerful tidal turbines including a major project off of the coast of the Orkney The Orbital O turbine can generate MW of energy and was installed in The company Ocean Flow used Siemens technology to design a semi-submersible turbine The models created have proven to be able to withstand sea conditions excellently The company claims its model creates less disturbances to its surrounding ecosystem and costs less to deploy A key feature to this model s set up is the platform that the turbine rests on It was developed at Newcastle University School of Marine Science and Technology in The Platform is suitable to withstand harsh conditions in deep depth of the ocean Senior development engineer at Ocean Flow Mark Knos commented on the project and stated that they had created a th scale model to test and a scale model as well Both models were tested and have provided promising results Tidal Farm Generation in North America edit North America has fewer tidal power stations than any other comparable geographical area in terms of GDP or population Tidal power has been estimated to be able to account for fifteen percent of the United States power consumption if harnessed correctly The first tidal installation in North America to connect to a power grid was laid down in in Cobscook Bay Maine by the Ocean Renewable Power Company The preliminary device generates Kilowatts at full capacity Plans to install two more devices were shelved as of Tidal generators were installed in by OpenHydro and Emera the Bay of Fundy These tidal generators suffered damage losing several blades in the process due to the powerful tides in the Bay In the autumn of a joint venture by the same two companies successfully placed a -Megawatt tidal generator in the Bay of Fundy of which Cobscook Bay is a constituent area The successful integration of the new tidal generators to local power stations and the connected power grid supplies an estimated to homes per day Types edit Semi Submersible Turbines is a more expensive turbine but in the long run it is cheaper and is more cost efficient The turbines are connecting to a stationary post and the turbine generator can be raised and lowered anytime for maintenance Horizontal Axis Turbines closely resemble wind turbines The blades spin around a central axis that is parallel to the direction of flow The blades on a Vertical Axis Turbine rotate around a central axis that is perpendicular to the direction of flow and is typically suspended from the surface of the water One advantage of this model is the efficacy regardless of the direction of movement of the water Oscillating Generators have a hydrofoil attached to a lever arm which rises and falls as the water moves over it Tidal Kites are a type of generator that a fastened to the ocean floor with a cable and allowed a large range of motion to move in the water Archimedes screw generators spin as the water moves through the shape of the screw They are particularly effective in tidal areas with lower water levels Problems edit One of the few environmental unknowns about tidal farms is the threat they may pose to the plant life in the areas that the turbines would be set up But by having the blades turn at a slower than normal speed wind turbines can eliminate some of the potential environmental problems Another problem that can occur is making the turbines water tight to prevent seawater from corrosion the metal parts inside the turbine Cost edit One of the major drawbacks of tidal farms at the moment is the relatively high cost compared to other forms of renewable energy The electricity produced by tidal farms can cost anywhere from to times more than wind energy Tidal farms are also currently accompanied by a high investment cost Due to the unique characteristics of each site extensive research and optimization needs to go into the design of each turbine array to maximize the potential power output Some of the main factors that can vary from site to site include depth the slope of the ocean floor and speed of the water s flow These natural factors have an impact on the type of generator used and how they are arranged Another cost associated with tidal farms is maintenance While most maintenance is routine and carried out one or twice a year emergency maintenance can become costly if large machinery such as a crane needs to be used to fix a failure Effects on ocean geography and tidal patterns edit This section possibly contains original research Please improve it

possible environmental and ecological changes to the environment they are placed in The structures of these farms produce changes in tidal patterns sediment flow and water column turbulence Tidal patterns can be affected in different ways depending on the structure of the farm itself The structure is referring to the size and cross-sectional area because the number of blades or the load that is put on the farm doesn t make much of a difference on the overall height of the water These effects can be seen to lower both the high tide and low tides which means that the water level will be lower in total The number of blades and load on the system however does affect the tidal range vastly Tidal range can be reduced up to with observations of the densest farms which can cause destruction to of the areas around them but it can be controlled Damage can be reduced to by using a two-rotor spaced turbine and only with five-rotor spaced turbines This is done by spreading the water s work over a large surface area on the turbine itself to mitigate the alteration of the flow in the water column Sediment flow is affected by the introduction of tidal farms to an area Not only does it create turbulence that moves the sediment but it changes the ecosystem around it By moving more sediment into areas that didn t gain much before places like grass beds could be wiped out by being covered in sediment The geography on the ocean floor would be changed by the new sediment flow patterns because of the new turbulence New things like sandbars could form around the farms causing even more of an impact to the surrounding environment by influencing more changes than originally expected The water column also faces multiple chances since the force it transfers through turbulence is being absorbed by the tidal farms Waves would be directly affected by the reduced energy behind the water causing them to be weaker which too could destroy multiple ecosystems There would also be an effect on the inter-tidal zones with there being less turbulence which many species like fish and crabs use for sustenance and survival Other things like noise and electromagnetic fields also pose problems for the environment but not to the scale that the last effects had on the geography and life in an ecosystem Effects on ecology edit This section possibly contains original research Please improve it by verifying the claims made and adding inline citations Statements consisting only of original research should be removed June Learn how and when to remove this message The prime placement of tidal farms occurs in tidal barrages marshes lagoons and other intertidal bodies of waters most commonly home to migratory wetland birds The placement of tidal farms raises the water levels to a point where the feeding areas of the birds are submerged With the loss of feeding areas mortality rates increase Furthermore studies were conducted by University of Exeter faculty for wetland birds in the Solway Firth UK These studies concluded that the effect of certain types of tidal farms are negligible The impacts of tidal farms on water foul habitats in the Solway Firth were found to be relatively low even for the largest case The study highlighted that current installations with similar capacities as the simulations had a lower loss of intertidal area than that of its computer-generated counterpart One conclusion reached was that future studies should focus on the vulnerability of an individual species as compared to the effect on maritime birds as a whole The construction of tidal barrages within a bay inlet or estuary is one of the few cases where inter species relations were universally affected The retention of tidal water alters the timetable of species which dominate the upper to intermediate shore habitats Simultaneously the lower shore remains submerged for longer periods of time The resulting forced ecosystem is disruptive to the majority of species present with the exception of fish whom are tidal feeders The extended periods of high tide allow for greater foraging opportunity hence a growth in population can be observed in these cases The structures of larger tidal barrages alter the scour and deposition in their respective habitats Scour and deposition refers to the movement and exchange of sediment along the floor of a water body The U S Army Engineer Research and Development Center in Vicksburg Mississippi stated that the interruption of natural sediment deposits directly led to an increased mortality rate of seabed grass as the shoot could not properly grow in the altered seafloor This would be even more devastating for benthic life which resides under the ocean floor since they are easily affected by changes in the flow over the bottom of the ocean It would be hard to prevent this too since these organisms aren t easily relocated since they are so sensitive to changes in their atmosphere See also

Sustainability Purpose To transition from fossil-based energy systems to renewable and low-carbon energy sources Progress of current energy transition to renewable energy Fossil fuels such as coal oil and natural gas still remain the world s primary energy sources even as renewables are increasing in use An energy transition or energy system transformation is a major structural change to energy supply and consumption in an energy system Currently a transition to sustainable energy is underway to limit climate change Most of the sustainable energy is renewable energy Therefore another term for energy transition is renewable energy transition The current transition aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from energy quickly and sustainably mostly by phasing-down fossil fuels and changing as many processes as possible to operate on low carbon electricity A previous energy transition perhaps took place during the Industrial Revolution from onwards from wood and other biomass to coal followed by oil and later natural gas Over three-quarters of the world s energy needs are met by burning fossil fuels but this usage emits greenhouse gases Energy production and consumption are responsible for most human-caused greenhouse gas emissions To meet the goals of the Paris Agreement on climate change emissions must be reduced as soon as possible and reach net-zero by mid-century Since the late s the renewable energy transition has also been driven by the rapidly falling cost of both solar and wind power After clean energy is cheaper than ever Global solar module prices fell percent to less than cents kWh EV batteries saw their best price decline in seven years Another benefit of the energy transition is its potential to reduce the health and environmental impacts of the energy industry Heating of buildings is being electrified with heat pumps being the most efficient technology by far To improve the flexibility of electrical grids the installation of energy storage and super grids are vital to enable the use of variable weather-dependent technologies However fossil-fuel subsidies are slowing the energy transition Definition edit An energy transition is a broad shift in technologies and behaviours that are needed to replace one source of energy with another A prime example is the change from a pre-industrial system relying on traditional biomass wind water and muscle power to an industrial system characterized by pervasive mechanization steam power and the use of coal The IPCC does not define energy transition in the glossary of its Sixth Assessment Report but it does define transition as The process of changing from one state or condition to another in a given period of time Transition can occur in individuals firms cities regions and nations

After the oil crisis the term energy transition was coined by politicians and media It was popularised by US President Jimmy Carter in his Address on the Nation on Energy calling to look back into history to understand our energy problem Twice in the last several hundred years there has been a transition in the way people use energy Because we are now running out of gas and oil we must prepare quickly for a third change to strict conservation and to the renewed use of coal and to permanent renewable energy sources like solar power The term was later globalised after the second oil shock during the United Nations Conference on New and Renewable Sources of Energy From the s debates on energy transition have increasingly taken climate change mitigation into account Parties to the agreement committed to limit global warming to well below C preferably C compared to pre-industrial levels This requires a rapid energy transition with a downshift of fossil fuel production to stay within the carbon emissions budget Example of Distributed generation use of renewable energies Agricultural business with biogas plant and photovoltaic roof In this context the term energy transition encompasses a reorientation of energy policy This could imply a shift from centralized to distributed generation It also includes attempts to replace overproduction and avoidable energy consumption with energy-saving measures and increased efficiency The historical transitions from locally supplied wood water and wind energies to globally supplied fossil and nuclear fuels has induced growth in end-use demand through the rapid expansion of engineering research education and standardisation The mechanisms for the whole-systems changes include new discipline in Transition Engineering amongst all engineering professions entrepreneurs researchers and educators However it has been argued that the term is a mere slogan and that rather than transitioning as of use of all forms of primary energy has increased Examples of past energy transitions edit Over centuries energy consumption has evolved from burning wood to fossil fuels coal oil natural gas and in recent decades to using nuclear hydroelectric and other renewable energy sources Historic approaches to past energy transitions are shaped by two main discourses One argues that humankind experienced several energy transitions in its past while the other suggests the term energy additions as better reflecting the changes in global energy supply in the last three centuries The chronologically first discourse was most broadly described by Vaclav Smil It underlines the change in the energy mix of countries and the global economy By looking at data in percentages of the primary energy source used in a given context it paints a picture of the world s energy systems as having changed significantly over time going from biomass to coal to oil and now a mix of mostly coal oil and natural gas Until the s the economic mechanism behind energy systems was local rather than global The second discourse was most broadly described by Jean-Baptiste Fressoz It emphasises that the term energy transition was first used by politicians not historians to describe a goal to achieve in the future not as a concept to analyse past trends When looking at the sheer amount of energy being used by humankind the picture is one of ever-increasing consumption of all the main energy sources available to humankind For instance the increased use of coal in the th century did not replace wood consumption indeed more wood was burned Another example is the deployment of passenger cars in the th century This evolution triggered an increase in both oil consumption to drive the car and coal consumption to make the steel needed for the car In other words according to this approach humankind never performed a single energy transition in its history but performed several energy additions Contemporary energy transitions differ in terms of motivation and objectives drivers and governance As development progressed different national systems became more and more integrated becoming the large international systems seen today Historical changes of energy systems have been extensively studied While historical energy changes were generally protracted affairs unfolding over many decades this does not necessarily hold true for the present energy transition which is unfolding under very different policy and technological conditions For current energy systems many lessons can be learned from history obsolete source dubious discuss The need for large amounts of firewood in early industrial processes in combination with prohibitive costs for overland transportation led to a scarcity of accessible e g affordable wood and eighteenth century glass-works operated like a forest clearing enterprise When Britain had to resort to coal after largely having run out of wood the resulting fuel crisis triggered a chain of events that two centuries later culminated in the Industrial Revolution Similarly increased use of peat and coal were vital elements paving the way for the Dutch Golden Age roughly spanning the entire th century Another example where resource depletion triggered technological innovation and a shift to new energy sources is th century whaling whale oil eventually became replaced by kerosene and other petroleum-derived products To speed up the energy transition it is also conceivable that there will be government buyouts or bailouts of coal mining regions Drivers for current energy transition edit Drivers for transition to renewable energy With increasing adoption of renewable energy sources costs have declined most notably for energy generated by solar panels Levelized cost of energy LCOE is a measure of the average net present cost of electricity generation for a generating plant over its lifetime Deaths caused as a result of fossil fuel electricity generation areas of rectangles in chart greatly exceed those resulting from production of renewable energy rectangles barely visible in chart Climate change mitigation and co-benefits edit Further information Climate change mitigation Co-benefits A rapid energy transition to very-low or zero-carbon sources is required to mitigate the effects of climate change Coal oil and gas combustion account for of CO emissions and still provide of primary energy consumption Despite the knowledge about the risks of climate change and the increasing number of climate policies adopted since the s however energy transitions have not accelerated towards decarbonization beyond historical trends and remain far off track in achieving climate targets The deployment of renewable energy can generate co-benefits of climate change mitigation positive socio-economic effects on employment industrial development health and energy access Depending on the country and the deployment scenario replacing coal power plants can more than double the number of jobs per average MW capacity The energy transition could create many green jobs for example in Africa The costs for retraining workers for the renewable energy industry was found to be trivial for both coal in the U S and oil sands in Canada The latter of which would only demand of federal provincial and territorial oil and gas subsidies for a single year to be reallocated to provide oil and gas workers with a new career of approximately equivalent pay In non-electrified rural areas the deployment of solar mini-grids can significantly improve electricity access Employment opportunities by the green transition are associated with the use of renewable energy sources or building activity for infrastructure improvements and renovations Energy security edit Another important driver is energy security and independence with increasing importance in Europe and Taiwan because of the Russian invasion of Ukraine Unlike Europe s s dependence on Russian gas even if China stops supplying solar panels those already installed continue generating electricity Militaries are using and developing electric vehicles particularly for their stealthiness but not tanks As of renewable energy in Taiwan is far too small to help in a blockade Centralised facilities such as oil refineries and thermal power plants can be put out of action by air attack whereas although solar can be attacked decentralised power such as solar and wind may be less vulnerable Solar and batteries reduces risky fuel convoys However large hydropower plants are vulnerable Some say that nuclear power plants are unlikely to be military targets but others conclude that civil NPPs in war zones can be weaponised and exploited by the hostile forces not only for impeding energy supplies and thus shattering the public morale of the adversary but also for blackmailing and coercing the decisionmakers of the attacked state and their international allies with a vision of man-made nuclear disaster Economic development edit For many developing economies for example in the mineral-rich countries of Sub-Saharan Africa the transition to renewable energies is predicted to become a driver of sustainable economic development The International Energy Agency IEA has identified minerals as critical for clean energy technologies and estimates that by global demand for these will increase by per cent need quotation to verify Africa has large reserves of many of these so-called green minerals such as bauxite cobalt copper chromium manganese and graphite The African Union has outlined a policy framework the Africa Mining Vision to leverage the continent s mineral reserves in pursuit of sustainable development and socio-economic transformation Achieving these goals requires mineral-rich African economies to transition from commodity export to manufacture of higher value-added products Cost competitiveness of renewable energies edit From to the competitiveness of wind and solar power substantially increased Unit costs of solar energy dropped sharply by wind energy by and lithium-ion batteries by This has made wind and solar power the cheapest form for new installations in many regions Levelized costs for combined onshore wind or solar with storage for a few hours are already lower than for gas peaking power plants In the new electricity generating capacity of renewables exceeded of all installed power Key technologies and approaches edit Further information Sustainable energy Energy system transformation The emissions reductions necessary to keep global warming below C will require a system-wide transformation of the way energy is produced distributed stored and consumed For a society to replace one form of energy with another multiple technologies and behaviours in the energy system must change Many climate change mitigation pathways envision three main aspects of a low-carbon energy system The use of low-emission energy sources to produce electricity Electrification that is increased use of electricity instead of directly burning fossil fuels Accelerated adoption of energy efficiency measures Renewable energy edit Main article Renewable energy Examples of renewable energy options concentrated solar power with molten salt heat storage in Spain wind energy in South Africa the Three Gorges Dam on the Yangtze River in China biomass energy plant in Scotland Investment By investment in the energy transition had grown to about twice that for fossil fuels oil natural gas and coal Growth in capacity Renewable energy sources provide an increasing share of overall power capacity Renewable energy capacity has steadily grown led by solar photovoltaic power In electricity generation from wind and solar sources was projected to exceed by as fossil fuels use continues to decline Rechargeable battery prices for electric vehicles fell given economies of scale and new cell chemistries improving energy density However general inflationary pressures and rising costs of raw materials and components inhibited price declines in the early s The most important energy sources in the low carbon energy transition are wind power and solar power They could reduce net emissions by billion tons CO equivalent per year each half of it with lower net lifetime costs than the reference Other renewable energy sources include bioenergy geothermal energy and tidal energy but they currently have higher net lifetime costs By hydroelectricity is the largest source of renewable electricity in the world providing of the world s total electricity in However because of its heavy dependence on geography and the generally high environmental and social impact of hydroelectric power plants the growth potential of this technology is limited Wind and solar power are considered more scalable but still require vast quantities of land and materials They have higher potential for growth These sources have grown nearly exponentially in recent decades thanks to rapidly decreasing costs In wind power supplied worldwide electricity while solar power supplied In the world reached over clean electricity While production from most types of hydropower plants can be actively controlled production from wind and solar power depends on the weather Electrical grids must be extended and adjusted to avoid wastage Dammed hydropower is a dispatchable source while solar and wind are variable renewable energy sources These sources require dispatchable backup generation or energy storage to provide continuous and reliable electricity For this reason storage technologies also play a key role in the renewable energy transition As of the largest scale storage technology is pumped storage hydroelectricity accounting for the great majority of energy storage capacity installed worldwide Other important forms of energy storage are electric batteries and power to gas The Electricity Grids and Secure Energy Transitions report by the IEA emphasizes the necessity of increasing grid investments to over billion annually by up from billion to accommodate the integration of renewable energy By the grid must expand by more than million kilometers to manage renewable sources which are projected to account for over of the global power capacity increase over the next two decades Failure to enhance grid infrastructure timely could lead to an additional gigatonnes of carbon dioxide emissions by significantly risking a C global temperature rise Integration of variable renewable energy sources edit Main article Variable renewable energy See also Combined cycle hydrogen power plant and Hydrogen fuel cell power plant With the integration of renewable energy local electricity production is becoming more variable It has been recommended that coupling sectors energy storage smart grids demand side management sustainable biofuels hydrogen electrolysis and derivatives will ultimately be needed to accommodate large shares of renewables in energy systems Fluctuations can be smoothened by combining wind and sun power and by extending electricity grids over large areas This reduces the dependence on local weather conditions With highly variable prices electricity storage and grid extension become more competitive Researchers have found that costs for accommodating the integration of variable renewable energy sources in electricity systems are expected to be modest until Furthermore it will be more challenging to supply the entire energy system with renewable energy Fast fluctuations increase with a high integration of wind and solar energy They can be addressed by operating reserves Large-scale batteries can react within seconds and are increasingly used to keep the electricity grid stable renewable energy edit This section is an excerpt from renewable energy edit renewable energy is the goal of using fully renewable resources for all electric energy consumption renewable energy for electricity heating cooling and transport is motivated by climate change pollution and other environmental issues as well as economic and energy security concerns Shifting the total global primary energy supply to renewable sources requires a transition of the energy system since most of today s energy is derived from non-renewable fossil fuels Research into this topic is fairly new with few studies published before but has gained increasing attention in recent years A cross-sectoral holistic approach is seen as an important feature of renewable energy systems and is based on the assumption that the best solutions can be found only if one focuses on the synergies between the sectors of the energy system such as electricity heat transport or industry Nuclear power edit Timeline of commissioned and decommissioned nuclear capacity since the s Main article Nuclear power In the s and s nuclear power gained a large share in some countries In France and Slovakia more than half of the electrical power is still nuclear It is a low carbon energy source but comes with risks and increasing costs Since the late s deployment has slowed down Decommissioning increases as many reactors are close to the end of their lifetime or long before because of anti-nuclear sentiments Germany stopped its last three nuclear power plants by mid April On the other hand the China General Nuclear Power Group is aiming for GW by produced by additional reactors Electrification edit Further information Sustainable energy Electrification With the switch to clean energy sources where power is generated via electricity end uses of energy such as transportation and heating need to be electrified to run on these clean energy sources Concurrent with this switch is an expansion of the grid to handle larger amounts of generated electricity to supply to these end uses Two key areas of electrification are electric vehicles and heat pumps It is easier to sustainably produce electricity than it is to sustainably produce liquid fuels citation needed Therefore adoption of electric vehicles is a way to make transport more sustainable While electric vehicle technology is relatively mature in road transport electric shipping and aviation are still early in their development hence sustainable liquid fuels may have a larger role to play in these sectors A key sustainable solution to heating is electrification heat pumps or the less efficient electric heater The IEA estimates that heat pumps currently provide only of space and water heating requirements globally but could provide over Use of ground source heat pumps not only reduces total annual energy loads associated with heating and cooling it also flattens the electric demand curve by eliminating the extreme summer peak electric supply requirements However heat pumps and resistive heating alone will not be sufficient for the electrification of industrial heat This because in several processes higher temperatures are required which cannot be achieved with these types of equipment For example for the production of ethylene via steam cracking temperatures as high as C are required Hence drastically new processes are required Nevertheless power-to-heat is expected to be the first step in the electrification of the chemical industry with an expected large-scale implementation by Economic and geopolitical aspects edit See also Economics of climate change mitigation Energy independence Energy security and renewable technology and Russia in the European energy sector Countries that managed to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions working towards a low-carbon economy while still growing their economy This is called eco-economic decoupling A shift in energy sources has the potential to redefine relations and dependencies between countries stakeholders and companies Countries or land owners with resources fossil or renewable face massive losses or gains depending on the development of any energy transition In energy costs reached of global gross domestic product Global rivalries have contributed to the driving forces of the economics behind the low carbon energy transition Technological innovations developed within a country have the potential to become an economic force Influences edit Acceptance of wind and solar facilities in one s community is stronger among Democrats blue while acceptance of nuclear power plants is stronger among Republicans red The energy transition discussion is heavily influenced by contributions from the fossil fuel industries One way that oil companies are able to continue their work despite growing environmental social and economic concerns is by lobbying local and national governments Historically the fossil fuel lobby has been highly successful in limiting regulations From to Exxon Mobil one of the largest oil companies in the world spent nearly million in anti-climate change lobbying and providing misleading information about climate change to the general public The fossil fuel industry acquires significant support through the existing banking and investment structure The concept that the industry should no longer be financially supported has led to the social movement known as divestment Divestment is defined as the removal of investment capital from stocks bonds or funds in oil coal and gas companies for both moral and financial reasons Banks investing firms governments universities institutions and businesses are all being challenged with this new moral argument against their existing investments in the fossil fuel industry and many such as Rockefeller Brothers Fund the University of California New York City and more have begun making the shift to more sustainable eco-friendly investments In the International Renewable Energy Agency IRENA projected that by over half of the world s energy will be carried by electricity and over three-quarters of the global energy mix will be from renewables Although overtaken by both biomass and clean hydrogen fossil fuels were still projected to supply of energy The transition is expected to reshape geopolitical power by reducing reliance on long-distance fossil fuel trade and enhancing the importance of regional energy markets Social and environmental aspects edit Impacts edit See also Just transition A renewable energy transition can present negative social impacts for some people who rely on the existing energy economy or who are affected by mining for minerals required for the transition This has led to calls for a just transition which the IPCC defines as A set of principles processes and practices that aim to ensure that no people workers places sectors countries or regions are left behind in the transition from a high-carbon to a low carbon economy Use of local energy sources may stabilise and stimulate some local economies create opportunities for energy trade between communities states and regions need quotation to verify and increase energy security Coal mining is economically important in some regions and a transition to renewables would decrease its viability and could have severe impacts on the communities that rely on this business Not only do these communities face energy poverty already need quotation to verify but they also face economic collapse when the coal mining businesses move elsewhere or disappear altogether This broken system perpetuates the poverty and vulnerability that decreases the adaptive capacity of coal mining communities Potential mitigation could include expanding the program base clarification needed for vulnerable communities to assist with new training programs opportunities for economic development and subsidies to assist with the transition Increasing energy prices resulting from an energy transition may negatively impact developing countries including Vietnam and Indonesia Increased mining for lithium cobalt nickel copper and other critical minerals needed for expansion of renewable energy infrastructure has created increased environmental conflict and environmental justice issues for some communities Labour edit A large portion of the global workforce works directly or indirectly for the fossil fuel economy need quotation to verify Moreover many other industries are currently dependent on unsustainable energy sources such as the steel industry or cement and concrete industry Transitioning these workforces during the rapid period of economic change requires considerable forethought and planning The international labor movement has advocated for a just transition that addresses these concerns citation needed Recently an energy crisis is upon the nations of Europe as a result of dependence on Russia s natural gas which was cut off during the Russia-Ukraine war This goes to show that humanity is still heavily dependent on fossil fuel energy sources and care should be taken to have a smooth transition less energy-shortage shocks cripple the very efforts to effectively energise the transition citation needed Risks and barriers edit See also Renewable energy Debates Amongst the key issues to consider in relation to the pace of the global transition to renewables is how well individual electric companies are able to adapt to the changing reality of the power sector For example to date the uptake of renewables by electric utilities has remained slow hindered by their continued investment in fossil fuel generation capacity Incomplete regulations on clean energy uptake and concerns about electricity shortages have been identified as key barriers to the energy transition in coal-dependent fast developing economies such as Vietnam Researchers found that social sentiments held by U S residents have proven to be barriers for energy transitions The U S Department of Energy plans for wind energy to provide of the electrical grid by are bringing wind energy projects closer to communities Sentiments for wind energy opposition in local communities include sound annoyance perceived health effects and the reduction of scenic landscapes and views Anticipated economic aspects are believed to be the most influential variable to perceptions of proposed wind energy developments Economic barriers to acceptance of renewable energy include local tax increases increase in electricity rates decrease in tourism property value impacts and distributional inequality However rural economic development creation of jobs investment opportunities and lower electricity costs stand as possible benefits Examples by country edit Global energy consumption by source raw quantities Global energy consumption by source percent share From to coal was the source of energy with the total largest growth The use of oil and natural gas also had considerable growth followed by hydropower and renewable energy Renewable energy grew at a rate faster than any other time in history during this period The demand for nuclear energy decreased partly in reaction to a number of high-profile accidents Three Mile Island in Chernobyl in and Fukushima in but also due to the rising cost of nuclear energy which has made it more expensive than all utility scale alternatives More recently consumption of coal has declined relative to low carbon energy Coal dropped from about of the global total primary energy consumption in to in and non-hydro renewables were up to about from needs update Asia edit China edit This section is an excerpt from Energy policy of China edit This article needs to be updated Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information April Most energy in China comes from coal Development of carbon dioxide emissions in China The MW Three Gorges Dam hydroelectric power plant in China the largest hydroelectric power station in the world The People s Republic of China is both the world s largest energy consumer and the largest industrial country China is currently the world s largest emitter of greenhouse gases and coal in China is a major cause of global warming China is also the world s largest renewable energy producer and the largest producer of hydroelectricity solar power and wind power in the world The energy policy of China is connected to its industrial policy where the goals of China s industrial production dictate its energy demand management Being a country that depends heavily on foreign petroleum import for both domestic consumption and as raw materials for light industry manufacturing electrification is a huge component of the Chinese national energy policy The Fourteenth Five-Year Plan placed increased emphasis on the green transition as essential to China s pursuit of high-quality and sustainable growth India edit India has set renewable energy goals to transition of its total energy consumption into renewable sources in the Paris climate accords As of the Central Electricity Authority are well on track of achieving their goals producing GW electricity from clean sources like solar wind hydro power and nuclear power plants this is of its total capacity India is ranked third on Ernst and Young s renewable energy country attractive index behind the US and China Hydro electric power plants are a major part of India s energy infrastructure since the days of its independence in Former prime Minister Jawahar Lal Nehru called them the temples of modern India and believed them to be key drivers of modernity and industrialism for the nascent republic Notable examples of hydro power stations include the MW Tehri hydropower complex the MW Koyna hydroelectric project and the MW Srisailam Dam Recently India has given due importance to emerging renewable technologies like solar power plants and wind farms They house of the world s top solar farms including world s largest MW Bhadla Solar Park in and world s second-largest solar park of MW Pavgada Solar Park and MW Kurnool Ultra mega solar park While there has been positive change air pollution from coal still kills many people and India has to cut down its reliance on traditional coal based power production as it still accounts for around of its energy production India is also moving towards its goal for electrification of the automotive industry aiming to have at least EV ownership among private vehicles by Vietnam edit Vietnam has led the Southeast Asia in solar and wind uptake achieving about GW in from almost zero in Thailand has the highest number of EV registrations with in The energy transition in Southeast Asia can be summarized as Challenging achievable and interdependent This implies that while there are obstacles feasibility largely relies on international support Public demand for improved local environmental quality and government s aims to promote a green economy are found to be key drivers in Vietnam Governments ambition to attract international support for green growth initiatives and public demand for a clean environment have been found to be drivers of the energy transition in developing countries such as Vietnam Thanks to a relatively more conducive investment environment Vietnam is poised to a faster energy transition than some other ASEAN members Europe edit European Union edit Main article European Green Deal The European Green Deal is a set of policy initiatives by the European Commission with the overarching aim of making Europe climate neutral in An impact assessed plan will also be presented to increase the EU s greenhouse gas emission reductions target for to at least and towards compared with levels The plan is to review each existing law on its climate merits and also introduce new legislation on the circular economy building renovation biodiversity farming and innovation The president of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen stated that the European Green Deal would be Europe s man on the Moon moment as the plan would make Europe the first climate-neutral continent A survey found that digitally advanced companies put more money into energy-saving strategies In the European Union of companies that have made investments in both basic and advanced technologies have also invested in energy efficiency measures compared to only of US firms in the same category Overall there is a significant disparity between businesses digital profiles and investments in energy efficiency Germany edit Main article Energiewende Gross generation of electricity by source in Germany Germany has played an outsized role in the transition away from fossil fuels and nuclear power to renewables The energy transition in Germany is known as die Energiewende literally the energy turn indicating a turn away from old fuels and technologies to new one The key policy document outlining the Energiewende was published by the German government in September some six months before the Fukushima nuclear accident legislative support was passed in September The policy has been embraced by the German federal government and has resulted in a huge expansion of renewables particularly wind power Germany s share of renewables has increased from around in to in reaching close to the OECD average of usage of renewables In Germany has a share of and surpassed the OECD average A large driver for this increase in the shares of renewables energy are decreases in cost of capital Germany boasts some of the lowest cost of capitals for renewable solar and wind onshore energy worldwide In the International Renewable Energy Agency reported capital costs of around and for solar and wind onshore This constitutes a significant decrease from previous numbers in the early s where capital costs hovered around and respectively This decrease in capital costs was influenced by a variety of economic and political drivers Following the financial crisis Germany eased the refinancing regulations on banks by giving out cheap loans with low interest rates in order to stimulate the economy again During this period the industry around renewable energies also started to experience learning effects in manufacturing project organisation as well as financing thanks to rising investment and order volumes This coupled with various forms of subsidies contributed to a large reduction of the capital cost and the levelized cost of electricity LCOE for solar and onshore wind power As the technologies have matured and become integral parts of the existing sociotechnical systems it is to be expected that in the future experience effects and general interest rates will be key determinants for the cost-competitiveness of these technologies Producers have been guaranteed a fixed feed-in tariff for years guaranteeing a fixed income Energy co-operatives have been created and efforts were made to decentralize control and profits The large energy companies have a disproportionately small share of the renewables market Nuclear power stations were closed and the existing nine stations will close earlier than necessary in The reduction of reliance on nuclear stations has had the consequence of increased reliance on fossil fuels One factor that has inhibited efficient employment of new renewable energy has been the lack of an accompanying investment in power infrastructure to bring the power to market It is believed km of power lines must be built or upgraded Different L nder have varying attitudes to the construction of new power lines Industry has had their rates frozen and so the increased costs of the Energiewende have been passed on to consumers who have had rising electricity bills Germans in had some of the highest electricity costs in Europe Nonetheless for the first time in more than ten years electricity prices for household customers fell at the beginning of Switzerland edit Switzerland electricity generation by source - percentage share Main article Energy in Switzerland Energy strategy Due to the high share of hydroelectricity and nuclear power in electricity production Switzerland s per capita energy-related CO emissions are lower than the European Union average and roughly equal to those of France On May Swiss voters accepted the new Energy Act establishing the energy strategy The aims of the energy strategy are to reduce energy consumption to increase energy efficiency and to promote renewable energies such as water solar wind and geothermal power as well as biomass fuels The Energy Act of forbids the construction of new nuclear power plants in Switzerland United Kingdom edit United Kingdom electricity generation by source - percentage share By law production of greenhouse gas emissions by the United Kingdom will be reduced to net zero by To help in reaching this statutory goal national energy policy is mainly focusing on the country s off-shore wind power and delivering new and advanced nuclear power The increase in national renewable power particularly from biomass together with the of electricity generated by nuclear power in the United Kingdom meant that by low carbon British electricity had overtaken that generated by fossil fuels In order to meet the net zero target energy networks must be strengthened Electricity is only a part of energy in the United Kingdom so natural gas used for industrial and residential heat and petroleum used for transport in the United Kingdom must also be replaced by either electricity or another form of low-carbon energy such as sustainable bioenergy crops or green hydrogen Although the need for the energy transition is not disputed by any major political party in there is debate about how much of the funding to try and escape the COVID- recession should be spent on the transition and how many jobs could be created for example in improving energy efficiency in British housing Some believe that due to post-covid government debt that funding for the transition will be insufficient Brexit may significantly affect the energy transition but this is unclear as of update The government is urging UK business to sponsor the climate change conference in possibly including energy companies but only if they have a credible short-term plan for the energy

    "content": "Renewable heat - Wikipedia Jump to content From Wikipedia the free encyclopedia Application of renewable energy Renewable heat is an application of renewable energy referring to the generation of heat from renewable sources for example feeding radiators with water warmed by focused solar radiation rather than by a fossil fuel boiler Renewable heat technologies include renewable biofuels solar heating geothermal heating heat pumps and heat exchangers Insulation is almost always an important factor in how renewable heating is implemented Many colder countries consume more energy for heating than for supplying electricity For example in the United Kingdom consumed TWh of electric power but had a heat requirement of TWh the majority of which was met using gas The residential sector alone consumed TWh of energy for heating mainly derived from methane Almost half of the final energy consumed in the UK was in the form of heat of which was used by households and in commercial and public buildings Households used heat mainly for space heating The relative competitiveness of renewable electricity and renewable heat depends on a nation s approach to energy and environment policy In some countries renewable heat is hindered by subsidies for fossil fuelled heat In those countries such as Sweden Denmark and Finland where government intervention has been closest to a technology-neutral form of carbon valuation i e carbon and energy taxes renewable heat has played the leading role in a very substantial renewable contribution to final energy consumption In those countries such as Germany Spain the US and the UK where government intervention has been set at different levels for different technologies uses and scales the contributions of renewable heat and renewable electricity technologies have depended on the relative levels of support and have resulted generally in a lower renewable contribution to final energy consumption Leading renewable heat technologies edit Solar heating edit Solar heating is a style of building construction which uses the energy of summer or winter sunshine to provide an economic supply of primary or supplementary heat to a structure The heat can be used for both space heating see solar air heat and water heating see solar hot water Solar heating design is divided into two groups Passive solar heating relies on the design and structure of the house to collect heat Passive solar building design must also consider the storage and distribution of heat which may be accomplished passively or use air ducting to draw heat actively to the foundation of the building for storage One such design was measured lifting the temperature of a house to C F on a partially sunny winter day - C or F and it is claimed that the system provides passively for the bulk of the building s heating The -square-foot m home cost per square foot or m at m similar to the cost of a traditional new home Active solar heating uses pumps to move air or a liquid from the solar collector into the building or storage area Applications such as solar air heating and solar water heating typically capture solar heat in panels which can then be used for applications such as space heating and supplementation of residential water heaters In contrast to photovoltaic panels which are used to generate electricity solar heating panels are less expensive and capture a much higher proportion of the sun s energy Solar heating systems usually require a small supplementary backup heating system either conventional or renewable Geothermal heating edit Hot Springs located in Nevada Geothermal energy is accessed by drilling water or steam wells in a process similar to drilling for oil Geothermal energy is an enormous underused heat and power resource that is clean emits little or no greenhouse gases reliable average system availability of and homegrown making populations less dependent on oil The earth absorbs the sun s energy and stores it as heat in the oceans and underground The ground temperature remains constant at a point of to F to C all year round depending on where you live on earth A geothermal heating system takes advantage of the consistent temperature found below the Earth s surface and uses it to heat and cool buildings The system is made up of a series of pipes installed underground connected to pipes in a building A pump circulates liquid through the circuit In the winter the fluid in the pipe absorbs the heat of the earth and uses it to heat the building In the summer the fluid absorbs heat from the building and disposes of it in the earth Heat pumps edit Heat pumps use work to move heat from one place to another and can be used for both heating and air conditioning Though capital intensive heat pumps are economical to run and can be powered by renewable electricity Two common types of heat pump are air source heat pumps ASHP and ground-source heat pumps GSHP depending on whether heat is transferred from the air or from the ground Air source heat pumps are not effective when the outside air temperature is lower than about - C while ground-source heat pumps are not affected The efficiency of a heat pump is measured by the coefficient of performance CoP For every unit of electricity used to pump the heat an air source heat pump generates to units of heat i e it has a CoP of to whereas a GSHP generates to units of heat Based on current fuel prices for the United Kingdom assuming a CoP of a GSHP is sometimes a cheaper form of space heating than electric oil and solid fuel heating Heat pumps can be linked to an inter seasonal thermal energy storage hot or cold doubling the CoP from to by extracting heat from warmer ground Interseasonal heat transfer edit Main article Seasonal thermal energy storage A heat pump with Interseasonal Heat Transfer combines active solar collection to store surplus summer heat in thermal banks with ground-source heat pumps to extract it for space heating in winter This reduces the Lift needed and doubles the CoP of the heat pump because the pump starts with warmth from the thermal bank in place of cold from the ground CoP and lift edit A heat pump CoP increases as the temperature difference or Lift decreases between heat source and destination The CoP can be maximized at design time by choosing a heating system requiring only a low final water temperature e g underfloor heating and by choosing a heat source with a high average temperature e g the ground Domestic hot water DHW and conventional radiators require high water temperatures

Cycle limit CO pump return fluid C source C Theoretical Carnot cycle limit source C Resistive electrical heating edit Renewable electricity can be generated by hydropower solar wind geothermal and by burning biomass In a few countries where renewable electricity is inexpensive resistance heating is common In countries like Denmark where electricity is expensive it is not permitted to install electric heating as the main heat source Wind turbines have more output at night when there is a small demand for electricity storage heaters consume this lower cost electricity at night and give off heat during the day Wood-pellet heating edit Wood Stove Wood Pellets Wood-pellet heating and other types of wood heating systems have achieved their greatest success in heating premises that are off the gas grid typically being previously heated using heating oil or coal Solid wood fuel requires a large amount of dedicated storage space and the specialized heating systems can be expensive though grant schemes are available in many European countries to offset this capital cost Low fuel costs mean that wood fuelled heating in Europe is frequently able to achieve a payback period of less than to years Because of the large fuel storage requirement wood fuel can be less attractive in urban residential scenarios or for premises connected to the gas grid though rising gas prices and uncertainty of supply mean that wood fuel is becoming more competitive There is also growing concern over the air pollution from wood heating versus oil or gas heat especially the fine particulates Wood-stove heating edit Burning wood fuel in an open fire is both extremely inefficient - and polluting due to low temperature partial combustion In the same way that a drafty building loses heat through loss of warm air through poor sealing an open fire is responsible for large heat losses by drawing very large volumes of warm air out of the building Modern wood stove designs allow for more efficient combustion and then heat extraction In the United States new wood stoves are certified by the U S Environmental Protection Agency EPA and burn cleaner and more efficiently the overall efficiency is - and draw smaller volumes of warm air from the building Cleaner should not however be confused with clean An Australian study of real-life emissions from woodheaters satisfying the current Australian standard found that particle emissions averaged g kg wood burned range to A heater with average wood consumption of tonnes per year therefore emits kg of PM i e particles less than micrometers This can be compared with a passenger car satisfying the current Euro standards introduced September of g km So one new wood heater emits as much PM per year as passenger cars each driving km a year A recent European study identified PM as the most health-hazardous air pollutant causing an estimated premature deaths The next worst pollutant ozone is responsible for premature deaths Because of the problems with pollution the Australian Lung Foundation recommends using alternative means for climate control The American Lung Association strongly recommends using cleaner less toxic sources of heat Converting a wood-burning fireplace or stove to use either natural gas or propane will eliminate exposure to the dangerous toxins wood burning generates including dioxin arsenic and formaldehyde Renewable should not be confused with greenhouse neutral A recent peer-reviewed paper found that even if burning firewood from a sustainable supply methane emissions from a typical Australian wood heater satisfying the current standard cause more global warming than heating the same house with gas However because a large proportion of firewood sold in Australia is not from sustainable supplies Australian households that use wood heating often cause more global warming than heating three similar homes with gas High efficiency stoves should meet the following design criteria Well sealed and precisely calibrated to draw a low yet sufficient volume of air Air-flow restriction is critical a lower inflow of cold air cools the furnace less a higher temperature is thus achieved It also allows greater time for extraction of heat from the exhaust gas and draws less heat from the building The furnace must be well insulated to increase combustion temperature and thus completeness A well insulated furnace radiates little heat Thus heat must be extracted instead from the exhaust gas duct Heat absorption efficiencies are higher when the heat-exchange duct is longer and when the flow of exhaust gas is slower In many designs the heat-exchange duct is built of a very large mass of heat-absorbing brick or stone This design causes the absorbed heat to be emitted over a longer period - typically a day Renewable natural gas edit Renewable natural gas is defined as gas obtained from biomass which is upgraded to a quality similar to natural gas citation needed By upgrading the quality to that of natural gas it becomes possible to distribute the gas to customers via the existing gas grid According to the Energy research Centre of the Netherlands renewable natural gas is cheaper than alternatives where biomass is used in a combined heat and power plant or local combustion plant Energy unit costs are lowered through favourable scale and operating hours and end-user capital costs eliminated through distribution via the existing gas grid Energy efficiency edit Renewable heat goes hand in hand with energy efficiency Indeed renewable heating projects depend heavily for their success on energy efficiency in the case of solar heating to cut reliance on the requirement supplementary heating in the case of wood fuel heating to cut the cost of wood purchased and volume stored and in the case of heat pumps to reduce the size and investment in heat pump heat sink and electricity costs Two main types of improvement can be made to a building s energy efficiency Insulation edit Improvements to insulation can cut energy consumption greatly making a space cheaper to heat and to cool However existing housing can often be difficult or expensive to improve Newer buildings can benefit from many of the techniques of superinsulation Older buildings can benefit from several kinds of improvement Solid wall insulation A building with solid walls can benefit from internal or external insulation External wall insulation involves adding decorative weather-proof insulating panels or other treatment to the outside of the wall Alternatively internal wall insulation can be applied using ready-made insulation plaster board laminates or other methods Thicknesses of internal or external insulation typically range between and mm Cavity wall insulation A building with cavity walls can benefit from insulation pumped into the cavity This form of insulation is very cost effective clarification needed citation needed Programmable thermostats allow heating and cooling of a room to be switched off depending the time day of the week and temperature A bedroom for example does not need to be heated during the day but a living room does not need to be heated during the night Roof insulation Insulated windows and doors Draught proofing Underfloor heating edit Underfloor heating may sometimes be more energy efficient than traditional methods of heating Water circulates within the system at low temperatures C - C making gas boilers wood fired boilers and heat pumps significantly more efficient Rooms with underfloor heating are cooler near the ceiling where heat is not required but warmer underfoot where comfort is most required Traditional radiators are frequently positioned underneath poorly insulated windows heating them unnecessarily Waste-water heat recovery edit Recycling heat It is possible to recover significant amounts of heat from waste hot water via hot water heat recycling Major consumption of hot water is sinks showers baths dishwashers and clothes washers On average of a property s domestic hot water is used for showering Incoming fresh water is typically of a far lower temperature than the waste water from a shower An inexpensive heat exchanger recovers up on average of the heat that would normally be wasted by warming incoming cold fresh water with heat from outgoing waste water Heat recovery ventilation edit Heat recovery ventilation HRV is an energy recovery ventilation system which works between two air sources at different temperatures By recovering the residual heat in the exhaust gas the fresh air introduced into the air conditioning system is preheated See also edit Air source heat pumps Most common type of heat pump Pages displaying short descriptions of redirect

net exporter of electricity Community wind projects are locally owned by farmers investors businesses schools utilities or other public or private entities who utilize wind energy to support and reduce energy costs to the local community The key feature is that local community members have a significant direct financial stake in the project beyond land lease payments and tax revenue Projects may be used for on-site power or to generate wholesale power for sale usually on a commercial-scale greater than kW Community wind farms edit Australia edit Hepburn Wind Farm See also Wind power in Australia The Hepburn Wind Project is a wind farm at Leonards Hill near Daylesford Victoria north-west of Melbourne Victoria It comprises two MW wind turbines which produce enough power for households This is the first Australian community-owned wind farm The initiative has emerged because the community felt that the state and federal governments were not doing enough to address climate change Telecommunication towers will be repowered with small wind turbines under a new project led by a Newcastle startup Ten small wind turbines will be installed at ten remote Australian communication sites as part of a new project to boost the uptake of the technology Canada edit See also WindShare Community wind power is in its infancy in Canada but there are reasons for optimism One such reason is the launch of a new Feed-in Tariff FIT program in the Province of Ontario A number of community wind projects are in development in Ontario but the first project that is likely to obtain a FIT contract and connect to the grid is the Pukwis Community Wind Park Pukwis will be unique in that it is a joint Aboriginal Community wind project that will be majority-owned by the Chippewas of Georgina Island First Nation with a local renewable energy co-operative the Pukwis Energy Co-operative owning the remainder of the project Denmark edit See also Wind power in Denmark and Middelgrunden

wind turbine cooperatives which had installed of all the wind turbines in Denmark a world leader in wind power Wind power has gained very high social acceptance in Denmark with the development of community wind farms playing a major role In Sams won a government competition to become a model renewable energy community An offshore wind farm comprising turbines making a total of altogether including land-based windmills was completed funded by the islanders Now of its electricity comes from wind power and of its heat comes from solar power and biomass energy An Energy Academy has opened

gained very high social acceptance in Germany with the development of community wind farms playing a major role In the German district of North Frisia there are more than wind farms with a capacity of about MW and percent are community-owned North Frisia is seen to be a model location for community wind leading the way for other regions especially in southern Germany India edit See also Renewable energy in India Starting in a village panchayat local self-governing body in Tamil Nadu state has become completely self-sufficient in energy by using renewable sources like wind solar and biogas The Odanthurai village panchayat near Coimbatore city comprises villages and has a population of about By it had set up its own kW windfarm to meet its energy needs The windmill was set up at Malwadi near Udumalpet and generates about lakh units annually The power requirement for Odanthurai stands at about lakh units and the local panchayat body is now selling the surplus power to the state grid This gives the panchayat an annual income of lakh rupees The village cooperative is also using other sources of renewable energy It has solar streetlights in two hamlets and a nine-KW kilowatt biomass gasifier to pump drinking water from the river to the overhead tanks Doing so Odanthurai became the first local body in India to utilize the remunerative enterprises scheme of the state government The Netherlands edit See also Wind power in the Netherlands Sixty-three farmers in De Zuidlob the southern part of the municipality of Zeewolde have entered into a cooperative agreement that aims to develop a wind farm of at least MW The project will include the installation of three phases of wind turbines with capacities of to MW each The aim is to put the wind farm into service in The Netherlands has an active community of wind cooperatives They build and operate wind parks in all regions of the Netherlands This started in the s with the first Lagerweij turbines Back then these turbines could be financed by the members of the cooperatives Today the cooperatives build larger wind parks but not as large as commercial parties do Some still operate self-sufficiently others partner with larger commercial wind park developers Because of the very unproductive state policies for financing wind parks in the Netherlands the cooperatives have developed a new financing model where members of a cooperative do not have to pay taxes for the electricity they generate with their community wind park In this construction the Zelfleveringsmodel the cooperative operates the wind park and a traditional energy company only acts as a service provider for billing and energy balance on the public grid This is the new role for energy companies in the future where production is largely decentralized In a new company launched a new business model for community energy Windcentrale The wind turbine is sold in physical shares to families Every share does not give financial gains but real power kWh per year average A power company part of the model subtracts the generated amount of power from the yearly power bill Owners only have to pay for the power they used in excess of the amount their share generated The Windcentrale started with existing turbines that were sold in about months months later they sold a turbine in a single evening By the end of they were a community of about members with turbines and about MW rated power Every turbine is owned by a separate cooperative with the Windcentrale doing all organizational work in the cooperative In three years they grew to the same size in members than older wind cooperatives with the average age of years Two of these older wind cooperatives DeltaWind and Zeeuwind are run as a business and are building a MW wind farm

community-owned wind farm Westmill Wind Farm Cooperative opened in May in the Oxfordshire village of Watchfield It consists of five megawatt turbines and is described by its promoters as the UK s largest community-owned wind farm It was structured as a cooperative whose shares and loan stock were sold to the local community Other businesses such as Midcounties Co-operative also invested and the Co-operative Bank provided a loan Community Energy Scotland is an independent Scottish charity established in that provides advice and financial support for renewable energy projects developed by community groups in Scotland The stated aim of Community Energy Scotland is to build confidence resilience and wealth at community level in Scotland through sustainable energy development Findhorn Ecovillage has four Vestas wind turbines that can generate up to kW These make the community net exporters of renewable-generated electricity Most of the generation is used on-site with any surplus exported to the National Grid Boyndie Wind Farm Co-operative is part of the Energy All group which promotes community ownership A number of other schemes supported by Highlands and Islands Community Energy Company are in the pipeline Community Renewable Energy CoRE has worked with Berwick Community Development Trust who agreed on the installation of a kW Enercon turbine near the A The Trust now has an income of a year increasing after the turbine was installed in CoRE supported Oakenshaw Community Association setting up a kW wind turbine near Durham The turbine begun operating in and the Association now receives substantial yearly income Unity Wind Ltd is an industrial and provident society that intends to install two MW wind turbines at North Walsham in North Norfolk Its key aim is community wind turbines and run by community investment and for financial benefit to the community United States edit In the National Renewable Energy Laboratory published a report that identified three different types of community wind projects in the United States The first model describes a project owned by a municipal utility such as the Hull Wind Project in Massachusetts The second model is a wind project that is jointly owned by local community members such as the MinWind Projects near Luverne Minnesota The third type is a flip-style ownership This model allows local investors to partner with a corporation in order to take advantage of Production Tax Credit federal incentives Flip projects have been built in Minnesota and Texas Business models edit Community shared ownership edit In a community-based model the developer manager of a wind farm shares ownership of the project with area landowners and other community members While the renewables sector often spearheads shared ownership initiatives communities can proactively invite participation from renewable energy firms This mutually beneficial collaboration can prove advantageous for both sides Property owners whose land was used for the wind farm are generally given a choice between a monthly cash lease and ownership units in the development Cooperative edit A wind turbine cooperative also known as a wind energy cooperative is a jointly owned and democratically controlled enterprise that follows the cooperative model investing in wind turbines or wind farms The cooperative model was developed in Denmark The model has also spread to Germany the Netherlands Australia and United Kingdom with isolated examples elsewhere At a European level REScoop eu advocates for renewable energy cooperatives to have fair access to the market linking individual cooperatives and federations under its umbrella representing around citizens and cooperatives Municipal edit Some places have enacted policies to encourage development of municipally owned and operated wind turbines on town land These projects are publicly owned and tax exempt An example is the Hull Wind One project in Massachusetts Boston Harbor in A kW wind turbine was installed and is still a great example of small scale commercial wind Impacts of community wind energy edit Economic edit Once a wind farm project is established in a community jobs are needed for manufacturing the materials needed to build the project transportation of supplies to the project area and construction of the project as well as building roads leading to the project After the project is complete jobs will be needed to maintain and operate the facility According to a study by the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority wind energy produces more jobs per kilowatt-hour than coal plants and more jobs than natural gas plants Landowners will also collect revenues for hosting turbines on their property Given a typical wind turbine spacing requirements a -acre farm could increase annual farm income by per year with little effect on their normal farming and ranching operations Community wind energy projects increase local property tax revenue because there was very little to be taxed previously due to the sparse population and vast farm land Once the wind turbines are in service they are taxed creating much needed revenue for the local community Social edit The Midwest and the Great Plains regions in the United States are ideal areas for community wind energy projects they are also often prone to drought Fossil fuel plants use large amounts of water for cooling purposes which is detrimental to communities water supply if there is a drought Wind turbines do not use any water since there is no considerable amount of heat produced during energy generation Wind energy adds power to the electric grid which decreases the amount of oil needed to generate a community s electricity Local land owners who produce the wind energy can also control the amount of energy produced which expands the regional energy mix Overall community wind energy reduces the local community s dependence on oil but because of the subsidies involved can greatly increase their costs for electricity citation needed Typically the ideal form of a community wind energy project is created by and for local people Community wind energy in a social scope can be seen as strong or weak based on how farms prioritize social motivations what local benefits they produce and how well they respond to local energy demand The planning process for onshore community wind farms has low success rates Difficulties arise from local government authorities decisions on what counts as a representative community group limiting community projects to more minor scales Developing community wind energy faces barriers such as uncoordinated organizational structures local authority decisions and intricate planning requirements Community-led projects demand substantial efforts and expertise often comparable to commercial developments Intermediaries like NGOs or private professionals help bridge relationships between local communities and big companies Collaboration challenges arise because large companies require majority stakes in projects Perceived inequity in the distribution of costs and benefits of wind energy projects often show up in survey responses to new projects Studies report that rural communities often have concerns they will disproportionately share the burden of energy produced for urban areas Community-owned wind projects often receive substantially more support from local communities than corporate wind projects due to the perceived even distribution of impacts and economic benefits Involving residents as investors or shareholders in these projects has increased acceptance and public support The flexibility of applications for community wind projects may play a role in garnering higher levels of support from residents An example is Kiowa County Memorial Hospital in Greensburg Kansas which installed a second wind turbine It shows the success and satisfaction that can come with community wind initiatives Community wind energy involves diverse activities such as electricity generation heat generation energy efficiency collective purchasing storage transport education and awareness There is a debated focus on understanding factors encouraging community participation A sense of belonging to a place-based community is often noted as necessary for voluntary engagement in community renewable energy projects Participation experiences and outcomes are not universally positive and there are accessibility concerns that community wind energy may favor affluent communities Community wind projects can offer benefits in stabilizing energy prices for local communities Due to the absence of fuel costs and relatively low operating expenses the owners of these projects can accurately predict their energy costs over the project s lifetime The projects can generate energy utilized locally or sold to local utilities through fixed-rate power purchase agreements ensuring long-term stability in energy prices This can be advantageous in regions where high electricity costs result from fuel imports as community wind projects can help stabilize or even reduce energy expenses Community wind projects find applications in many sectors such as schools hospitals businesses farms ranches and community facilities providing a local source of electricity Ownership of community wind projects can extend to rural electric cooperatives municipal utilities or groups of local individuals forming limited liability corporations This ownership model allows local communities to participate actively and benefit from wind power initiatives Environmental edit Main article Environmental impact of wind power Livestock ignore wind turbines and continue to graze as they did before wind turbines were installed Compared to the environmental impact of traditional energy sources the environmental impact of wind power is relatively minor Wind power consumes no fuel and emits no air pollution unlike fossil fuel power sources The energy consumed to manufacture and transport the materials used to build a wind power plant is equal to the new energy produced by the plant within a few months While a wind farm may cover a large area of land many land uses such as agriculture are compatible with only small areas of turbine foundations and infrastructure made unavailable for use There are reports of bird and bat mortality at wind turbines as there are around other artificial structures The scale of the ecological impact may or may not be significant depending on specific circumstances Prevention and mitigation of wildlife fatalities and protection of peat bogs affect the siting and operation of wind turbines There are anecdotal reports of negative effects from noise on people who live very close to wind turbines Peer-reviewed research has generally not supported these statements Policy issues and legislation edit In the renewable energy production tax credit of cents per kilowatt-hour was established In February through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act Congress acted to provide a three-year extension of the PTC through December Wind projects that were up and running in and can choose to receive a investment tax credit instead of the PTC The investment tax credit is also an option for wind projects that are in service before if the final construction is complete before the end of Smaller wind farms kW or less can receive a credit for towards the cost of installment of the system The ITC written into law through the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of is available for equipment installed from October through December The value of the credit is now uncapped through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of In order to ensure wind energy s future in the energy market the renewable electricity standard RES is a policy in which market mechanisms guarantee a growing percentage of electricity produced comes from renewable sources like wind energy The RES exists in states not at a national level An example is the Obama-Biden New Energy for America plan which sets future goals of rapid renewable energy production at by A pressing issue of concern is the lack of a modern interstate transmission grid which delivers carbon free electricity to customers Currently the US Senate and the Natural Resources Committee have reported the bill out of committee on June A combined energy and climate bill is expected to be considered by the full Senate this fall In the US House of Representatives the House Energy and Commerce Committee approved a comprehensive energy and climate bill on May The clean air and climate change policy is goal to switch from fossil fuel energy sources to renewable carbon-free energy sources for electricity production Generating of U S electricity from wind would be the climate equivalent of removing million vehicles from the roadways Currently the US Senate Committee on Environmental and Public Works has control over the legislation and will begin to complete a markup by September The House of Representatives passed the American Clean Energy and Security Act on June comprising a provision to reduce carbon dioxide emissions below levels by and below levels by It also allocates a portion of the allowances given away for free to energy efficiency and renewable energy However the allowances flow through state governments rather than directly to renewable generators Overall federal funding for community wind research and development is insufficient and even more so when compared to other fuels and energy sources In the US Department of Energy DOE received million from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act for wind energy research and development In the Senate passed a bill granting the DOE million for the DOE wind program For the same purpose the House of Representatives allowed the DOE million See also

    "content": "Wind farm - Wikipedia Jump to content From Wikipedia the free encyclopedia Group of wind turbines The San Gorgonio Pass wind farm in California United States The Gansu Wind Farm in China is the largest wind farm in the world with a target capacity of MW by A wind farm also called a wind park or wind power plant is a group of wind turbines in the same location used to produce electricity Wind farms vary in size from a small number of turbines to several hundred wind turbines covering an extensive area Wind farms can be either onshore or offshore Many of the largest operational onshore wind farms are located in China India and the United States For example the largest wind farm in the world Gansu Wind Farm in China had a capacity of over MW by with a goal of MW by As of December the MW Hornsea Wind Farm in the UK is the largest offshore wind farm in the world Individual wind turbine designs continue to increase in power resulting in fewer turbines being needed for the same total output Because they require no fuel wind farms have less impact on the environment than many other forms of power generation and are often referred to as a good source of green energy Wind farms have however been criticised for their visual impact and impact on the landscape Typically they need to be spread over more land than other power stations and need to be built in wild and rural areas which can lead to industrialization of the countryside habitat loss and a drop in tourism Some critics claim that wind farms have adverse health effects but most researchers consider these claims to be pseudoscience see wind turbine syndrome Wind farms can interfere with radar although in most cases according to the US Department of Energy siting and other mitigations have resolved conflicts and allowed wind projects to co-exist effectively with radar Siting considerations edit Location is critical to the overall success of a wind farm Additional conditions contributing to a successful wind farm location include wind conditions access to electric transmission physical access and local electricity prices Wind conditions edit Map of available wind power over the United States Colour codes indicate wind power density class The faster the average wind speed the more electricity the wind turbine will generate so faster winds are generally economically better for wind farm developments The balancing factor is that strong gusts and high turbulence require stronger more expensive turbines otherwise there is a risk of damage The average power in the wind is not proportional to the average wind speed For this reason the ideal wind conditions would be strong but consistent winds with low turbulence coming from a single direction Mountain passes are ideal locations for wind farms under these conditions Mountain passes channel wind blocked by mountains through a tunnel like pass towards areas of lower pressure and flatter land Passes used for wind farms like the San Gorgonio Pass and Altamont Pass are known for their abundant wind resource capacity and capability for large-scale wind farms These types of passes were the first places in the s to have heavily invested large-scale wind farms after approval for wind energy development by the U S Bureau of Land Management From these wind farms developers learned much about turbulence and crowding effects of large-scale wind projects which were previously unresearched in the U S due to the lack of operational wind farms large enough to conduct these types of studies Usually sites are screened on the basis of a wind atlas and validated with on-site wind measurements via long term or permanent meteorological-tower data using anemometers and wind vanes Meteorological wind data alone is usually not sufficient for accurate siting of a large wind power project Collection of site specific data for wind speed and direction is crucial to determining site potential in order to finance the project Local winds are often monitored for a year or more detailed wind maps are constructed along with rigorous grid capability studies conducted before any wind generators are installed The wind blows faster at higher altitudes because of the reduced influence of drag The increase in velocity with altitude is most dramatic near the surface and is affected by topography surface roughness and upwind obstacles such as trees or buildings At altitudes of thousands of feet hundreds of metres above sea level the power in the wind decreases proportional to the decrease in air density Electricity grid considerations edit Part of the Biglow Canyon Wind Farm Oregon United States with a turbine under construction Often in heavily saturated energy markets the first step in site selection for large-scale wind projects before wind resource data collection is finding areas with adequate available transfer capability ATC ATC is the measure of the remaining capacity in a transmission system available for further integration of two interconnected areas without significant upgrades to existing transmission lines and substations Significant equipment upgrades have substantial costs potentially undermining the viability of a project within a location regardless of wind resource availability Once a list of capable areas is constructed the list is refined based on long term wind measurements among other environmental or technical limiting factors such as proximity to load and land procurement Many independent system operators ISOs in the United States such as the California ISO and Midcontinent ISO use interconnection request queues to allow developers to propose a new generation for a specific given area and grid interconnection These request queues have both deposit costs at the time of request and ongoing costs for the studies the ISO will make for up to years after the request was submitted to ascertain the viability of the interconnection due to factors such as ATC Larger corporations who can afford to bid the most queues will most likely have market power as to which sites with the most resource and opportunity are eventually developed After the deadline to request a place in the queue has passed many firms will withdraw their requests after gauging the competition in order to make back some of the deposit for each request that is determined too risky in comparison to other larger firms requests Design edit Turbine spacing edit A major factor in wind-farm design is the spacing between the turbines both laterally and axially with respect to the prevailing winds The closer the turbines are together the more the upwind turbines block wind from their rear neighbors wake effect However spacing turbines far apart increases the costs of roads and power cables and raises the amount of land needed to install a specific capacity of turbines As a result of these factors turbine spacing varies by site Generally speaking manufacturers require a minimum of times the turbine s rotor diameter of clear space between each adjacent turbine s respective spatial envelope Closer spacing is possible depending on the turbine model the conditions at the site and how the site will be operated Airflows slow as they approach an obstacle known as the blockage effect reducing available wind power by for the turbines in front of other turbines Onshore edit

Creek Wind Farm United States Onshore turbine installations in hilly or mountainous regions tend to be on ridges generally three kilometres or more inland from the nearest shoreline This is done to exploit the topographic acceleration as the wind accelerates over a ridge The additional wind speeds gained in this way can increase energy produced because more wind goes through the turbines The exact position of each turbine matters because a difference of metres could potentially double output This careful placement is referred to as micro-siting Offshore edit See also Offshore wind power List of offshore wind farms and Lists of offshore wind farms by country Offshore wind turbines near Copenhagen Denmark Europe is the leader in offshore wind energy with the first offshore wind farm Vindeby being installed in Denmark in As of there were offshore wind farms in waters off Belgium Denmark Finland Germany Ireland the Netherlands Norway Sweden and the United Kingdom with a combined operating capacity of MW More than GW or MW of offshore projects are proposed or under development in Europe The European Wind Energy Association set a target of GW installed by and GW by As of update The Walney Wind Farm in the United Kingdom is the largest offshore wind farm in the world at MW followed by the London Array MW also in the UK Offshore wind turbines are less obtrusive than turbines on land as their apparent size and noise is mitigated by distance Because water has less surface roughness than land especially deeper water the average wind speed is usually considerably higher over open water Capacity factors utilisation rates are considerably higher than for onshore locations The province of Ontario Canada is pursuing several proposed locations in the Great Lakes including the suspended Trillium Power Wind approximately km from shore and over MW in size Other Canadian projects include one on the Pacific west coast In there were no offshore wind farms in the United States but projects were under development in wind-rich areas of the East Coast Great Lakes and Pacific coast and in late the Block Island Wind Farm was commissioned Offshore windfarms including floating windfarms provide a small but growing fraction of total windfarm power generation Such power generation capacity must grow substantially to help meet the IEA s Net Zero by pathway to combat climate change Installation and service maintenance of off-shore wind farms are a challenge for technology and economic operation of a wind farm As of update there are jackup vessels for lifting components but few can lift sizes above MW Service vessels have to be operated nearly availability higher than of time to get sufficient amortisation from the wind turbines citation needed Therefore special fast service vehicles for installation like Wind Turbine Shuttle as well as for maintenance including heave compensation and heave compensated working platforms to allow the service staff to enter the wind

electricity generating capacity and China has identified wind power as a key growth component of the country s economy With its large land mass and long coastline China has exceptional wind resources Researchers from Harvard and Tsinghua University have found that China could meet all of their electricity demands from wind power by Wind farm in Xinjiang China By the end of at least Chinese companies were commercially producing wind turbines and several dozen more were producing components Turbine sizes of MW to MW became common Leading wind power companies in China were Goldwind Dongfang Electric and Sinovel along with most major foreign wind turbine manufacturers China also increased production of small-scale wind turbines to about turbines MW in Through all these developments the Chinese wind industry appeared unaffected by the financial crisis according to industry observers According to the Global Wind Energy Council the development of wind energy in China in terms of scale and rhythm is unparalleled in the world The National People s Congress permanent committee passed a law that requires the Chinese energy companies to purchase all the electricity produced by the renewable energy sector Europe edit Main article Wind power in Europe In the European Union had a total installed wind capacity of MW Germany had the third-largest capacity in the world after China and the United States with an installed capacity of MW at the end of Spain had MW and Italy and France each had between and MW By January the UK installed capacity was MW But energy production can be different from capacity in Spain had the highest European wind power production with TWh compared to Germany s TWh In addition to the London Array an off-shore wind farm in the Thames Estuary in the United Kingdom with a capacity of MW the world s largest off-shore wind farm when built other large wind farms in Europe include F nt nele-Cogealac Wind Farm near Constan a Romania with MW capacity and Whitelee Wind Farm near Glasgow Scotland which has a total capacity of MW A wind farm in a mountainous area in Galicia Spain An important limiting factor of wind power is variable power generated by wind farms In most locations the wind blows only part of the time which means that there has to be back-up capacity of dispatchable generation capacity to cover periods that the wind is not blowing To address this issue it has been proposed to create a supergrid to connect national grids together across western Europe ranging from Denmark across the southern North Sea to England and the Celtic Sea to Ireland and further south to France and Spain especially in Higueruela which was for some time the biggest wind farm in the world The idea is that by the time a low pressure area has moved away from Denmark to the Baltic Sea the next low appears off the coast of Ireland Therefore while it is true that the wind is not blowing everywhere all of the time it will tend to be blowing somewhere In July Seagreen the world s deepest fixed-bottom wind farm became operative Located miles off the Angus coastline in Scotland it has turbines that generate gigawatts GW

metres sq ft Phase II was completed in August and added more wind turbines with the same capacity and brought the total capacity to MW All turbines describes a graceful arc reflecting the shoreline of Bangui Bay Adjacent municipalities of Burgos and Pagudpud followed with and wind turbines with a capacity of MW each for a Total of MW and MW respectively Two other wind farms were built outside of Ilocos Norte the Pililla Wind Farm in Rizal and the Mindoro Wind Farm near Puerto Galera in Oriental Mindoro Sri Lanka edit Sri Lanka has received funding from the Asian Development Bank amounting to million to invest in renewable energies From this funding as well as million from the Sri Lankan Government and million from France s Agence Fran aise de D veloppement Sri Lanka was expected to build two MW wind farms from due to be completed by late in northern Sri Lanka South Africa edit Gouda Wind Facility South Africa Main articles List of power stations in South Africa and List of wind farms in South Africa This article needs to be updated Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information May As of September a number of sizable wind farms have been constructed in South Africa mostly in the Western Cape region These include the MW Sere Wind Farm and the MW Gouda Wind Facility Most future wind farms in South Africa are earmarked for locations along the Eastern Cape coastline Eskom has constructed one small scale prototype windfarm at Klipheuwel in the Western Cape and another demonstrator site is near Darling with phase completed The first commercial wind farm Coega Wind Farm in Port Elisabeth was developed by the Belgian company Electrawinds United States edit San Gorgonio Pass wind farm California Main article List of wind farms in the United States U S wind power installed capacity in September exceeded MW and supplies of the nation s electricity The majority of wind farms in the United States are located in the Central Plains with slow expansion into other regions of the country Growth in channeled some billion into the economy positioning wind power as one of the leading sources of new power generation in the country along with natural gas Wind projects completed in accounted for about of the entire new power-producing capacity added in the U S during the year Northern Iowa wind farm Texas with MW of capacity has the most installed wind power capacity of any U S state followed by Iowa with MW and Oklahoma with MW Iowa is the leading state in terms of wind energy accounting for nearly of total energy production in The Alta Wind Energy Center MW in California is the nation s largest wind farm in terms of capacity Altamont Pass Wind Farm is the largest wind farm in the U S in terms of the number of individual turbines At the end of about people were employed in the U S wind industry and GE Energy was the largest domestic wind turbine manufacturer In US wind power provided enough electricity to power approximately million homes avoiding the emissions of million tons of carbon USSR edit In the USSR plans to use wind energy were made in the early s the use of wind energy for irrigation systems in the Baku region was mentioned in a letter from V I Lenin in April The first wind power station in the USSR was built in in Balaklava After the Axis invasion against the USSR it was destroyed during the occupation of the Crimean Peninsula by Axis invaders In the Ural Electromechanical Plant began mass production of standard wind power stations for collective farms In the period - more than thousand wind turbines were made in the USSR most of them were installed in rural areas on state farms and collective farms In the early s a plan was developed in the USSR to build wind power plants to provide energy to autonomous facilities in the Far North the construction of which was to be carried out by military builders Later an experimental farm with several wind turbines was built on the bank of the river Desna in the Vyshgorod district of the Kiev region Impact on environment and landscape edit This section is an excerpt from Environmental impact of wind power edit Greenhouse gas emissions per energy source Wind energy is one of the sources with the least greenhouse gas emissions Livestock grazing near a wind turbine The environmental impact of electricity generation from wind power is minor when compared to that of fossil fuel power Wind turbines have some of the lowest global warming potential per unit of electricity generated far less greenhouse gas is emitted than for the average unit of electricity so wind power helps limit climate change Wind power consumes no fuel and emits no air pollution unlike fossil fuel power sources The energy consumed to manufacture and transport the materials used to build a wind power plant is equal to the new energy produced by the plant within a few months Onshore on-land wind farms can have a significant visual impact and impact on the landscape Due to a very low surface power density and spacing requirements wind farms typically need to be spread over more land than other power stations Their network of turbines access roads transmission lines and substations can result in energy sprawl although land between the turbines and roads can still be used for agriculture Conflicts arise especially in scenic and culturally-important landscapes Siting restrictions such as setbacks may be implemented to limit the impact The land between the turbines and access roads can still be used for farming and grazing They can lead to industrialization of the countryside Some wind farms are opposed for potentially spoiling protected scenic areas archaeological landscapes and heritage sites A report by the Mountaineering Council of Scotland concluded that wind farms harmed tourism in areas known for natural landscapes and panoramic views Habitat loss and fragmentation are the greatest potential impacts on wildlife of onshore wind farms but they are small and can be mitigated if proper monitoring and mitigation strategies are implemented The worldwide ecological impact is minimal Thousands of birds and bats including rare species have been killed by wind turbine blades as around other manmade structures though wind turbines are responsible for far fewer bird deaths than fossil-fuel infrastructure This can be mitigated with proper wildlife monitoring Many wind turbine blades are made of fiberglass and some only had a lifetime of to years Previously there was no market for recycling these old blades and they were commonly disposed of in landfills Because blades are hollow they take up a large volume compared to their mass Since some landfill operators have begun requiring blades to be crushed before being landfilled Blades manufactured in the s are more likely to be designed to be completely recyclable Wind turbines also generate noise At a distance of metres ft this may be around dB which is slightly louder than a refrigerator At km mi distance they become inaudible There are anecdotal reports of negative health effects on people who live very close to wind turbines Peer-reviewed research has generally not supported these claims Pile-driving to construct non-floating wind farms is noisy underwater but in operation offshore wind is much quieter than ships Health impact edit See also Health effects from noise There have been multiple scientific peer-reviewed studies into wind farm noise which have concluded that infrasound from wind farms is not a hazard to human health and there is no verifiable evidence for Wind Turbine Syndrome causing vibroacoustic disease although some suggest further research might still be useful In a report about Rural Wind Farms a Standing Committee of the Parliament of New South Wales Australia recommended a minimum setback of two kilometres between wind turbines and neighboring houses which can be waived by the affected neighbor as a precautionary approach A paper suggests that the Wind Turbine Syndrome is mainly caused by the nocebo effect and other psychological mechanisms Australian science magazine Cosmos states that although the symptoms are real for those who suffer from the condition doctors need to first eliminate known causes such as pre-existing cancers or thyroid disease before reaching definitive conclusions with the caveat that new technologies often bring new previously unknown health risks Effect on power grid edit See also Wind power Electricity generation Utility-scale wind farms must have access to transmission lines to transport energy The wind farm developer may be obliged to install extra equipment or control systems in the wind farm to meet the technical standards set by the operator of a transmission line The intermittent nature of wind power can pose complications for maintaining a stable power grid when wind farms provide a large percentage of electricity in any one region However wind farms are more resistant to military attack than thermal power plants as many missiles are needed to destroy them not just one Ground radar interference edit Wind farm interference in yellow circle on radar map Wind farms can interfere with ground radar systems used for military weather and air traffic control The large rapidly moving blades of the turbines can return signals to the radar that can be mistaken as an aircraft or weather pattern Actual aircraft and weather patterns around wind farms can be accurately detected as there is no fundamental physical constraint preventing that but aging radar infrastructure is significantly challenged with the task The US military is using wind turbines on some bases including Barstow near the radar test facility Effects edit The level of interference is a function of the signal processors used within the radar the speed of the aircraft and the relative orientation of wind turbines aircraft with respect to the radar An aircraft flying above the wind farm s turning blades could become impossible to detect because the blade tips can be moving at nearly aircraft velocity Studies are currently being performed to determine the level of this interference and will be used in future site planning Issues include masking shadowing clutter noise and signal alteration Radar issues have stalled as much as MW of projects in the USA Some very long range radars are not affected by wind farms Mitigation edit Permanent problem solving include a non-initiation window to hide the turbines while still tracking aircraft over the wind farm and a similar method mitigates the false returns England s Newcastle Airport is using a short-term mitigation to blank the turbines on the radar map with a software patch Wind turbine blades using stealth technology are being developed to mitigate radar reflection problems for aviation As well as stealth windfarms the future development of infill radar systems could filter out the turbine interference A mobile radar system the Lockheed Martin TPS- can distinguish between aircraft and wind turbines and more than TPS- radars are in use around the world The United States Federal Aviation Administration advises aircraft without position-reporting technologies such as transponders to avoid flight within nautical mile km mi at all altitudes from wind turbine farms Radio reception interference edit There are also reports of negative effects on radio and television reception in wind farm communities Potential solutions include predictive interference modelling as a component of site selection Impact on agriculture edit A study found that in the immediate vicinity of wind farms the climate is cooler during the day and slightly warmer during the night than the surrounding areas due to the turbulence generated by the blades In another study an analysis carried out on corn and soybean crops in the central areas of the United States noted that the microclimate generated by wind turbines improves crops as it prevents the late spring and early autumn frosts and also reduces the action of pathogenic fungi that grow on the leaves Even at the height of summer heat the lowering of degrees above the crops due to turbulence caused by the blades can make a difference for the cultivation of corn See also edit Renewable energy portal Renewable energy

    "content": "Floating wind turbine - Wikipedia Jump to content From Wikipedia the free encyclopedia Type of wind turbine The world s first full-scale floating wind turbine the MW Hywind being assembled in the m y Fjord near Stavanger Norway in before deployment in the North Sea A floating wind turbine is an offshore wind turbine mounted on a floating structure that allows the turbine to generate electricity in water depths where fixed-foundation turbines are not economically feasible Floating wind farms have the potential to significantly increase the sea area available for offshore wind farms especially in countries with limited shallow waters such as Spain Portugal Japan France and the United States West Coast Locating wind farms further offshore can also reduce visual pollution provide better accommodation for fishing and shipping lanes and reach stronger and more consistent winds Commercial floating wind turbines are mostly at the early phase of development with several single turbine prototypes having been installed since and the first farms since As of October update there are MW of operational floating wind turbines with a future pipeline of GW around the world The Hywind Tampen floating offshore wind farm recognized as the world s largest began operating in August Located approximately kilometers off the coast of Norway it consists of turbines and is expected to supply about of the electricity needs for five nearby oil and gas platforms When it was consented in April the Green Volt offshore wind farm off the north-east coast of Scotland was the world s largest consented floating offshore wind farm at MW from turbines each rated at MW It will mostly supply electricity to decarbonise offshore oil but will also provide power to the National Grid However the nearest oil platform has refused to be connected and doubts have been expressed about relying on renewable energy on oil platforms potentially causing problems with the viability of the project History edit Blue H Technologies - World s first floating wind turbine kW installed in waters metres ft deep in kilometres mi off the coast of Apulia Italy The world s second full-scale floating wind turbine and first to be installed without the use of heavy-lift vessels the MW WindFloat about km offshore of Agu adoura Portugal University of Maine s kW VolturnUS was the first grid-connected offshore wind turbine in the Americas in The concept for large-scale offshore floating wind turbines was introduced by Professor William E Heronemus at the University of Massachusetts Amherst in It was not until the mid s after the commercial wind industry was well established that the topic was taken up again by the mainstream research community A summary of projects and developments is given below Individual Turbines edit In December Blue H Technologies of the Netherlands deployed the world s first floating wind turbine kilometres mi off the coast of Apulia Italy The kW prototype was installed in waters metres ft deep in order to gather test data on wind and sea conditions and was decommissioned at the end of The turbine utilized a tension-leg platform design and a two-bladed turbine needs update A single floating cylindrical spar buoy moored by catenary cables Hywind uses a ballasted catenary layout that adds tonne weights hanging from the midpoint of each anchor cable to provide additional tension In December the first large-capacity MW floating wind turbine named Hywind became operation in the North Sea near Norway The turbine was constructed by Siemens Wind Power and mounted on a floating tower with a m deep draft with a float tower constructed by Technip After assembly in the calmer waters of m y Fjord near Stavanger Norway the m tall tower was towed km offshore into m deep water km southwest of Karm y on June for a two-year test deployment Hywind owned by Statoil cost million kroner around US million to build and deploy The -kilometre mi long submarine power transmission cable was installed in July and system test including rotor blades and initial power transmission was conducted shortly thereafter The installation was expected to generate about gigawatt-hour of electricity annually In it survived meter waves with seemingly no wear By the turbine had produced GWh an overall capacity factor of The turbine survived m s wind speed and m waves and was sold in expecting more years of production and tests At the same site the MW TetraSpar was commissioned in December In September Principle Power backed by EDP Repsol ASM and Portugal ventures installed in Portugal the second grid-connected full-scale prototype WindFloat WF was fitted with a Vestas MW turbine and went on to produce over GWh of electricity over the next years The unit was decommissioned in and was later repurposed In June the University of Maine deployed the kW VolturnUS a foot m tall floating turbine prototype that is th the scale of a -MW foot m rotor diameter design VolturnUS was the first grid-connected offshore wind turbine deployed in the Americas The VolturnUS design utilizes a concrete semi-submersible floating hull and a composite materials tower designed to reduce both capital and Operation Maintenance costs and to allow local manufacturing The technology was the result of collaborative research and development conducted by the University of Maine-led DeepCwind Consortium needs update The first MW Hitachi turbine became operational in November and had a capacity factor and a floating transformer see also List of offshore wind farms in Japan Two larger turbines of and MW have been unsuccessful The first floating turbine in Japan was floated near Fukue Island in after a -year demonstration period near shore needs update In late China started its first floating wind turbine a MW MingYang at the MW fixed-bottom Yangxi Shapa III wind farm PivotBuoy received m EU funding in and installed a kW Vestas downwind turbine in -metre water depth at the Oceanic Platform of the Canary Islands in In the first floating wind platform in Spain became operational after being connected to the grid The MW DemoSATH project is a joint effort by Saitec Offshore Technologies RWE and the Kansai Electric Power Company Turbine Arrays edit Commissioned in October Hywind Scotland was the world s first commercial wind farm to use floating wind turbines The farm has five MW Siemens direct-drive turbines mounted on spar platforms with a total capacity of MW Since this several other wind farms have been installed including WindFloat Atlantic in Kincardine in and Hywind Tampen in Mooring systems edit Catenary taut and tension-leg mooring systems along with typical anchor loads and inclination The mooring system provides the station keeping capability and ensures stability of the substructure and turbine There are three mooring systems for floating offshore wind catenary taut and tension-leg These differ in the magnitude and inclination of the load transferred to the anchor As of the most common type is the catenary which uses free hanging chain mooring lines with the station-keeping force provided by the self-weight of the chain A catenary mooring touches down on the seabed in advance of the seabed meaning the anchor is loaded almost horizontally The radius from the turbine to the anchor is approximately six to eight times the water depth A catenary mooring system is used for the Hywind Tampen MW floating offshore wind farm off the coast of Norway Notably this project also utilizes a novel concept of shared anchoring where multiple mooring lines from adjacent turbines are connected to a single anchor reducing the total number of anchors Taut mooring systems use synthetic rope to provide restoring force through the stiffness of the line typically at an inclination to the seabed of degrees Tension leg platforms use pre-tensioned vertical tethers to secure the turbine in place providing large restoring moments in pitch and roll The IEC design standard requires that a loads analysis be based on site-specific external conditions such as wind wave and currents The IEC - standard applies specifically to floating wind turbines Economics edit Introduction edit The technical feasibility of deepwater floating wind turbines is not questioned as the long-term survivability of floating structures has been successfully demonstrated by the marine and offshore oil industries over many decades However the economics that allowed the deployment of thousands of offshore oil rigs have yet to be demonstrated for floating wind turbine platforms For deepwater wind turbines a floating structure will replace pile-driven monopoles or conventional concrete bases that are commonly used as foundations for shallow water and land-based turbines The floating structure must provide enough buoyancy to support the weight of the turbine and to restrain pitch roll and heave motions within acceptable limits The capital costs for the wind turbine itself will not be significantly higher than current marine-proofed turbine costs in shallow water Therefore the economics of deepwater wind turbines will be determined primarily by the additional costs of the floating structure and power distribution system which are offset by higher offshore winds and close proximity to large load centres e g shorter transmission runs With empirical data obtained from fixed-bottom installations off many countries since the late s representative costs and the economic feasibility of shallow-water offshore wind power are well understood In shallow-water turbines cost US - million per megawatt to install according to the World Energy Council while the practical feasibility and per-unit economics of deep-water floating-turbine offshore wind was yet to be established In a French auction closed below MWh US MWh of electricity for a MW project and the high cost small project size and lack of experience keep project developers and financial institutions from the risk of committing to the technology In the MW Pennavel project won an auction at MWh Cost data from operational windfarms edit Initial deployment of single full-capacity turbines in deep-water locations began only in The world s first commercial floating offshore windfarm Hywind Scotland was commissioned in Its capital cost was million or m MW better source needed which is approximately three times the capital cost of fixed offshore windfarms and ten times the capital cost of gas-fired power stations citation needed Its operating costs at approximately MW were also higher than for fixed offshore windfarms A second UK project the Kincardine Floating Offshore Windfarm has been reported as costing million to build or m MW In costs for the MW Hywind Tampen was calculated at NOK billion Cost reduction strategies edit As of October update feasibility studies supported that floating turbines are becoming both technically and economically viable in the UK and global energy markets The higher up-front costs associated with developing floating wind turbines would be offset by the fact that they would be able to access areas of deep water off the coastline of the UK where winds are stronger and reliable The Offshore Valuation study conducted in the UK has confirmed that using just one third of the UK s wind wave and tidal resource could generate energy equivalent to billion barrels of oil per year the same as North Sea oil and gas production A significant challenge when using this approach is the coordination needed to develop transmission lines A report by Carbon Trust recommends ways to reduce cost Also in researchers at University of Stuttgart estimated cost at MWh In California offshore wind coincides well with evening and winter consumption when grid demand is high and solar power is low One of the few ports large enough to prepare offshore wind equipment could be Humboldt Bay UK floating offshore wind could reach subsidy-free levels by the early s according to a study completed by the Offshore Renewable Energy ORE Catapult s Floating Offshore Wind Centre of Excellence FOW CoE The UK leading technology innovation and research centre for offshore energy ORE Catapult has produced a report on the Tugdock technology Tugdock which could enable floating wind developments at sites without suitable port facilities nearby It could also reduce substructure assembly costs by when compared with conventional methods by reducing requirements for costly heavy lift vessels that are few and far between better source needed Floating windfarm projects edit Offshore windfarms including floating windfarms provide a small but growing fraction of total windfarm power generation Such power generation capacity must grow substantially to help meet the IEA s Net Zero by pathway Operational edit The world s first commercial floating offshore windfarm Hywind Scotland was commissioned in It uses Siemens turbines of MW each has a capacity of MW and is sited miles km off Peterhead The project also incorporates a MWh lithium-ion battery system called Batwind In its first years of operation it averaged a capacity factor of sometimes in meter waves WindFloat Atlantic sited km off the coast of Viana do Castelo Portugal has a capacity of MW and has operated since July It produced GWh in with a technical availability of The MW Kincardine Offshore Wind Farm is the UK s second commercial floating offshore windfarm and completed construction in August and became fully operational in October It is located kilometres off the coast of Aberdeenshire Scotland in water depths ranging from metres to metres Two of the turbines have been towed to port for repairs and returned In August Enova awarded NOK billion to Equinor for the NOK billion MW concrete floating wind farm called Hywind Tampen with the purpose of reducing technology costs and supplying of the annual power to the

available information March In Japan planned to build a pilot floating wind farm with six -megawatt turbines off the Fukushima coast of northeast Japan where the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster created a scarcity of electric power After the evaluation phase is complete in Japan plans to build as many as floating wind turbines off Fukushima by The cost is expected to be in the range of billion Yen over five years to build the first six floating wind turbines In some foreign companies had also planned to bid on the -GW large floating wind farm that Japan hoped to build by In March Japan s Ministry of Economy Trade and Industry approved a bn yen m project to float a -MW Fuji in March and two -MW Mitsubishi hydraulic SeaAngel later about km offshore in metres of water depth The Japanese Wind Power Association claims a potential of GW of floating offshore wind capacity in Japan The four-post principle from Fukushima was certified for feasibility in and consortium was formed to mass produce the floating foundations In NEDO announced two tenders to be launched aiming to support the development of both floating and fixed-bottom offshore wind projects in the country The US State of Maine solicited proposals in September to build a floating wind farm The Request For Proposal was seeking proposals for MW of deep-water offshore wind capacity to supply power for -year long-term contract period in the Gulf of Maine Proposals were due by May In April Statoil received state regulatory approval to build a large four-unit demonstration wind farm off the coast of Maine As of April update the Hywind -tower MW wind farm was being developed by Statoil North America for placement kilometres mi off the east coast of Maine in metres ft -deep water of the Atlantic Ocean Like the first Hywind installation off Norway the turbine foundation would be a spar floater The State of Maine Public Utility Commission voted to approve the construction and fund the US million project by adding approximately cents month to the average retail electricity consumer Power could be flowing into the grid no earlier than As a result of legislation in by the State of Maine Statoil placed the planned Hywind Maine floating wind turbine development project on hold in July The legislation required the Maine Public Utilities Commission to undertake a second round of bidding for the offshore wind sites with a different set of ground rules which subsequently led Statoil to suspend due to increased uncertainty and risk in the project Statoil considered other locations for its initial US demonstration project Some vendors who could bid on the proposed project in Maine expressed concerns in about dealing with the United States regulatory environment Since the proposed site is in federal waters developers would need a permit from the US Minerals Management Service which took more than seven years to approve a yet-to-be-built shallow-water wind project off Cape Cod Cape Wind Uncertainty over regulatory hurdles in the United States is the Achilles heel for Maine s ambitions for deepwater wind In Statoil pulled out of the million project of four -MW turbines floating in m depth of water near Boothbay Harbor Maine citing change in legislation and focused on their five -MW turbines in Scotland instead where the average wind speed is m s and the water depth is m In June Maine s New England Aqua Ventus I floating offshore wind demonstration project designed by the DeepCwind Consortium was selected by the U S Department of Energy to participate in the Offshore Wind Advanced Technology Demonstration program In August the project got approval to use non-US barges In January Crown Estate Scotland the public corporation of the Scottish Government responsible for the management of land and property in Scotland awarded GW in leases for floating wind farms along with GW of fixed-foundation There were applicants and winners By April all lease holders had signed up and are required to pay m to the Scottish government Floating wind power has so far been considered costly but industry commentators described the program ScotWind as a commercial breakthrough In December the US Bureau of Ocean Energy Management awarded leases for GW on acres offshore California to winners who are required to pay m The price of acre is less than East Coast leases due to lower competition and higher build cost As of Europe hosts small floating wind farms with a combined capacity of MW Expansion plans are notable with France tendering a MW project off Brittany and two more in the Mediterranean Large-scale auctions are expected in Spain Portugal Norway and the UK which has already allocated rights for over GW Europe aims for - GW of floating wind capacity by potentially reaching GW with supportive policies Research edit Scale modeling and computer modeling attempt to predict the behavior of large scale wind turbines in order to avoid costly failures and to expand the use of offshore wind power from fixed to floating foundations Topics for research in this field include Computer models edit Overview of integrated dynamic calculations for floating offshore wind turbines Fully coupled aerohydro-servo-elastic response a basic research tool to validate new designs Scale models edit Water tank studies on scale tension-leg platform and Spar Buoy platforms Dynamic response dependency on the mooring configuration full citation needed Improved designs edit Gearbox changes including to hydraulic systems may reduce capital and maintenance costs Alternative floating platform design including for lowering the center of gravity improving stability of mooring and semisubmersible designs Other applications edit As they are suitable for towing floating wind turbine units can be relocated to any location on the sea without much additional cost So they can be used as prototype test units to practically assess the design adequacy and wind power potential of prospective sites When the transmission of generated wind power to nearby land is not economical the power can be used in power to gas applications to produce hydrogen gas ammonia urea reverse osmosis water desalination natural gas LPG alkylate gasoline ship-mounted battery storage etc on floating platforms which can be easily transported to nearby consuming centers Floating wind turbines can be used to provide motive power for achieving artificial upwelling of nutrient-rich deep ocean water to the surface for enhancing fisheries growth in areas with tropical and temperate weather Though deep seawater below meters depth is rich in nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus the phytoplankton growth is poor due to the absence of sunlight The most productive ocean fishing grounds are located in cold water seas at high latitudes where natural upwelling of deep sea water occurs due to inverse thermocline temperatures The electricity generated by the floating wind turbine would be used to drive high flow and low head water pumps to draw cold water from below meters water depth and mixed with warm surface water by eductors before releasing it into the sea Mediterranean Sea Black Sea Caspian Sea Red Sea Persian Gulf deep water lakes reservoirs are suitable for artificial upwelling for enhancing fish catch economically These units can also be mobile-type to utilize the seasonal favourable winds all around the year Prototypes and tests edit Eolink edit Floating Wind Turbine Single Point Mooring Eolink Eolink floating wind turbine is a single point mooring system technology The patented structure of this French company based in Plouzan is a semi-submersible floating hull with a masts pyramidal structure The structure supports the turbine by upwind and downwind masts It gives more clearance for the blades and distributes stress Unlike most of the floating wind turbines the turbine rotates around its single mooring point to face the wind The pivot point ensures the mechanical and electrical link between the turbine and the sea floor Eolink grid connected its first one-tenth scale demonstrator in April Ideol edit Steel floating substructure designed by Ideol for MW NEDO project Japan based on Ideol technology fully coated in dry dock before wind turbine installation Ideol s engineers have developed and patented a ring-shaped floating foundation based on a central opening system Damping Pool used for optimizing foundation wind turbine stability As such the sloshing water contained in this central opening counteracts the swell-induced floater oscillations Foundation-fastened mooring lines are attached to the seabed to hold the assembly in position This floating foundation is compatible with all wind turbines without any modification and has reduced dimensions from to metres per side for a wind turbine between and MW Manufacturable in concrete or steel this floating foundation allows for local construction near project sites Ideol leads the FLOATGEN project a floating wind turbine demonstration project based on Ideol s technology built by Bouygues Travaux Publics and operational off the coast of Le Croisic on the offshore experimentation site of Ecole Centrale de Nantes SEM-REV The construction of this project France s first offshore wind turbine with a capacity of MW was completed in April and the unit installed on site in August For the month of February it had an availability of and a capacity factor of In August Hibiki the second demonstrator with an aerodyn Energiesysteme GmbH MW -bladed wind turbine was installed km east of the port of Kitakyushu by Japanese conglomerate Hitachi Zosen Ideol developed the design for this steel hull that was manufactured in a Japanese dry dock In August the French government selected Eolmed a consortium led by French renewable energy developer Quadran in association with Ideol Bouygues Travaux Publics and Senvion for the development and construction of a MW Mediterranean floating offshore wind farm km off the coastal town of Gruissan Languedoc-Roussillon planned to be commissioned needs update VolturnUS edit The VolturnUS design utilizes a concrete semi-submersible floating hull and a composite materials tower designed to reduce both capital and Operation Maintenance costs and to allow local manufacturing VolturnUS is North America s first floating grid-connected wind turbine It was lowered into the Penobscot River in Maine on May by the University of Maine Advanced Structures and Composites Center and its partners During its deployment it experienced numerous storm events representative of design environmental conditions prescribed by the American Bureau of Shipping ABS Guide for Building and Classing Floating Offshore Wind Turbines The VolturnUS floating concrete hull technology can support wind turbines in water depths of m or more With independent cost estimates from around the U S and the world it has been found to significantly reduce costs compared to existing floating systems The design has also received a complete third-party engineering review In June the UMaine-led New England Aqua Ventus I project won top tier status from the US Department of Energy DOE Advanced Technology Demonstration Program for Offshore Wind This means that the Aqua Ventus project is now automatically eligible for an additional Million in construction funding from the DOE as long as the project continues to meet its milestones WindFloat edit External videos A video describing the WindFloat A diagram of the WindFloat system WindFloat is a floating foundation for offshore wind turbines designed and patented by Principle Power A full-scale prototype was constructed in by Windplus a joint-venture between EDP Repsol Principle Power A Silva Matos Inovcapital and FAI The complete system was assembled and commissioned onshore including the turbine The entire structure was then wet-towed kilometres mi from southern to northern Portugal to its final installed location kilometres mi offshore of Agu adoura Portugal previously the Agu adoura Wave Farm The WindFloat was equipped with a Vestas v -megawatt turbine and installation was completed on October A year later the turbine had produced GWh The cost of this project is around million about US million This single wind turbine can produce energy equivalent for homes It operated until and survived storms without damage Principle Power was planning a -MW WindFloat project in using -MW Siemens turbines in m of water near Coos Bay Oregon to be operational in but the project has since been cancelled The subsea metal structure is reported to improve dynamic stability whilst still maintaining shallow draft by dampening wave and turbine induced motion utilizing a tri-column triangular platform with the wind turbine positioned on one of the three columns The triangular platform is then moored using a conventional catenary mooring consisting of four lines two of which are connected to the column supporting the turbine thus creating an asymmetric mooring As the wind shifts direction and changes the loads on the turbine and foundation a secondary hull-trim system shifts ballast water between each of the three columns This permits the platform to maintain even keel while producing the maximum amount of energy This is in contrast to other floating concepts which have implemented control strategies that de-power the turbine to compensate for changes in turbine thrust-induced overturning moment citation needed This technology could allow wind turbines to be sited in offshore areas that were previously considered inaccessible areas having water depth exceeding m and more powerful wind resources than shallow-water offshore wind farms typically encounter A MW WindFloat project received government permission in December with EU funding the million transmission cable The million project is expected to be funded by and operational by Three structures with MW Vestas turbines were towed to sea in A WindFloat with a MW Vestas turbine installed near Scotland began delivering power in late By January the first of WindFloat s three

floating solar with offshore wind turbines have a lot of potential on the Great Lakes DeepWind edit Ris DTU National Laboratory for Sustainable Energy and international partners started a -year program called DeepWind in October to create and test economical floating Vertical Axis Wind Turbines up to MW The program is supported with million through EUs Seventh Framework Programme Partners include TUDelft Aalborg University SINTEF Equinor and United States National Renewable Energy Laboratory Flowocean edit Flowocean is a Swedish technology company with its own proprietary technology for floating offshore wind power with head office in the city of V ster s Sweden FLOW is a semi-submersible floating offshore wind turbine technology with two wind turbine generators on one floating platform The structure weather vanes passively so that the wind turbines always face the wind Flow technology is a combination of Tension Leg Platform TLP and Semi-Submersible which gives the Flow unit the benefits of both principles and allows the unit to be robust and light Flowocean has developed a patented design for floating offshore wind power plants aiming to make floating offshore wind power cost-effective FLOW can be considered an assembly of three systems the floater the buoy and the mooring system The floater is all structure that is rotating The buoy is of turret type is moored to the sea bed and contains a bearing that allows the floater to rotate freely around it The mooring system is the set of components that anchors the buoy to the sea bed i e mooring lines ropes chains chain stoppers and anchors The FLOW units are highly standardised with all sub-systems well proven Inter-array wind farm cabling and mooring systems are shared between the units GICON edit The GICON-TLP is a floating substructure system based on a tension leg platform TLP developed by GICON GmbH The system is deployable from meters to meters water depth It consists of six major components four buoyancy bodies horizontal pipes for structural base vertical pipes which pass through the water line angled piles for connection with the transition piece Cast nodes are used to connect all components The TLP can be equipped with an offshore wind turbine in range of MW The GICON-TLP is anchored to the seabed via four pre-tensioned mooring ropes with a buoyant gravity-base anchor consisting of concrete No pile driving or drilling for anchoring is necessary All ropes are connected at the corners of the square based system The TLP for a MW wind turbine is currently being developed by the GICON Group and their key partner the Endowed Chair for Wind Energy Technology LWET at the University of Rostock utilizing prefabricated steel-concrete composite components in combination with components of steel A main focus of the TLP design is on the modularity and the possibility of assembly in any dry dock near to the installation site and without the use of construction vessels After offshore location is reached joints of TLP and anchor will be decoupled and the gravity anchor will be lowered down by using ballast water Once the anchor has reached the bottom it is filled with sand One unique feature of the system is the sufficient floating stability during transport as well as during operations In October model tests took place in the model test facility of French cole Centrale de Nantes ECN with model of the GICON -TLP incl wind turbine Based on this test a Technology readiness level of was reached Nautica Windpower edit Nautica Windpower

of the expected production of one or more wind turbines referred to as a wind farm in the near future up to a year Forecast are usually expressed in terms of the available power of the wind farm occasionally in units of energy citation needed indicating the power production potential over a time interval Time scales of forecasts edit Forecasting of the wind power generation may be considered at different time scales depending on the intended application very short-term forecasts from seconds up to minutes are used for the real-time turbine control and electrical grid management as well as for market clearing short-term forecasts from minutes up to hours are used for dispatch planning intelligent load shedding decisions medium-term forecasts from hours up to a day are used for to make decisions for switching the turbine on or off for safety or conditions on the market long-term forecasts from a day up to a week or even a year are used for long term planning to schedule the maintenance or unit commitment optimize the cost of operation Maintenance of offshore wind farms may be particularly costly so optimal planning of maintenance operations is of particular importance For the last two possibilities the temporal resolution of wind power predictions ranges between minutes and a few hours depending on the forecast length Improvements of wind power forecasting has focused on using more data as input to the models involved and on providing uncertainty estimates along with the traditionally provided predictions citation needed Reason for wind power forecasts edit In the electricity grid at any moment balance must be maintained between electricity consumption and generation otherwise disturbances in power quality or supply may occur Wind generation is a direct function of wind speed and in contrast to conventional generation systems is not easily dispatchable so fluctuations of wind generation require power substitution from other sources that might not be available on a short notice it takes hours to fire up a coal plant and hours for a nuclear one The problem gets more complex once the wind power starts providing more than a small percentage of the overall electricity supplied to the grid Better forecasts allow utilities to deploy less spinning reserves usually natural gas-based generators The forecasts are typically requested by utilities on two separate time scales short-term minutes to hours forecast is used to adjust the spinning reserves long-term day to week forecast is used by the utility to plan the energy mix or buy electricity from other providers Typically this information is needed on a day ahead basis e g by AM but markets tend not to operate on weekends and holidays so occasionally longer forecasts are used The challenges utilities face when wind generation is injected into a power system depend on the share of that renewable energy and how well connected the grid is Wind power in Denmark meets almost half of the country s electricity demand while the instantaneous penetration that is the instantaneous wind power production compared to the consumption to be met at a given time is sometimes above Unlike some windy parts of the US which lack sufficient grid capacity this is easily exported The transmission system operator TSO is responsible for managing the electricity balance on the grid at any time electricity production has to match consumption Therefore the use of production means is scheduled in advance in order to respond to load profiles The load corresponds to the total electricity consumption over the area of interest Load profiles are usually given by load forecasts which are of high accuracy For making up the daily schedule TSOs may consider their own power production means if they have any and or they can purchase power generation from Independent Power Producers IPPs and utilities via bilateral contracts or electricity pools In the context of deregulation more and more players appear on the market thus breaking the traditional situation of vertically integrated utilities with quasi local monopolies Two main mechanisms compose electricity markets The first one is the spot market where participants propose quantities of energy for the following day at a given production cost An auction system permits to settle the electricity spot price for the various periods depending on the different bids The second mechanism is the balancing of power generation which is coordinated by the TSO Depending on the energy lacks and surplus e g due to power plant failures or to intermittence in the case of wind power installations the TSO determines the penalties that will be paid by IPPs who missed in their obligations In some cases an intra-day market is also present in order to take corrective actions citation needed In order to illustrate this electricity market mechanism consider the Dutch electricity market Market participants referred to as Program Responsible Parties PRPs submit their price-quantity bids before am for the delivery period covering the following day from midnight to midnight The Program Time Unit PTU on the balancing market is of minutes Balancing of the -minute averaged power is required from all electrical producers and consumers connected to the grid who for this purpose may be organised in sub-sets Since these sub-sets are referred to as Programmes balancing on the -minute scale is referred to as Programme Balance Programme Balance now is maintained by using the production schedules issued the day before delivery and measurement reports distributed the day after delivery When the measured power is not equal to the scheduled power the Programme Imbalance is the difference between the realised sum of production and consumption and the forecast sum of production and consumption If only production from wind energy is taken into account Programme Imbalance reduces to realised wind production minus forecast wind production The programme imbalance is the wind production forecast error citation needed Programme Imbalance is settled by the System Operator with different tariffs for negative Programme Imbalance and positive Programme Imbalance A positive Programme Imbalance indicates more energy actually produced than forecast by wind energy the realised wind production is bigger than the forecast wind production And vice versa in the case of a negative Programme Imbalance by wind energy citation needed Note that the costs for positive and negative imbalances may be asymmetric depending on the balancing market mechanism In general wind power producers are penalized by such market system since a great part of their production may be subject to penalties citation needed In parallel to be used for market participation wind power forecasts may be used for the optimal combined operation of wind and conventional generation wind and hydro-power generation or wind in combination with some energy storage devices They also serve as a basis for quantifying the reserve needs for compensating the eventual lacks of wind production citation needed General methodology edit Several techniques of varying degrees of sophistication are used for short-term prediction of wind generation persistence method is na ve it assumes that the wind power in the next time interval will stay the same as the current measured instantaneous power Forecast efficiency naturally quickly deteriorates with time going forward and typically this method is used as a base-level set of numbers for the predictions of other methods to be compared against physical methods that use the numerical weather prediction results recalculate them into the wind speed at the generation site utilizing the physical characteristics of the area around the wind farm and convert the speed to power predictions using the turbine power curve statistical methods are based on models that assume linear or nonlinear relationship between the numerical weather prediction results and the wind power with the coefficients trained using the historical data Two broad subclasses of the statistical models are time series ANNs hybrid methods Advanced approaches for short-term wind power forecasting necessitate predictions of meteorological variables as input Then they differ in the way predictions of meteorological variables are converted to predictions of wind power production through the so-called power curve Such advanced methods are traditionally divided into two groups The first group referred to as physical approach focuses on the description of the wind flow around and inside the wind farm and use the manufacturer s power curve for proposing an estimation of the wind power output In parallel the second group referred to as statistical approach concentrates on capturing the relation between meteorological predictions and possibly historical measurements and power output through statistical models whose parameters have to be estimated from data without making any assumption on the physical phenomena Prediction of meteorological variables edit Wind power generation is directly linked to weather conditions and thus the first aspect of wind power forecasting is the prediction of future values of the necessary weather variables at the level of the wind farm This is done by using numerical weather prediction NWP models Such models are based on equations governing the motions and forces affecting motion of fluids From the knowledge of the actual state of the atmosphere the system of equations allows to estimate what the evolution of state variables e g temperature velocity humidity and pressure will be at a series of grid points The meteorological variables that are needed as input for wind power prediction obviously include wind speed and direction but also possibly temperature pressure and humidity The distance between grid points is called the spatial resolution of the NWPs The mesh typically has spacing that varies between few kilometers and up to kilometers for mesoscale models Regarding the time axis the forecast length of most of the operational models today is between and hours ahead which is in adequacy with the requirements for the wind power application The temporal resolution is usually between and hours NWP models impose their temporal resolution to short-term wind power forecasting methods since they are used as a direct input Predictions of meteorological variables are provided by meteorological institutes Meteorologists employ atmospheric models for weather forecasts on short and medium term periods An atmospheric model is a numerical approximation of the physical description of the state of the atmosphere in the near future and usually is run on a supercomputer Each computation starts with initial conditions originating from recent measurements The output consists of the expected instantaneous value of physical quantities at various vertical levels in a horizontal grid and stepping in time up to several hours after initiation There are several reasons why atmospheric models only approximate reality First of all not all relevant atmospheric processes are included in the model Also the initial conditions may contain errors which in a worse case propagate and the output is only available for discrete points in space horizontal as well as vertical and time Finally the initial conditions age with time they are already old when the computation starts let alone when the output is published Predictions of meteorological variables are issued several times per day commonly between and times per day and are available few hours after the beginning of the forecast period This is because some time is needed for acquiring and analyzing the wealth of measurements used as input to NWP models then run the model and check and distribute the output forecast series This gap is a blind spot in the forecasts from an atmospheric model As an example in the Netherlands KNMI publishes times per day expected values of wind speed wind direction temperature and pressure for the period the between and hours after initialization of the atmospheric model Hirlam with measured data and then the period before forecast delivery is of hours Many different atmospheric models are available ranging from academic research tools to fully operational instruments Besides for the very nature of the model physical processes or numerical schemes there are some clear distinctive differences between them time domain from several hours to days ahead area several km to an area covering half the planet horizontal resolution km to km and temporal resolution hour to several hours One of the atmospheric models is the High Resolution Limited Area Model abbreviated HIRLAM which is frequently used in Europe HIRLAM comes in many versions that is why it is better to speak about a HIRLAM rather than the HIRLAM Each version is maintained by a national institute such as the Dutch KNMI the Danish DMI or Finnish FMI And each institute has several versions under her wing divided into categories such as operational pre-operational semi operational and for research purposes Other atmospheric models are UM in the UK run by Met Office COSMO and ICON in Germany run by DWD ALADIN in France run by M t o-France and GFS in the US run by NCEP Note that ALADIN and COSMO are also used by other countries within Europe while UM has been used by BOM in Australia Physical approach to wind power forecasting edit Meteorological forecasts are given at specific nodes of a grid covering an area Since wind farms are not situated on these nodes it is then needed to extrapolate these forecasts at the desired location and at turbine hub height Physical-based forecasting methods consist of several sub-models which altogether deliver the translation from the wind forecast at a certain grid point and model level to power forecast at the site considered Every sub-model contains the mathematical description of the physical processes relevant to the translation Knowledge of all relevant processes is therefore crucial when developing a purely physical prediction method such as the early versions of the Danish Prediktor The core idea of physical approaches is to refine the NWPs by using physical considerations about the terrain such as the roughness orography and obstacles and by modeling the local wind profile possibly accounting for atmospheric stability The two main alternatives to do so are i to combine the modeling of the wind profile with a logarithmic assumption in most of the cases and the geostrophic drag law for obtaining surface winds ii to use a CFD Computational Fluid Dynamics code that allows one to accurately compute the wind field that the farm will see considering a full description of the terrain When the wind at the level of the wind farm and at hub height is known the second step consists in converting wind speed to power Usually that task is carried out with theoretical power curves provided by the wind turbine manufacturer However since several studies have shown the interest of using empirically derived power curve instead of theoretical ones theoretical power curves are less and less considered When applying a physical methodology the modeling of the function which gives the wind generation from NWPs at given locations around the wind farm is done once for all Then the estimated transfer function is consequently applied to the available weather predictions at a given moment In order to account for systematic forecasting errors that may be due to the NWP model or to their modeling approach physical modelers often integrate Model Output Statistics MOS for post-processing power forecasts Statistical approach to wind power forecasting edit Statistical prediction methods are based on one or several models that establish the relation between historical values of power as well as historical and forecast values of meteorological variables and wind power measurements The physical phenomena are not decomposed and accounted for even if expertise of the problem is crucial for choosing the right meteorological variables and designing suitable models Model parameters are estimated from a set of past available data and they are regularly updated during online operation by accounting for any newly available information i e meteorological forecasts and power measurements Statistical models include linear and non-linear models but also structural and black-box types of models Structural models rely on the analyst s expertise on the phenomenon of interest while black-box models require little subject-matter knowledge and are constructed from data in a fairly mechanical way Concerning wind power forecasting structural models would be those that include a modeling of the diurnal wind speed variations or an explicit function of meteorological variable predictions Black-box models include most of the artificial-intelligence-based models such as Neural-Networks NNs and Support Vector Machines SVMs However some models are in-between the two extremes of being completely black-box or structural This is the case of expert systems which learn from experience from a dataset and for which prior knowledge can be injected We then talk about grey-box modeling Statistical models are usually composed by an autoregressive part for seizing the persistent behavior of the wind and by a meteorological part which consists in the nonlinear transformation of meteorological variable forecasts The autoregressive part permits to significantly enhance forecast accuracy for horizons up to hours ahead i e over a period during which the sole use of meteorological forecast information may not be sufficient for outperforming persistence Today major developments of statistical approaches to wind power prediction concentrate on the use of multiple meteorological forecasts from different meteorological offices as input and forecast combination as well as on the optimal use of spatially distributed measurement data for prediction error correction or alternatively for issuing warnings on potentially large uncertainty Google s DeepMind uses neural network to improve forecasting Uncertainty of wind power forecasts edit External image Tomorrow s prognosis for three system areas Denmark West and East and Estonia Current designs are optimal only for nonturbulent steady conditions Design tools accounting for unsteadiness and turbulence are far less developed Predictions of wind power output are traditionally provided in the form of point forecasts i e a single value for each look-ahead time which corresponds to the expectation or most-likely outcome They have the advantage of being easily understandable because this single value is expected to tell everything about future power generation Today a major part of the research efforts on wind power forecasting still focuses on point prediction only with the aim of assimilating more and more observations in the models or refining the resolution of physical models for better representing wind fields at the very local scale for instance These efforts may lead to a significant decrease of the level of prediction error However even by better understanding and modeling both the meteorological and power conversion processes there will always be an inherent and irreducible uncertainty in every prediction This epistemic uncertainty corresponds to the incomplete knowledge one has of the processes that influence future events Therefore in complement to point forecasts of wind generation for the coming hours or days of major importance is to provide means for assessing online the accuracy of these predictions In practice today uncertainty is expressed in the form of probabilistic forecasts or with risk indices provided along with the traditional point predictions It has been shown that some decisions related to wind power management and trading are more optimal when accounting for prediction uncertainty For the example of the trading application studies have shown that reliable estimation of prediction uncertainty allows wind power producer to significantly increase their income in comparison to the sole use of an advanced point forecasting method Other studies of this type deal with optimal dynamic quantification of reserve requirements optimal operation of combined systems including wind or multi-area multi-stage regulation More and more research efforts are expected on prediction uncertainty and related topics There are a number of questions that have still yet to be answered according to a report from a coalition of researchers from universities industry and government supported by the Atkinson Center for a Sustainable Future at Cornell University They include How do wind farms with their multiple wakes interact with the atmospheric boundary layer to determine the net power that can be produced How do uneven terrain roughness of the land or sea surface and turbulence above the boundary layer and turbine wakes affect unsteady loading of downstream wind turbine blades What is the effect of the atmospheric stability convective neutral or stably stratified on the performance and loading characteristics throughout a typical daily cycle What is the optimal placement of wind turbines in an array so that the kinetic energy capture can be maximized and unsteady loading be minimized The report also provides possible tools used to support this necessary research Accuracy edit The correlation between wind output and prediction can be relatively high with an average uncorrected error of in Germany over a two-year period See also edit Energy forecasting Global Energy Forecasting Competition has a track for wind power forecasting

    "content": "Wind lens - Wikipedia Jump to content From Wikipedia the free encyclopedia Wind turbine type A wind lens in The wind lens is a modification on the wind turbine created by Professor Ohya from the Kyushu University citation needed as an attempt to be more efficient in production of electricity and less invasive to both humans and nature While still in progress the wind lens has a few changes in design which have led to impacts on how wind energy can be used and harnessed while changing how it impacts the world around us A wind lens works like a ducted fan on an aircraft - it encircles the wind turbine and speeds air up while protecting the blades from foreign object damage Because of this wind turbine efficiency can be drastically increased because of a simple installation of a wind lens Design edit As the normal wind turbine does the wind lens harnesses the energy of the wind but has a few modifications in order to increase efficiency as well as decrease the impact on the environment Efficiency of power production edit Studies have shown that the Wind Lens can have between two and five times more output of power compared to the wind turbine due to the way it harnesses more wind The turbulence created as a result of the new configuration creates a low pressure zone behind the turbine causing greater wind to pass through the turbine and this in turn increases blade rotation and energy output One way to get the most out of the wind input is by using a specially shaped tube around the blades The tube or shroud is shaped as a diffuser which works like a magnifying glass for wind The diffuser which is smaller in the front and bigger in the back catches more wind and focuses the wind towards the center blades which also leads to more efficient production of power In addition to the diffuser shape of the shroud the back has a brim This brim disturbs the wind flow which creates vortexes that cause a low pressure area to be formed behind the wind lens The wind then flows to the low pressure area through the blades of the wind lens The increased airflow through the blades leads to another reason of higher power production The diffuser shape and the brim combined creates more efficiently placed and accurate airflow This results in a higher amount of energy that is produced Impacts edit Complaints about the wind turbine include the effect on the bird population sound production and radar interference which limits all its placement in urban areas The creators of the wind lens took a look at the problems and tried to solve them by adjusting the design Bird population edit Wind turbines have a detrimental effect on the bird population due to migration patterns and birds being caught and injured or even killed by the towering high speed blade In order to fix this issue the wind lens shroud that is around the blade helps protect birds from entering the path of the blade and a mesh has been added to either end to prevent birds from being pulled into its blades The addition of this mesh creates a negligible decrease in power production therefore having more benefits In addition to the mesh the wind lens is designed to avoid birds by making it a more compact and shorter therefore making it possible for birds to easily fly over the wind lens unlike the wind turbine Sound production edit Wind lenses have been made such that it produces less sound than wind turbines making it possible for placement in urban areas without disturbing residents The design of the blade is made so the angle and shape of the blade is able to cut through the wind more silently The biggest cause of the sound in the conventional wind turbine is the air drag at the tips of the blades but now the tips of the blades are covered and the more of the wind is more focused towards the center of the blades due to the diffuser shroud which means the air drag at the tips of the blades are minimized Radar interference edit Radar interference is consistently a problem with wind turbines which causes different groups to be against the use of wind farms near urban areas After studies were performed to test the radar interference of wind lenses compared to the wind turbine the wind lens had significantly less interference because of the smaller more compact design of the shroud itself as well as the shape and make of the shroud making it less of a problem with radar interference Limitations edit Despite the beneficial additions to the design there are still limitations The wind lens requires far more materials compared to the current design of wind turbines Such materials for the shroud as well as the mesh requires a great amount of energy and cost While still producing less noise and interference it will still cause disturbances until it becomes zero The wind load on the wind lens is higher and therefore may be too heavy for the wind lens to maintain due to structural challenges This means it may have a lot of power unused or that the wind lens is more prone to breaking The idea is not anything new and previous testing has tried and failed however other projects have never had large scale testing and have come to a stage this far with this much success Application edit The wind lens is being looked to as a way to increase the production of clean energy as well as an archetype for other types of clean energy The wind lens can replace the current production energy of fossil fuels which harms the environment and can be an alternative to the less efficient wind turbine since it is adaptable to more environments and produces higher amounts of energy Current projects edit The wind lens is currently being adjusted and approved by testing it in multiple ways and at multiple places Having been extensively researched at the University of Kettering the wind lens is being extensively tested and has been concluded to be a positive while in use in Michigan In Japan the wind lens is being implemented in urban areas by the shore where windspeeds are high The wind lens is being tested at an offshore site where it was a floating multipurpose body that combines solar panels fish farms and the wind lens to use it for power harvesting fish farming and transportation of resources The wind lens is being adapted to also be used under water as a water lens in order to harvest the power available from water currents The wind lens is being adjusted at the University of Kyushu Ito campus to make it more structurally sound and able to bear the load of the increased amount of wind See

electricity-generating wind turbine was installed by the Austrian Josef Friedl nder at the Vienna International Electrical Exhibition in It was a Halladay windmill for driving a dynamo Friedl nder s m ft diameter Halladay wind motor was supplied by U S Wind Engine Pump Co of Batavia Illinois The kW hp windmill drove a dynamo at ground level that fed electricity into a series of batteries The batteries powered various electrical tools and lamps as well as a threshing machine Friedl nder s windmill and its accessories were prominently installed at the north entrance to the main exhibition hall Rotunde in the Vienna Prater In July Scottish academic James Blyth installed a battery-charging machine to light his holiday home in Marykirk Scotland Some months later American inventor Charles F Brush was able to build the first automatically operated wind turbine after consulting local University professors and his colleagues Jacob S Gibbs and Brinsley Coleberd and successfully getting the blueprints peer-reviewed for electricity production Although Blyth s turbine was considered uneconomical in the United Kingdom electricity generation by wind turbines was more cost effective in countries with widely scattered populations The first automatically operated wind turbine built in Cleveland in by Charles F Brush It was feet m tall weighed tons metric tonnes and powered a kW generator In Denmark by there were about windmills for mechanical loads such as pumps and mills producing an estimated combined peak power of about megawatts MW The largest machines were on -metre ft towers with four-bladed -metre ft diameter rotors By there were wind-driven electric generators operating in the United States from kilowatts kW to kW Around the time of World War I American windmill makers were producing farm windmills each year mostly for water-pumping By the s use of wind turbines in rural areas was declining as the distribution system extended to those areas A forerunner of modern horizontal-axis wind generators was in service at Yalta USSR in This was a kW generator on a -meter ft tower connected to the local kV distribution system It was reported to have an annual capacity factor of percent not much different from current wind machines citation needed In the autumn of the first megawatt-class wind turbine was synchronized to a utility grid in Vermont The Smith Putnam wind turbine only ran for about five years before one of the blades snapped off The unit was not repaired because of a shortage of materials during the war The first utility grid-connected wind turbine to operate in the UK was built by John Brown Company in in the Orkney Islands In the early s however anti-nuclear protests in Denmark spurred artisan mechanics to develop microturbines of kW despite declines in the industry Organizing owners into associations and co-operatives led to the lobbying of the government and utilities and provided incentives for larger turbines throughout the s and later Local activists in Germany nascent turbine manufacturers in Spain and large investors in the United States in the early s then lobbied for policies that stimulated the industry in those countries It has been argued that expanding the use of wind power will lead to increasing geopolitical competition over critical materials for wind turbines such as rare earth elements neodymium praseodymium and dysprosium However this perspective has been critically dismissed for failing to relay how most wind turbines do not use permanent magnets and for underestimating the power of economic incentives for the expanded production of these minerals Wind power density Main article Wind power Wind power density WPD is a quantitative measure of wind energy available at any location It is the mean power available per swept area of a turbine and is calculated for different heights above ground Calculation of wind power density includes the effect of wind velocity and air density Wind turbines are classified by the wind speed they are designed for from class I to class III with A to C referring to the turbulence intensity of the wind Class Avg wind speed m s Turbulence IA IB IC IIA IIB IIC IIIA IIIB IIIC Efficiency German physicist Albert Betz had a crucial role in the development of wind turbine technology Betz s law states that no wind turbine can capture more than of the wind s kinetic energy Conservation of mass requires that the mass of air entering and exiting a turbine must be equal Likewise the conservation of energy requires the energy given to the turbine from incoming wind to be equal to that of the combination of the energy in the outgoing wind and the energy converted to electrical energy Since outgoing wind will still possess some kinetic energy there must be a maximum proportion of the input energy that is available to be converted to electrical energy Accordingly Betz s law gives the maximal achievable extraction of wind power by a wind turbine known as Betz s coefficient as of the rate at which the kinetic energy of the air arrives at the turbine The maximum theoretical power output of a wind machine is thus times the rate at which kinetic energy of the air arrives at the effective disk area of the machine If the effective area of the disk is A and the wind velocity v the maximum theoretical power output P is P v A v A displaystyle P frac frac rho v A frac rho v A where is the air density Wind-to-rotor efficiency including rotor blade friction and drag are among the factors affecting the final price of wind power Further inefficiencies such as gearbox generator and converter losses reduce the power delivered by a wind turbine To protect components from undue wear extracted power is held constant above the rated operating speed as theoretical power increases as the cube of wind speed further reducing theoretical efficiency In commercial utility-connected turbines delivered to of the Betz limit of power extractable from the wind at rated operating speed Efficiency can decrease slightly over time one of the main reasons being dust and insect carcasses on the blades which alter the aerodynamic profile and essentially reduce the lift to drag ratio of the airfoil Analysis of wind turbines older than years in Denmark showed that half of the turbines had no decrease while the other half saw a production decrease of per year In general more stable and constant weather conditions most notably wind speed result in an average of greater efficiency than that of a wind turbine in unstable weather conditions thus allowing up to a increase in wind speed under stable conditions This is due to a faster recovery wake and greater flow entrainment that occur in conditions of higher atmospheric stability However wind turbine wakes have been found to recover faster under unstable atmospheric conditions as opposed to a stable environment Different materials have varying effects on the efficiency of wind turbines In an Ege University experiment three wind turbines each with three blades with a diameter of one meter were constructed with blades made of different materials A glass and glass carbon epoxy glass carbon and glass polyester When tested the results showed that the materials with higher overall masses had a greater friction moment and thus a lower power coefficient The air velocity is the major contributor to the turbine efficiency This is the reason for the importance of choosing the right location The wind velocity will be high near the shore because of the temperature difference between the land and the ocean Another option is to place turbines on mountain ridges The higher the wind turbine will be the higher the wind velocity on average A windbreak can also increase the wind velocity near the turbine Types The three primary types VAWT Savonius HAWT towered VAWT Darrieus as they appear in operation Wind turbines can rotate about either a horizontal or a vertical axis the former being both older and more common They can also include blades or be bladeless Household-size vertical designs produce less power and are less common Horizontal axis Components of a horizontal-axis wind turbine gearbox rotor shaft and brake assembly being lifted into position The rotor of a gearless wind turbine being set This particular turbine was prefabricated in Germany before being shipped to the U S for assembly Offshore horizontal-axis wind turbines HAWTs at Scroby Sands Wind Farm England Onshore horizontal-axis wind turbines in Zhangjiakou Hebei China Large three-bladed horizontal-axis wind turbines HAWT with the blades upwind of the tower i e blades facing the incoming wind produce the overwhelming majority of wind power in the world today These turbines have the main rotor shaft and electrical generator at the top of a tower and must be pointed into the wind Small turbines are pointed by a simple wind vane while large turbines generally use a wind sensor coupled with a yaw system Most have a gearbox which turns the slow rotation of the blades into a quicker rotation that is more suitable to drive an electrical generator Some turbines use a different type of generator suited to slower rotational speed input These do not need a gearbox and are called direct-drive meaning they couple the rotor directly to the generator with no gearbox in between While permanent magnet direct-drive generators can be more costly due to the rare earth materials required these gearless turbines are sometimes preferred over gearbox generators because they eliminate the gear-speed increaser which is susceptible to significant accumulated fatigue torque loading related reliability issues and maintenance costs There is also the pseudo direct drive mechanism which has some advantages over the permanent magnet direct drive mechanism Most horizontal-axis turbines have their rotors upwind of the supporting tower Downwind machines have been built because they don t need an additional mechanism for keeping them in line with the wind In high winds downwind blades can also be designed to bend more than upwind ones which reduces their swept area and thus their wind resistance mitigating risk during gales Despite these advantages upwind designs are preferred because the pulsing change in loading from the wind as each blade passes behind the supporting tower can cause damage to the turbine Turbines used in wind farms for commercial production of electric power are usually three-bladed These have low torque ripple which contributes to good reliability The blades are usually colored white for daytime visibility by aircraft and range in length from to meters to ft The size and height of turbines increase year by year Offshore wind turbines are built up to MW today and have a blade length up to meters ft Designs with to MW were in preparation in and a MW prototype with three -metre ft blades was planned to be constructed as of needs update The average hub height of horizontal-axis wind turbines is meters Vertical axis Vertical-axis wind turbines or VAWTs have the main rotor shaft arranged vertically One advantage of this arrangement is that the turbine does not need to be pointed into the wind to be effective which is an advantage on a site where the wind direction is highly variable It is also an advantage when the turbine is integrated into a building because it is inherently less steerable Also the generator and gearbox can be placed near the ground using a direct drive from the rotor assembly to the ground-based gearbox improving accessibility for maintenance However these designs produce much less energy averaged over time which is a major drawback Vertical turbine designs have much lower efficiency than standard horizontal designs The key disadvantages include the relatively low rotational speed with the consequential higher torque and hence higher cost of the drive train the inherently lower power coefficient the -degree rotation of the aerofoil within the wind flow during each cycle and hence the highly dynamic loading on the blade the pulsating torque generated by some rotor designs on the drive train and the difficulty of modelling the wind flow accurately and hence the challenges of analysing and designing the rotor prior to fabricating a prototype When a turbine is mounted on a rooftop the building generally redirects wind over the roof and this can double the wind speed at the turbine If the height of a rooftop-mounted turbine tower is about half of the building height it is near the optimum for maximum wind energy and minimum wind turbulence While wind speeds within the built environment are generally much lower than at exposed rural sites noise may be a concern and an existing structure may not adequately resist the additional stress Subtypes of the vertical-axis design include Darrieus wind turbine Main article Darrieus wind turbine Eggbeater turbines or Darrieus turbines were named after the French inventor Georges Darrieus They have good efficiency but produce large torque ripple and cyclical stress on the tower which contributes to poor reliability They also generally require some external power source or an additional Savonius rotor to start turning because the starting torque is very low The torque ripple is reduced by using three or more blades which results in greater solidity of the rotor Solidity is measured by the blade area divided by the rotor area Giromill A subtype of Darrieus turbine with straight as opposed to curved blades The cycloturbine variety has variable pitch to reduce the torque pulsation and is self-starting The advantages of variable pitch are high starting torque a wide relatively flat torque curve a higher coefficient of performance more efficient operation in turbulent winds and a lower blade speed ratio which lowers blade bending stresses Straight V or curved blades may be used Savonius wind turbine Main article Savonius wind turbine A vertical-axis twisted-Savonius-type turbine These are drag-type devices with two or more scoops that are used in anemometers Flettner vents commonly seen on bus and van roofs and in some high-reliability low-efficiency power turbines They are always self-starting if there are at least three scoops Twisted Savonius is a modified savonius with long helical scoops to provide smooth torque This is often used as a rooftop wind turbine and has even been adapted for ships Airborne wind turbine Main article Airborne wind turbine Airborne wind turbines consist of wings or a small aircraft tethered to the ground They are useful for reaching faster winds above which traditional turbines can operate There are prototypes in operation in east Africa Floating wind turbine Main article Floating wind turbine These are offshore wind turbines that are supported by a floating platform By having them float they are able to be installed in deeper water allowing more of them This also allows them to be further out of sight from land and therefore less public concern about the visual appeal Unconventional types Main article Unconventional wind turbines Counter-rotating wind turbine Vertical-axis wind turbine offshore Light pole wind turbine Design and construction Main article Wind turbine design Components of a horizontal-axis wind turbine Inside view of a wind turbine tower showing the tendon cables Wind turbine design is a careful balance of cost energy output and fatigue life Components Wind turbines convert wind energy to electrical energy for distribution Conventional horizontal-axis turbines can be divided into three components The rotor which is approximately of the wind turbine cost includes the blades for converting wind energy to low-speed rotational energy The generator which is approximately of the wind turbine cost includes the electrical generator the control electronics and most likely a gearbox e g planetary gear box adjustable-speed drive or continuously variable transmission component for converting the low-speed incoming rotation to high-speed rotation suitable for generating electricity The surrounding structure which is approximately of the wind turbine cost includes the tower and rotor yaw mechanism Nacelle of a wind turbine A MW wind turbine of a type frequently seen in the United States has a tower meters ft high The rotor assembly blades and hub measures about meters ft in diameter The nacelle which contains the generator is meters ft and weighs around tons Turbine monitoring and diagnostics See also Wind turbine prognostics Due to data transmission problems structural health monitoring of wind turbines is usually performed using several accelerometers and strain gages attached to the nacelle to monitor the gearbox and equipment Currently digital image correlation and stereophotogrammetry are used to measure dynamics of wind turbine blades These methods usually measure displacement and strain to identify location of defects Dynamic characteristics of non-rotating wind turbines have been measured using digital image correlation and photogrammetry Three dimensional point tracking has also been used to measure rotating dynamics of wind turbines Technology Development in size and power of wind turbines Generally efficiency increases along with turbine blade lengths The blades must be stiff strong durable light and resistant to fatigue Materials with these properties include composites such as polyester and epoxy while glass fiber and carbon fiber have been used for the reinforcing Construction may involve manual layup or injection molding Retrofitting existing turbines with larger blades reduces the task and risks of redesign As of the longest blade was m ft producing MW Blades usually last around years the typical lifespan of a wind turbine Blade materials Materials commonly used in wind turbine blades are described below Glass and carbon fibers A turbine blade convoy passing through Edenfield England The stiffness of composites is determined by the stiffness of fibers and their volume content Typically E-glass fibers are used as main reinforcement in the composites Typically the glass epoxy composites for wind turbine blades contain up to glass by weight This increases the stiffness tensile and compression strength A promising composite material is glass fiber with modified compositions like S-glass R-glass etc Other glass fibers developed by Owens Corning are ECRGLAS Advantex and WindStrand Carbon fiber has more tensile strength higher stiffness and lower density than glass fiber An ideal candidate for these properties is the spar cap a structural element of a blade that experiences high tensile loading A -metre ft glass fiber blade could weigh up to tonnes lb while using carbon fiber in the spar saves to weight about tonnes lb Hybrid reinforcements Instead of making wind turbine blade reinforcements from pure glass or pure carbon hybrid designs trade weight for cost For example for an -metre ft blade a full replacement by carbon fiber would save of weight but increase costs by while a replacement would save of weight and increase costs by Hybrid reinforcement materials include E-glass carbon E-glass aramid The current longest blade by LM Wind Power is made of carbon glass hybrid composites More research is needed about the optimal composition of materials Nano-engineered polymers and composites Additions of small amount weight of nanoreinforcement carbon nanotubes or nanoclay in the polymer matrix of composites fiber sizing or inter-laminar layers can improve fatigue resistance shear or compressive strength and fracture toughness of the composites by to Research has also shown that incorporating small amounts of carbon nanotubes CNT can increase the lifetime up to Costs As of update the capital cost of a wind turbine was around million per megawatt of nameplate capacity though this figure varies by location for example such numbers ranged from a half million in South America to million in Asia For the wind turbine blades while the material cost is much higher for hybrid glass carbon fiber blades than all-glass fiber blades labor costs can be lower Using carbon fiber allows simpler designs that use less raw material The chief manufacturing process in blade fabrication is the layering of plies Thinner blades allow reducing the number of layers and thus the labor and in some cases equate to the cost of labor for glass fiber blades Offshore has significantly higher installation costs Non-blade materials Wind turbine parts other than the rotor blades including the rotor hub gearbox frame and tower are largely made of steel Smaller turbines as well as megawatt-scale Enercon turbines have begun using aluminum alloys for these components to make turbines lighter and more efficient This trend may grow if fatigue and strength properties can be improved Pre-stressed concrete has been increasingly used for the material of the tower but still requires much reinforcing steel to meet the strength requirement of the turbine Additionally step-up gearboxes are being increasingly replaced with variable speed generators which requires magnetic materials Modern turbines use a couple of tons of copper for generators and cables and such As of update global production of wind turbines use tonnes million pounds of copper per year Material supply Nordex wind turbine manufacturing plant in Jonesboro Arkansas United States A study of the material consumption trends and requirements for wind energy in Europe found that bigger turbines have a higher consumption of precious metals but lower material input per kW generated The material consumption and stock at that time was compared to input materials for various onshore system sizes In all EU countries the estimates for doubled the values consumed in These countries would need to expand their resources to meet the estimated demand for For example the EU had of world supply of fluorspar and it would require by Globally the main exporting countries are South Africa Mexico and China This is similar with other critical and valuable materials required for energy systems such as magnesium silver and indium The levels of recycling of these materials are very low and focusing on that could alleviate supply Because most of these valuable materials are also used in other emerging technologies like light emitting diodes LEDs photo voltaics PVs and liquid crystal displays LCDs their demand is expected to grow A study by the United States Geological Survey estimated resources required to fulfill the US commitment to supplying of its electricity from wind power by It did not consider requirements for small turbines or offshore turbines because those were not common in when the study was done Common materials such as cast iron steel and concrete would increase by compared to Between and metric tons of fiber glass would be required per year a increase Rare-earth metal use would not increase much compared to available supply however rare-earth metals that are also used for other technologies such as batteries which are increasing its global demand need to be taken into account Land required would be square kilometers onshore and offshore This would not be a problem in the US due to its vast area and because the same land can be used for farming A greater challenge would be the variability and transmission to areas of high demand Permanent magnets for wind turbine generators contain rare-earth metals such as neodymium Nd praseodymium Pr terbium Tb and dysprosium Dy Systems that use magnetic direct drive turbines require greater amounts of rare-earth metals Therefore an increase in wind turbine manufacture would increase the demand for these resources By the demand for Nd is estimated to increase by to tons and for Dy by to tons These values are a quarter to half of current production However these estimates are very uncertain because technologies are developing rapidly Reliance on rare earth minerals for components has risked expense and price volatility as China has been main producer of rare earth minerals in and was reducing its export quotas However in recent years other producers have increased production and China has increased export quotas leading to higher supply lower cost and greater viability of large-scale use of variable-speed generators Glass fiber is the most common material for reinforcement Its demand has grown due to growth in construction transportation and wind turbines Its global market might reach US billion by compared to US billion in In Asia Pacific produced more than of the market now China is the largest producer The industry receives subsidies from the Chinese government allowing it to export cheaper to the US and Europe However price wars have led to anti-dumping measures such as tariffs on Chinese glass fiber Wind turbines on public display Main article Wind turbines on public display The Nordex N wind turbine and visitor centre of Lamma Winds in Hong Kong China Wind turbines in the Bahrain World Trade Center A few localities have exploited the attention-getting nature of wind turbines by placing them on public display either with visitor centers around their bases or with viewing areas farther away The wind turbines are generally of conventional horizontal-axis three-bladed design and generate power to feed electrical grids but they also serve the unconventional roles of technology demonstration public relations and education The Bahrain World Trade Center is an example of wind turbines displayed prominently for the public It is the first skyscraper to integrate wind turbines into its design Small wind turbines Main article Small wind turbine A small Quietrevolution QR Gorlov-type vertical-axis wind turbine in Bristol England Measuring m in diameter and m high it has a nameplate rating of kW to the grid Small wind turbines may be used for a variety of applications including on- or off-grid residences telecom towers offshore platforms rural schools and clinics remote monitoring and other purposes that require energy where there is no electric grid or where the grid is unstable Small wind turbines may be as small as a fifty-watt generator for boat or caravan use Hybrid solar- and wind-powered units are increasingly being used for traffic signage particularly in rural locations since they avoid the need to lay long cables from the nearest mains connection point The U S Department of Energy s National Renewable Energy Laboratory NREL defines small wind turbines as those smaller than or equal to kilowatts Small units often have direct-drive generators direct current output aeroelastic blades and lifetime bearings and use a vane to point into the wind Wind turbine spacing On most horizontal wind turbine farms a spacing of about times the rotor diameter is often upheld However for large wind farms distances of about rotor diameters should be more economical taking into account typical wind turbine and land costs This conclusion has been reached by research conducted by Charles Meneveau of Johns Hopkins University and Johan Meyers of Leuven University in Belgium based on computer simulations that take into account the detailed interactions among wind turbines wakes as well as with the entire turbulent atmospheric boundary layer Research by John Dabiri of Caltech suggests that vertical wind turbines may be placed much more closely together so long as an alternating pattern of rotation is created allowing blades of neighbouring turbines to move in the same direction as they approach one another Operability Workers inspect wind turbine blades Maintenance Wind turbines need regular maintenance to stay reliable and available In the best case turbines are available to generate energy of the time Ice accretion on turbine blades has been found to greatly reduce the efficiency of wind turbines which is a common challenge in cold climates where in-cloud icing and freezing rain events occur Deicing is mainly performed by internal heating or in some cases by helicopters spraying clean warm water on the blades Modern turbines usually have a small onboard crane for hoisting maintenance tools and minor components However large heavy components like generators gearboxes blades and so on are rarely replaced and a heavy lift external crane is needed in those cases If the turbine has a difficult access road a containerized crane can be lifted up by the internal crane to provide heavier lifting Repowering Main article Repowering Installation of new wind turbines can be controversial An alternative is repowering where existing wind turbines are replaced with bigger more powerful ones sometimes in smaller numbers while keeping or increasing capacity Demolition and recycling Some wind turbines which are out of use are recycled or repowered of turbine materials are easily reused or recycled but the blades made of a composite material are more difficult to process Interest in recycling blades varies in different markets and depends on the waste legislation and local economics A challenge in recycling blades is related to the composite material which is made of fiberglass with carbon fibers in epoxy resin which cannot be remolded to form new composites Wind farm waste is less toxic than other garbage Wind turbine blades represent only a fraction of overall waste in the US according to the wind-industry trade association American Wind Energy Association Several utilities startup companies and researchers are developing methods for reusing or recycling blades Manufacturer Vestas has developed technology that can separate the fibers from the resin allowing for reuse In Germany wind turbine blades are commercially recycled as part of an alternative fuel mix for a cement factory In the United Kingdom a project will trial cutting blades into strips for use as rebar in concrete with the aim of reducing emissions in the construction of High Speed Used wind turbine blades have been recycled by incorporating them as part of the support structures within pedestrian bridges in Poland and Ireland Comparison with other power sources Advantages Wind turbines is one of the lowest-cost sources of renewable energy along with solar panels As technology needed for wind turbines continued to improve the prices decreased as well In addition there is currently no competitive market for wind energy though there may be in the future because wind is a freely available natural resource most of which is untapped The main cost of small wind turbines is the purchase and installation process which averages between and per installation Usually the total amount of energy harvested amounts to more than the cost of the turbines Turbines using a Doubly Fed Induction Generator can black start the grid as well as reducing destabilisation of the grid from the overuse of grid-following inverters due to their lower cost Wind turbines provide a clean energy source use little water emitting no greenhouse gases and no waste products during operation Over tonnes short tons of carbon dioxide per year can be eliminated by using a one-megawatt turbine instead of one megawatt of energy from a fossil fuel Disadvantages Wind turbines can be very large reaching over m ft tall with blades m ft long and people have often complained about their visual impact In the U S cats kill on the order of times as many birds as wind turbines Environmental impact of wind power includes effect on wildlife but can be mitigated if proper strategies are implemented Thousands of birds including rare species have been killed by the blades of wind turbines though wind turbines contribute relatively insignificantly to anthropogenic avian mortality birds killed by humans Wind farms and nuclear power plants are responsible for between and bird deaths per gigawatt-hour GWh of electricity while fossil fuel power stations are responsible for about fatalities per GWh In comparison conventional coal-fired generators contribute significantly more to bird mortality A study on recorded bird populations in the United States from to found the presence of wind turbines had no significant effect on bird population numbers Energy harnessed by wind turbines is variable and is not a dispatchable source of power its availability is based on whether the wind is blowing not whether electricity is needed Turbines can be placed on ridges or bluffs to maximize the access of wind they have but this also limits the locations where they can be placed In this way wind energy is not a particularly reliable source of energy However it can form part of the energy mix which also includes power from other sources Technology is also being developed to store excess energy which can then make up for any deficits in supplies Wind turbines have blinking lights that warn aircraft to avoid collisions Residents living near windfarms especially those in rural areas have complained that the blinking lights are a bothersome form of light pollution A light mitigation approach involves Aircraft Detection Lighting Systems ADLSs by which the lights are turned on only when the ADLS s radar detects

    "content": "Windpump - Wikipedia Jump to content From Wikipedia the free encyclopedia Wind turbine for pumping water A windpump is a wind-driven device which is used for pumping water The windmills at Kinderdijk in the village of Kinderdijk Netherlands is a UNESCO World Heritage Site De Olifant at Burdaard Friesland Windpumps were used to pump water since at least the th century in what is now Afghanistan Iran and Pakistan The use of wind pumps became widespread across the Muslim world and later spread to China and India Windmills were later used extensively in Europe particularly in the Netherlands and the East Anglia area of Great Britain from the late Middle Ages onwards to drain land for agricultural or building purposes Simon Stevin s work in the waterstaet involved improvements to the sluices and spillways to control flooding Windmills were already in use to pump the water out but in Van de Molens On mills he suggested improvements including the idea that the wheels should move slowly and a better system for meshing of the gear teeth These improvements increased the efficiency of the windmills used to pump water out of the polders by three times He received a patent on his innovation in Eight- to ten-bladed windmills were used in the Region of Murcia Spain to raise water for irrigation purposes The drive from the windmill s rotor was led down through the tower and back out through the wall to turn a large wheel known as a noria The noria supported a bucket chain which dangled down into the well The buckets were traditionally made of wood or clay These windmills remained in use until the s and many of the towers are still standing Early immigrants to the New World brought with them the technology of windmills from Europe On US farms particularly on the Great Plains wind pumps were used to pump water from farm wells for cattle In California and some other states the windmill was part of a self-contained domestic water system including a hand-dug well and a redwood water tower supporting a redwood tank and enclosed by redwood siding tankhouse The self-regulating farm wind pump was invented by Daniel Halladay in Eventually steel blades and steel towers replaced wooden construction and at their peak in an estimated units were in use with capacity equivalent to megawatts Very large lighter wind pumps in Australia directly crank the pump with the rotor of the windmill Extra back gearing between small rotors for high wind areas and the pump crank prevents trying to push the pump rods down on the downstroke faster than they can fall by gravity Otherwise pumping too fast leads to the pump rods buckling making the seal of the stuffing box leak and wearing through the wall of the rising main UK or the drop-pipe US so all output is lost The multi-bladed wind pump or wind turbine atop a lattice tower made of wood or steel hence became for many years a fixture of the landscape throughout rural America These mills made by a variety of manufacturers featured many blades so that they would turn slowly with considerable torque in moderate winds and be self-regulating in high winds A tower-top gearbox and crankshaft converted the rotary motion into reciprocating strokes carried downward through a rod to the pump cylinder below Today rising energy costs and improved pumping technology are increasing interest in the use of this once declining technology Worldwide use edit A working wooden windpump on The Fens in Cambridgeshire UK The Netherlands is well known for its windmills Most of these iconic structures situated along the edge of polders are actually windpumps designed to drain the land These are particularly important as much of the country lies below sea level In the UK the term windpump is rarely used and they are better known as drainage windmills Many of these were built in The Broads and The Fens of East Anglia for the draining of land but most of them have since been replaced by diesel or electric powered pumps Many of the original windmills still stand in a derelict state although some have been restored citation needed Windpumps are used extensively in Southern Africa Australia and on farms and ranches in the central plains and Southwest of the United States In South Africa and Namibia thousands of windpumps are still operating These are mostly used to provide water for human use as well as drinking water for large sheep stocks Kenya has also benefited from the African development of windpump technologies At the end of the s the UK NGO Intermediate Technology Development Group provided engineering support to the Kenyan company Bobs Harries Engineering Ltd for the development of the Kijito windpumps Bobs Harries Engineering Ltd is still manufacturing the Kijito windpumps and more than of them are operating in the whole of East Africa citation needed In many parts of the world a rope pump is being used in conjunction with wind turbines This easy-to- construct pump works by pulling a knotted rope through a pipe usually a simple PVC pipe causing the water to be pulled up into the pipe This type of pump has become common in Nicaragua and other places citation needed Construction edit To construct a windpump the bladed rotor needs to be matched to the pump With non-electric windpumps high solidity rotors are best used in conjunction with positive displacement piston pumps because single-acting piston pumps need about three times as much torque to start them as to keep them going Low solidity rotors on the other hand are best used with centrifugal pumps waterladder pumps and chain and washer pumps where the torque needed by the pump for starting is less than that needed for running at design speed Low solidity rotors are best used if they are intended to drive an electricity generator which in turn can drive the pump Multi-bladed windpumps edit Wind powered water pump on Oak Park Farm Shedd Oregon Windpump in far western NSW Multi-bladed wind pumps can be found worldwide and are manufactured in the United States Argentina China New Zealand South Africa and Australia Commonly known in the US and Canada as a weathercock because it behaves much like a traditional weather vane moving with the direction of the wind but also measuring wind speed The Butler brand added improvements to the technology of windpumps in and A ft m diameter wind pump can lift up to US gallons about metric tons of water per hour to an elevation of ft with a to mph wind km h However they take a strong wind to start so they turn over the crank of the piston pump Wind pumps require little maintenance usually only a change of gear box oil annually An estimated wind pumps are still in use in the United States They are particularly attractive for use at remote sites where electric power is not available and maintenance is difficult to provide A common multi-bladed windpump usefully pumps with about of the annual windpower passing through the area it sweeps This lower conversion is due to poor load matching between wind rotors and fixed-stroke piston pumps Fundamental problems of multi-bladed windpumps edit Inefficient rotor edit Derelict water tank with windmill in the background The main design feature of a multi-bladed rotor is high starting torque which is necessary for cranking a piston pump operation Once started a multi-bladed rotor runs at too high a tipspeed ratio at less than its best efficiency of On the other hand modern wind rotors can operate at an aerodynamic efficiency of more than at higher tipspeed ratio for a smaller swirl added and wasted to the wind But they would need a highly variable stroke mechanism rather than just a crank to piston pump citation needed Poor load matching edit A multi-bladed windmill is a mechanical device with a piston pump Because a piston pump has a fixed stroke the energy demand of this type of pump is proportional to pump speed only On the other hand the energy supply of a wind rotor is proportional to the cube of wind speed Because of that a wind rotor runs at over speed more speed than needed yielding a loss of aerodynamic efficiency A variable stroke would match the rotor speed according to wind speed functioning like a variable-speed generator The flow rate of variable stroke windpump can be increased two times compared to fixed stroke windpumps at the same wind speed Cyclic torque variation edit A piston pump has a very light suction phase but the upstroke is heavy and puts a big backtorque on a starting rotor when the crank is horizontal and ascending A counterweight on the crank up in the tower and yawing with the wind direction can at least spread the torque to the crank descent citation needed Development of improved windpumps edit Windmill patent drawing from vintage aged Aldrich windmill patent drawing from Although multi-bladed windpumps are based on proven technology and are widely used they have the fundamental problems mentioned above and need a practical variable stroke mechanism citation needed USDA experiments at Texas edit Between and a variable stroke windpump was tested at the USDA-Agriculture Research Center-Texas based on two patented designs Don E Avery Patent and Elmo G Harris Patent Control systems of the variable stroke wind pumps were mechanical and hydraulic however those experiments did not attract the attention of any windpump manufacturer After experiments with this variable stroke windpump research focused on wind-electric water pumping systems no commercial variable stroke windpump exists yet citation needed Fluttering windpumps edit Fluttering windpumps have been developed in Canada with a pump stroke varying strongly with amplitude to absorb all the variable power in the wind and to stop the uniblade from swinging too far beyond horizontal from its vertical mean position They are much lighter and use less material than multiblade windpumps and can pump effectively in lighter wind regimes Variable stroke windpump edit A Turkish engineer re-designed the variable stroke windpump technology by using modern electronic control equipment Research began in with governmental R D support The first commercial new generation variable stroke wind pumps have been designed after ten years of R D The kW variable stroke windpump design includes a Darrieus-type modern wind rotor counterbalance and regenerative brake technology Vertical axis wind pump VAWP edit Using a vertical axis wind turbine the redirection of the turbine torque from horizontal to the vertical axis can be solved thus creating a basic shaft connection between the turbine and the pump The direct connection can produce a more efficient wind-pump for example Combining the VAWP system with a high-pressure HP-VAWP drip irrigation system can lead with proper optimization to two to three times higher efficiency than traditional windpumps Combinations edit Tjasker edit Main article tjasker The tjasker In the Netherlands the tjasker is a drainage mill with common sails connected to an Archimedean screw This is used for pumping water in areas where only a small lift is required The windshaft sits on a tripod which allows it to pivot The Archimedean screw lifts water into a collecting ring where it is drawn off into a ditch at a higher level thus draining the land Thai windpumps edit In Thailand windpumps are traditionally built on Chinese windpump designs These pumps are constructed from wire-braced bamboo poles carrying fabric or bamboo-mat sails a paddle pump or waterladder pump is fixed to a Thai bladed rotor They are mainly used in salt pans where the water lift required is typically less than one meter See also edit Aermotor Windmill

transit Personal rapid transit Category Renewable energy portal v t e Sustainable transport is transportation sustainable in terms of their social and environmental impacts Components for evaluating sustainability include the particular vehicles used the source of energy and the infrastructure used to accommodate the transport streets and roads railways airways waterways and canals Transportation sustainability is largely being measured by transportation system effectiveness and efficiency as well as the environmental and climate impacts of the system Transport systems have significant impacts on the environment In it contributed to around of global CO emissions Greenhouse gas emissions from transport are increasing at a faster rate than any other energy using sector A study published in Journal of Transport Geography found that shared electric bicycle systems reduce urban transport-related carbon emissions by about grams per kilometre particularly in non-central urban areas and when powered by low-carbon electricity sources Road transport is also a major contributor to local air pollution and smog Sustainable transport systems make a positive contribution to the environmental social and economic sustainability of the communities they serve Transport systems exist to provide social and economic connections and people quickly take up the opportunities offered by increased mobility with poor households benefiting greatly from low carbon transport options The advantages of increased mobility need to be weighed against the environmental social and economic costs that transport systems pose Short-term activity often promotes incremental improvement in fuel efficiency and vehicle emissions controls while long-term goals include migrating transportation from fossil-based energy to other alternatives such as renewable energy and use of other renewable resources The entire life cycle of transport systems is subject to sustainability measurement and optimization The United Nations Environment Programme UNEP estimates that each year million premature deaths from outdoor air pollution could be avoided Particularly hazardous for health are emissions of black carbon a component of particulate matter which is a known cause of respiratory and carcinogenic diseases and a significant contributor to global climate change The links between greenhouse gas emissions and particulate matter make low carbon transport an increasingly sustainable investment at local level both by reducing emission levels and thus mitigating climate change and by improving public health through better air quality The term green mobility also refers to clean ways of movement or sustainable transport The social costs of transport include road crashes air pollution physical inactivity time taken away from the family while commuting and vulnerability to fuel price increases Many of these negative impacts fall disproportionately on those social groups who are also least likely to own and drive cars Traffic congestion imposes economic costs by wasting people s time and by slowing the delivery of goods and services Traditional transport planning aims to improve mobility especially for vehicles and may fail to adequately consider wider impacts But the real purpose of transport is access to work education goods and services friends and family and there are proven techniques to improve access while simultaneously reducing environmental and social impacts and managing traffic congestion Communities which are successfully improving the sustainability of their transport networks are doing so as part of a wider program of creating more vibrant livable sustainable cities Definition edit Ekorent s electric car in Helsinki Finland The term sustainable transport came into use as a logical follow-on from sustainable development and is used to describe modes of transport and systems of transport planning which are consistent with wider concerns of sustainability There are many definitions of the sustainable transport and of the related terms sustainable transportation and sustainable mobility One such definition from the European Union Council of Ministers of Transport defines a sustainable transportation system as one that Allows the basic access and development needs of individuals companies and society to be met safely and in a manner consistent with human and ecosystem health and promotes equity within and between successive generations Is affordable operates fairly and efficiently offers a choice of transport mode and supports a competitive economy as well as balanced regional development Limits emissions and waste within the planet s ability to absorb them uses renewable resources at or below their rates of generation and uses non-renewable resources at or below the rates of development of renewable substitutes while minimizing the impact on the use of land and the generation of noise Sustainability extends beyond just the operating efficiency and emissions A life-cycle assessment involves production use and post-use considerations A cradle-to-cradle design is more important than a focus on a single factor such as energy efficiency Benefits edit Sustainable transport has many social and economic benefits that can accelerate local sustainable development According to a series of serious reports by the Low Emission Development Strategies Global Partnership LEDS GP sustainable transport can help create jobs improve commuter safety through investment in bicycle lanes pedestrian pathways and non-pedestrian pathways make access to employment and social opportunities more affordable and efficient It also offers a practical opportunity to save people s time and household income as well as government budgets making investment in sustainable transport a win-win opportunity Environmental impact edit Main articles Green vehicle electric bus and light rail The bus rapid transit of Metz uses a diesel-electric hybrid driving system developed by Belgian Van Hool manufacturer Electric Transmetro in Guatemala City Transport systems are major emitters of greenhouse gases responsible for of world energy-related GHG emissions in with about three-quarters coming from road vehicles Data from stated that one-third of all greenhouse gases produced are due to transportation Currently of transport energy comes from petroleum Energy is consumed in the manufacture as well as the use of vehicles and is embodied in transport infrastructure including roads bridges and railways Motorized transport also releases exhaust fumes that contain particulate matter which is hazardous to human health and a contributor to climate change The first historical attempts of evaluating the Life Cycle environmental impact of vehicle is due to Theodore Von Karman After decades in which all the analysis has been focused on emending the Von Karman model Dewulf and Van Langenhove have introduced a model based on the second law of thermodynamics and exergy analysis Chester and Orwath have developed a similar model based on the first law that accounts the necessary costs for the infrastructure The environmental impacts of transport can be reduced by reducing the weight of vehicles sustainable styles of driving reducing the friction of tires encouraging electric and hybrid vehicles improving the walking and cycling environment in cities and by enhancing the role of public transport especially electric rail Green vehicles are intended to have less environmental impact than equivalent standard vehicles although when the environmental impact of a vehicle is assessed over the whole of its life cycle this may not be the case Electric vehicle technology significantly reduces transport CO emissions when comparing battery electric vehicles BEVs with equivalent internal combustion engine vehicles ICEVs The extent to which it does this depends on the embodied energy of the vehicle and the source of the electricity Lifecycle greenhouse gas emission reductions from BEVs are significant even in countries with relatively high shares of coal in their electricity generation mix such as China and India As a specific example a Nissan Leaf in the UK in produced one third of the greenhouse gases than the average internal combustion car Even in countries where electricity is largely generated from coal such as China and India battery-electric vehicles BEVs have lower lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions The advantages of BEVs will further increase by as countries increasingly adopt clean electricity sources Battery electric vehicles have lower lifecycle emissions than other vehicle types Abbreviations used in this chart - ICE V internal combustion

IEA s Announced Pledges Scenario NZE IEA s Net Zero Emissions by Scenario The Online Electric Vehicle OLEV developed by the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology KAIST is an electric vehicle that can be charged while stationary or driving thus removing the need to stop at a charging station The City of Gumi in South Korea runs a km roundtrip along which the bus will receive kW horsepower electricity at an maximum power transmission efficiency rate while maintaining a cm air gap between the underbody of the vehicle and the road surface At that power only a few sections of the road need embedded cables Hybrid vehicles which use an internal combustion engine combined with an electric engine to achieve better fuel efficiency than a regular combustion engine are already common Natural gas is also used as a transport fuel but is a less promising technology as it is still a fossil fuel and still has significant emissions though lower than gasoline diesel etc Brazil met of its transport fuel needs from bioethanol in but the OECD has warned that the success of first-generation biofuels in Brazil is due to specific local circumstances Internationally first-generation biofuels are forecast to have little or no impact on greenhouse emissions at significantly higher cost than energy efficiency measures The later generation biofuels however nd to th generation do have significant environmental benefit as they are no driving force for deforestation or struggle with the food vs fuel issue In practice there is a sliding scale of green transport depending on the sustainability of the option Green vehicles are more fuel-efficient but only in comparison with standard vehicles and they still contribute to traffic congestion and road crashes Well-patronized public transport networks based on traditional diesel buses use less fuel per passenger than private vehicles and are generally safer and use less road space than private vehicles Green public transport vehicles including electric trains trams and electric buses combine the advantages of green vehicles with those of sustainable transport choices Other transport choices with very low environmental impact are cycling and other human-powered vehicles and animal powered transport The most common green transport choice with the least environmental impact is walking Transport on rails boasts an excellent efficiency see fuel efficiency in transportation Transport and social sustainability edit A tram in Melbourne Australia Cities with overbuilt roadways have experienced unintended consequences linked to radical drops in public transport walking and cycling In many cases streets became void of life Stores schools government centers and libraries moved away from central cities and residents who did not flee to the suburbs experienced a much reduced quality of public space and of public services As schools were closed their mega-school replacements in outlying areas generated additional traffic the number of cars on US roads between and a m increases during the school year Yet another impact was an increase in sedentary lifestyles causing and complicating a national epidemic of obesity and accompanying dramatically increased health care costs Car-based transport systems present barriers to employment in low-income neighborhoods with many low-income individuals and families forced to use cars they cannot afford to maintain their income This is also referred to as forced car ownership These effects are spread unevenly across people and places resulting in a transport divide Potential shift to sustainable transport in developing countries edit In developing countries such as Uganda researchers have sought to determine factors that could possibly influence travelers to opt for bicycles as an alternative to motorcycle taxis boda boda The findings suggest that generally the age gender and ability of the individual to cycle in the first place are key determinants of their willingness to shift to a more sustainable mode Transport system improvements that could reduce the perceived risks of cycling were also seen to be the most impactful changes that could contribute towards the greater use of bicycles Cities edit Futurama an exhibit at the New York World s Fair was sponsored by General Motors and showed a vision of the City of Tomorrow Main article Transit-oriented development Further information Carfree city Cities are shaped by their transport systems In The City in History Lewis Mumford documented how the location and layout of cities was shaped around a walkable center often located near a port or waterway and with suburbs accessible by animal transport or later by rail or tram lines In the New York World s Fair included a model of an imagined city built around a car-based transport system In this greater and better world of tomorrow residential commercial and industrial areas were separated and skyscrapers loomed over a network of urban motorways These ideas captured the popular imagination and are credited with influencing city planning from the s to the s Interstate and Interstate near downtown Houston Texas The emergence of the car in the post-war era led to major changes in the structure and function of cities There was some opposition to these changes at the time The writings of Jane Jacobs in particular The Death and Life of Great American Cities provide a poignant reminder of what was lost in this transformation and a record of community efforts to resist these changes Lewis Mumford asked is the city for cars or for people Donald Appleyard documented the consequences for communities of increasing car traffic in The View from the Road and in the UK Mayer Hillman first published research into the impacts of traffic on child independent mobility in Despite these notes of caution trends in car ownership car use and fuel consumption continued steeply upward throughout the post-war period Mainstream transport planning in Europe has by contrast never been based on assumptions that the private car was the best or only solution for urban mobility For example the Dutch Transport Structure Scheme has since the s required that demand for additional vehicle capacity only be met if the contribution to societal welfare is positive and since has included an explicit target to halve the rate of growth in vehicle traffic Some cities outside Europe have also consistently linked transport to sustainability and to land-use planning notably Curitiba Brazil Portland Oregon and Vancouver Canada Greenhouse gas emissions from transport vary widely even for cities of comparable wealth Source UITP Mobility in Cities Database There are major differences in transport energy consumption between cities an average U S urban dweller uses times more energy annually for private transport than a Chinese urban resident and almost four times as much as a European urban dweller These differences cannot be explained by wealth alone but are closely linked to the rates of walking cycling and public transport use and to enduring features of the city including urban density and urban design A bypass in the Old Town in Szczecin Poland The cities and nations that have invested most heavily in car-based transport systems are now the least environmentally sustainable as measured by per capita fossil fuel use The social and economic sustainability of car-based transportation engineering has also been questioned Within the United States residents of sprawling cities make more frequent and longer car trips while residents of traditional urban neighborhoods make a similar number of trips but travel shorter distances and walk cycle and use transit more often It has been calculated that New York City residents save billion each year simply by owning fewer cars and driving less than the average American A less car intensive means of urban transport is carsharing which is becoming popular in North America and Europe and according to The Economist carsharing can reduce car ownership at an estimated rate of one rental car replacing owned vehicles Car sharing has also begun in the developing world where traffic and urban density is often worse than in developed countries Companies like Zoom in India eHi in China and Carrot in Mexico are bringing car-sharing to developing countries in an effort to reduce car-related pollution ameliorate traffic and expand the number of people who have access to cars A ternary plot displaying the modes of transport in cities The European Commission adopted the Action Plan on urban mobility on September for sustainable urban mobility The European Commission will conduct a review of the implementation of the Action Plan in the year and will assess the need for further action In of the European population lived in urban areas which are key to growth and employment Cities need efficient transport systems to support their economy and the welfare of their inhabitants Around of the EU s GDP is generated in cities Urban areas face today the challenge of making transport sustainable in environmental CO air pollution noise and competitiveness congestion terms while at the same time addressing social concerns These range from the need to respond to health problems and demographic trends fostering economic and social cohesion to taking into account the needs of persons with reduced mobility families and children The C Cities Climate Leadership Group C is a group of cities around the world driving urban action that reduces greenhouse gas emissions and climate risks while increasing the health and wellbeing of urban citizens In October by signing the C Clean Air Cities Declaration mayors recognized that breathing clean air is a human right and committed to work together to form a global coalition for clean air Papers have been written showing with satellite data that cities with subway systems produce much less greenhouse gas Policies and governance edit Seven sustainable transportations in one photo Prague Carbon emissions per passenger By country edit United Kingdom edit In the UK Government released the Climate Change Act which legislated an reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by compared to a baseline of In the Climate Change Act was amended and it now mandates a reduction of emissions by This brings a net zero target In the UK Department for Transport published their transport decarbonisation plan called Decarbonising Transport A better greener Britain This plan outlines how the UK transport sector will decarbonise by The six key strategic priorities therein revolve around modal shift to active and public transport decarbonised road transport freight transport innovation place-based solutions and aviation and shipping In the Institute for Public Policy Research issued a statement saying that car use in the United Kingdom must shrink while active transport and public transport should be used more The Department for Transport responded that they will spend billion pounds on active transport more than ever including making England and the rest of the UK s railways greener UK studies have shown that a modal shift to rail from air could result in a sixtyfold reduction in CO emissions Germany edit Some Western countries are making transportation more sustainable in both long-term and short-term implementations An example is the modification in available transportation in Freiburg Germany The city has implemented extensive methods of public transportation cycling and walking along with large areas where cars are not allowed United States edit Since many Western countries are highly automobile-oriented the main transit that people use is personal vehicles About of their travel involves cars Therefore automobiles are one of the highest greenhouse gases emitters in the United States The federal government has to come up with some plans to reduce the total number of vehicle trips to lower greenhouse gases emission Such as Improve public transport through the provision of larger coverage area in order to provide more mobility and accessibility new technology to provide a more reliable and responsive public transportation network Encourage walking and biking through the provision of wider pedestrian pathway bike share stations in downtowns locate parking lots far from the shopping center limit on street parking slower traffic lane in downtown area Increase the cost of car ownership and gas taxes through increased parking fees and tolls encouraging people to drive more fuel efficient vehicles This can produce a social equity problem since lower income people usually drive older vehicles with lower fuel efficiency Government can use the extra revenue collected from taxes and tolls to improve public transportation and benefit poor communities Other states and nations have built efforts to translate knowledge in behavioral economics into evidence-based sustainable transportation policies France edit In March an advertising regulation will come into force in France requiring all advertising materials for automobiles to include one of three standard disclaimers promoting the use of sustainable transport practices This applies to all vehicles including electric vehicles In it will also become illegal to advertise vehicles which emit more than grams of carbon dioxide per-kilometer At city level edit See also Urban sprawl Sustainable transport policies have their greatest impact at the city level Some of the biggest cities in Western Europe have a relatively sustainable transport In Paris of trips are made by walking by bicycle by public transport and only by car In the entire Ile-de-France region walking is the most popular way of transportation In Amsterdam of trips are made by walking by bicycle by public transport and only by car In Copenhagen of people commute to school or work by bicycle Outside Western Europe cities which have consistently included sustainability as a key consideration in transport and land use planning include Curitiba Brazil Bogota Colombia Portland Oregon and Vancouver Canada The state of Victoria Australia passed legislation in the Transport Integration Act to compel its transport agencies to actively consider sustainability issues including climate change impacts in transport policy planning and operations Many other cities throughout the world have recognized the need to link sustainability and transport policies for example by joining the Cities for Climate Protection program Some cities are trying to become car-free cities e g limit or exclude the usage of cars Oil price trend both nominal and adjusted to inflation Vehicle-miles traveled in the United States up to March In the COVID- pandemic pushed several cities to adopt a plan to drastically increase biking and walking these included Milan London Brighton and Dublin These plans were taken to facilitate social distancing by avoiding public transport and at the same time prevent a rise in traffic congestion and air pollution from increase in car use A similar plan was adopted by New York City and Paris The pandemic s impact on urban public transportation means revenue declines will put a strain on operators finances and may cause creditworthiness to worsen Governments might be forced to subsidize operators with financial transfers in turn reducing resources available for investment in greener transportation systems Community and grassroots action edit Sustainable transport is fundamentally a grassroots movement albeit one which is now recognized as of citywide national and international significance Whereas it started as a movement driven by environmental concerns over these last years there has been increased emphasis on social equity and fairness issues and in particular the need to ensure proper access and services for lower income groups and people with mobility limitations including the fast-growing population of older citizens Many of the people exposed to the most vehicle noise pollution and safety risk have been those who do not own or cannot drive cars and those for whom the cost of car ownership causes a severe financial burden An organization called Greenxc started in created a national awareness campaign in the United States encouraging people to carpool by ride-sharing cross country stopping over at various destinations along the way and documenting their travel through video footage posts and photography Ride-sharing reduces individual s carbon footprint by allowing several people to use one car instead of everyone using individual cars At the beginning of the st century some companies are trying to increase the use of sailing ships even for commercial purposes for example Fairtrannsport and New Dawn Traders They have created the Sail Cargo Alliance The European Investment Bank committed million between and to green marine transport funding the building of new ships and the retrofitting of current ships with eco-friendly technologies to increase their energy efficiency and lower harmful emissions The bank also offered an average of billion per year from to for sustainable transportation solutions and climate-friendly initiatives In railway projects received around of overall transport loans while urban mobility received approximately Recent trends edit The global stock of both plug-in hybrid electric vehicles PHEVs and battery electric vehicles BEVs has grown steadily since the s Sales of electric vehicles EVs indicate a trend away from gas-powered vehicles Overall GHG from transport Car travel increased steadily throughout the twentieth century but trends since have been more complex Oil price rises from have been linked to a decline in per capita fuel use for private vehicle travel in the US Britain and Australia In global oil consumption fell by overall with significant declines in consumption in North America Western Europe and parts of Asia Other factors affecting a decline in driving at least in America include the retirement of Baby Boomers who now drive less preference for other travel modes such as transit by younger age cohorts the Great Recession and the rising use of technology internet mobile devices which have made travel less necessary and possibly less attractive Greenwashing edit The term green transport is often used as a greenwash marketing technique for products which are not proven to make a positive contribution to environmental sustainability Such claims can be legally challenged For instance the Norwegian Consumer Ombudsman has targeted car manufacturers who claim that their cars are green clean or environmentally friendly Manufacturers risk fines if they fail to drop the words The Australian Competition Consumer Commission ACCC describes green claims on products as very vague inviting consumers to give a wide range of meanings to the claim which risks misleading them In the ACCC forced a car retailer to stop its green marketing of Saab cars which was found by the Australian Federal Court to be misleading Innovation edit A wide range of technologies are being explored and developed and shape the transportation sector in direction of sustainability and digitization Innovation dynamics based on patent growth rate in the transportation sector between and According to the International Energy Agency IEA the transportation sector accounts for more than one-third of CO emissions globally This megatrend drives the development of technologies and practices that reduce the environmental impact of transportation such as the development and eventually the adoption of innovative solutions such as for example electric and hydrogen-powered vehicles autonomous systems smart mobility platforms and energy-efficient infrastructure Patenting activities are an indicator of technological innovation highlighting areas where researchers and companies are investing time and resources Patenting in the future of transportation has seen substantial growth with an increase from around to almost published patent families between and Sustainable propulsion is at the forefront of reducing the environmental footprint of transportation with research and patenting in batteries efficient aircraft turbines for air transport efficient ship design for sea transport electric propulsion hydrogen fuel cells and sustainable fuels Automation and circularity focus on streamlining production with more efficient processes reduction of waste or recycling Communication and security technologies are meant for a safer more connected and responsive to dynamic conditions transportation systems It includes innovations such as lidar sensors G networks connected vehicles smart city infrastructure or smart port Sustainable propulsion and communication and security technologies represent the largest number of patent publication increase between and Sustainable propulsion is the most patented technology in land and sea transport whilst communication and security represent over of the patents in space transport Share of firms in the EU and the US taking action on climate by including sustainable transport options Tools and incentives edit Anthropogenic per capita emissions of greenhouse gases by country by the year Several European countries are opening up financial incentives that support more sustainable modes of transport The European Cyclists Federation which focuses on daily cycling for transport has created a document containing a non-complete overview In the UK employers have for many years been providing employees with financial incentives The employee leases or borrows a bike that the employer has purchased You can also get other support The scheme is beneficial for the employee who saves money and gets an incentive to get exercise integrated in the daily routine The employer can expect a tax deduction lower sick leave and less pressure on parking spaces for cars Since there has been a scheme in Iceland Samg ngugrei slur where those who do not drive a car to work get paid a lump of money monthly An employee must sign a statement not to use a car for work more often than one day a week or of the days for a period Some employers pay fixed amounts based on trust Other employers reimburse the expenses for repairs on bicycles period-tickets for public transport and the like Since amounts up to ISK per month have been tax-free Most major workplaces offer this and a significant proportion of employees use the scheme Since half the amount is tax-free if the employee signs a contract not to use a car to work for more than of the days of the contract period Possible measures for urban transport edit The EU Directorate-General for Transport and Energy DG-TREN has launched a program which focusses mostly on urban transport Its main measures are Clean fuels and vehicles Animal-powered transport Biodiesel Biogas CNG Electric vehicles Human-powered transport Hybrid vehicles Hydrogen vehicle LPG Sailing ships Sustainable green transport infrastructure Bikeways Busways Greenways and foreshoreways Railways Access restrictions Access management enforcement Car restricted zones living streets Multifunctional areas Parking management Pedestrian zone Traffic calming speed reduction Integrated pricing strategies Congestion pricing Integrated ticketing Parking management Collective passenger transport Accessible transport systems Bus rapid transit

oriented development Transportation demand management Walkability Sustainable freight transport Clean vehicles clean fleet Dry port Fleet management Intermodal freight transport Route planning Transportation management system History edit Further information History of transport Most of the tools and concepts of sustainable transport were developed before the phrase was coined Walking the first mode of transport is also the most sustainable Public transport dates back at least as far as the invention of the public bus by Blaise Pascal in The first passenger tram began operation in and the first passenger rail service in Pedal bicycles date from the s These were the only personal transport choices available to most people in Western countries prior to World War II and remain the only options for most people in the developing world Freight was moved by human power animal power or rail Mass motorization edit The post-war years brought increased wealth and a demand for much greater mobility for people and goods The number of road vehicles in Britain increased fivefold between and with similar trends in other Western nations Most affluent countries and cities invested heavily in bigger and better-designed roads and motorways which were considered essential to underpin growth and prosperity Transport planning became a branch of Urban Planning and identified induced demand as a pivotal change from predict and provide toward a sustainable approach incorporating land use planning and public transit Public investment in transit walking and cycling declined dramatically in the United States Great Britain and Australia although this did not occur to the same extent in Canada or mainland Europe Concerns about the sustainability of this approach became widespread during the oil crisis and the energy crisis The high cost and limited availability of fuel led to a resurgence of interest in alternatives to single occupancy vehicle travel Transport innovations dating from this period include high-occupancy vehicle lanes citywide carpool systems and transportation demand management Singapore was the first country in the world to implement congestion pricing in and Curitiba began implementing its Bus Rapid Transit system in the early s Relatively low and stable oil prices during the s and s led to significant increases in vehicle travel from to both directly because people chose to travel by car more often and for greater distances and indirectly because cities developed tracts of suburban housing distant from shops and from workplaces now referred to as urban sprawl Trends in freight logistics including a movement from rail and coastal shipping to road freight and a requirement for just in time deliveries meant that freight traffic grew faster than general vehicle traffic At the same time the academic foundations of the predict and provide approach to transport were being questioned notably by Peter Newman in a set of comparative studies of cities and their transport systems dating from the mid- s The British Government s White Paper on Transport marked a change in direction for transport planning in the UK In the introduction to the White Paper Prime Minister Tony Blair stated that We recognise that we cannot simply build our way out of the problems we face It would be environmentally irresponsible and would not work A companion document to the White Paper called Smarter Choices researched the potential to scale up the small and scattered sustainable transport initiatives then occurring across Britain and concluded that the comprehensive application of these techniques could reduce peak period car travel in urban areas by over A similar study by the United States Federal Highway Administration was also released in and also concluded that a more proactive approach to transportation demand was an important component of overall national transport strategy Mobility transition edit This section is an excerpt from Mobility transition edit Hermann Knoflacher has been criticising auto cities and car dependency for decades With his walkmobile he caricatures the enormous spatial demands of motorised private transport Mobility transition is a set of social technological and political processes of converting traffic including freight transport and mobility to sustainable transport with renewable energy resources and an integration of several different modes of private transport and local public transport It also includes social change a redistribution of public spaces and different ways of financing and spending money in urban planning The main motivation for mobility transition is the reduction of the harm and damage that traffic causes to people mostly but not solely due to collisions and the environment which also often directly or indirectly affects people in order to make urban society more livable as well as solving various interconnected logistical social economic and energy issues and inefficiencies Mobility went through many transitions in the th and th centuries Canal boats Steam railways and bicycles largely replaced journeys afoot and by horse and steamships replaced sailing ships Each later changed to internal combustion engines and in the case of many railways electricity They in turn were partly replaced by automobile transport and aviation See also edit Alternatives to car use Circular economy Cyclability Ecological modernization Electric bicycle Energy efficiency in transport Environmental impact of aviation Environmental

transport Tram Rapid transit Personal rapid transit Category Renewable energy portal v t e A green vehicle clean vehicle eco-friendly vehicle or environmentally friendly vehicle is a road motor vehicle that produces less harmful impacts to the environment than comparable conventional internal combustion engine vehicles running on gasoline or diesel or one that uses certain alternative fuels Presently in some countries the term is used for any vehicle complying or surpassing the more stringent European emission standards such as Euro or California s zero-emissions vehicle standards such as ZEV ULEV SULEV PZEV or the low-carbon fuel standards enacted in several countries Green vehicles can be powered by alternative fuels and advanced vehicle technologies and include hybrid electric vehicles plug-in hybrid electric vehicles battery electric vehicles compressed-air vehicles hydrogen and fuel-cell vehicles neat ethanol vehicles flexible-fuel vehicles natural gas vehicles clean diesel vehicles and some sources also include vehicles using blends of biodiesel and ethanol fuel or gasohol In with an EPA -rated fuel economy of miles per gallon gasoline equivalent mpg-e L km the Tesla Model Standard Range Plus RWD became the most efficient EPA-certified vehicle considering all fuels and all years surpassing the Tesla Model Standard Range Plus and Hyundai Ioniq Electric Several authors also include conventional motor vehicles with high fuel economy as they consider that increasing fuel economy is the most cost-effective way to improve energy efficiency and reduce carbon emissions in the transport sector in the short run As part of their contribution to sustainable transport these vehicles reduce air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions and contribute to energy independence by reducing oil imports An environmental analysis extends beyond just the operating efficiency and emissions A life-cycle assessment involves production and post-use considerations A cradle-to-cradle design is more important than a focus on a single factor such as energy efficiency Energy efficiency edit Main article Energy efficiency in transport Cars with similar production of energy costs can be obtained during the life of the car operational phase large reductions in energy costs through several measures The most significant is by using alternative propulsion An efficient engine that reduces the vehicle s consumption of petroleum i e petroleum electric hybrid vehicle or that uses renewable energy sources throughout its working life Using biofuels instead of petroleum fuels Proper maintenance of a vehicle such as engine tune-ups oil changes and maintaining proper tire pressure can also help Removing unnecessary items from a vehicle reduces weight and improves fuel economy as well Comparison of several types of green car basic characteristics Values are overall for vehicles in current production and may differ between types Type of vehicle powertrain Fuel

source - All-electric Shorter mi Luxury models Medium mi High Very high varies depending on energy source - Hydrogen fuel cell Astronomical Hybrid electric mi Medium years Types edit Comparison of energy efficiency between battery and hydrogen fuel-cell cars Sales of both the Chevrolet Volt plug-in hybrid top and the Nissan Leaf all-electric car bottom began in December PSA Peugeot Citro n Hybrid Air concept exhibited at the Geneva Motor Show Further information Alternative fuel vehicle Green vehicles include vehicles types that function fully or partly on alternative energy sources other than fossil fuel or less carbon-intensive than gasoline or diesel Another option is the use of alternative fuel composition in conventional fossil fuel-based vehicles making them function partially on renewable energy sources Other approaches include personal rapid transit a public transportation concept that offers automated on-demand and non-stop transportation on a network of specially built guideways Electric and fuel cell-powered edit See also Electric vehicle and Plug-in hybrid Examples of vehicles with reduced petroleum consumption include electric cars plug-in hybrids and fuel cell -powered hydrogen cars are provided to the right Electric cars are typically more efficient than fuel cell -powered vehicles on a Tank-to-wheel basis They have better fuel economy than conventional internal combustion engine vehicles but are hampered by range or maximum distance attainable before discharging the battery The electric car batteries are their main cost They provide a to reduction in CO emissions compared to an ICE gasoline diesel vehicle depending on the source of electricity Hybrid electric vehicles edit See also Hybrid vehicle Hybrid cars may be partly fossil fuel or biofuel powered and partly electric or hydrogen-powered Most combine an internal combustion engine with an electric engine though other variations too exist The internal combustion engine is often either a gasoline or Diesel engine in rare cases a Stirling engine may even be used They are more expensive to purchase but cost redemption is achieved in a period of about years due to better fuel economy Compressed air cars Stirling vehicles and others edit See also Compressed-air vehicle and Compressed air car Compressed air cars Stirling powered vehicles and liquid nitrogen vehicles are less polluting than electrical vehicles since the vehicle and its components are environment friendly citation needed Solar car races are held on a regular basis in order to promote green vehicles and other green technology These sleek driver-only vehicles can travel long distances at highway speeds using only the electricity generated from the sun Improving conventional cars edit The Fiat Siena Tetrafuel is a multifuel car designed to run as a flex-fuel on gasoline or E E blend or neat ethanol E or to run as a bi-fuel with natural gas CNG Main articles Biofuel compressed natural gas and clean diesel See also Volkswagen emissions scandal A conventional vehicle can become a greener vehicle by mixing in renewable fuels or using less carbon intensive fossil fuel Typical gasoline -powered cars can tolerate up to ethanol Brazil manufactured cars that run on neat ethanol though there were discontinued Another available option is a flexible-fuel vehicle which allows any blend of gasoline and ethanol up to in North America and Europe and up to in Brazil Another existing option is to convert a conventional gasoline-powered to allow the alternative use of CNG Pakistan Argentina Brazil Iran India Italy and China have the largest fleets of natural gas vehicles in the world Diesel -powered vehicles can often transition completely to biodiesel though the fuel is a very strong solvent which can occasionally damage rubber seals in vehicles built before More commonly however biodiesel causes problems simply because it removes all of the built-up residue in an engine clogging filters unless care is taken when switching from dirty fossil-fuel derived diesel to bio-diesel It is very effective at de-coking the diesel engines combustion chambers and keeping them clean Biodiesel is the lowest emission fuel available for diesel engines Diesel engines are the most efficient car internal combustion engines Biodiesel is the only fuel allowed in some North American national parks because spillages will completely bio-degrade within days Biodiesel and vegetable oil fuelled diesel engined vehicles have been declared amongst the greenest in the US Tour de Sol competition This presents problems as biofuels can use food resources in order to provide mechanical energy for vehicles Many experts point to this as a reason for growing food prices particularly US Bio-ethanol fuel production which has affected maize prices In order to have a low environmental impact biofuels should be made only from waste products or from new sources like algae Electric Motor and Pedal Powered Vehicles edit Multiple companies are offering and developing two three and four wheel vehicles combining the characteristics of a bicycle with electric motors US Federal State and Local laws do not clearly nor consistently classify these vehicles as bicycles electric bicycles motorcycles electric motorcycles mopeds Neighborhood Electric Vehicle motorised quadricycle or as a car Some laws have limits on top speeds power of the motors range etc while others do not Other edit Further information Personal rapid transit Solar vehicle Public transportation vehicles are not usually included in the green vehicle category but Personal rapid transit PRT vehicles probably should be All vehicles that are powered from the track have the advantage of potentially being able to use any source of electric energy including sustainable ones rather than requiring liquid fuels They can also switch regenerative braking energy between vehicles and the electric grid rather than requiring energy storage on the vehicles Also they can potentially use the entire track area for solar collectors not just the vehicle surface The potential PRT energy efficiency is much higher than that which traditional automobiles can attain Solar vehicles are electric vehicles powered by solar energy obtained from solar panels on the surface generally the roof of the vehicle Photovoltaic PV cells convert the Sun s energy directly into electrical energy Solar vehicles are not practical day-to-day transportation devices at present but are primarily demonstration vehicles and engineering exercises often sponsored by government agencies However some cities have begun offering solar-powered buses including the Tindo in Adelaide Australia Wind-powered electric vehicles primarily use wind-turbines installed at a strategic point of the vehicle which are then converted into electric energy which causes the vehicle to propel Animal powered vehicles edit Horse and carriage are just one type of animal propelled vehicle Once a common form of transportation they became far less common as cities grew and automobiles took their place In dense cities the waste produced by large numbers of transportation animals was a significant health problem Oftentimes the food is produced for them using diesel powered tractors and thus there is some environmental impact as a result of their use Human powered vehicles edit V lo v bicycle sharing system in Lyon France See also Bicycle sharing system Human-powered transport includes walking bicycles velomobiles row boats and more environmentally friendly ways of getting around In addition to the health benefits of the exercise provided they are far more environmentally friendly than most other options The only downside is the speed limitations and how far one can travel before getting exhausted Benefits of green vehicle use edit Environmental edit Vehicle emissions contribute to the increasing concentration of gases linked to climate change In order of significance the principal greenhouse gases associated with road transport are carbon dioxide CO methane CH and nitrous oxide N O Road transport is the third largest source of greenhouse gases emitted in the UK and accounts for about of total emissions and in the United States Of the total greenhouse gas emissions from transport over are due to CO emissions from road vehicles The transport sector is the fastest growing source of greenhouse gases Health edit Vehicle pollutants have been linked to human ill health including the incidence of respiratory and cardiopulmonary disease and lung cancer A report estimated that up to people die prematurely each year in the UK as a direct result of air pollution According to the World Health Organization up to deaths per year among children aged years across Europe are directly attributable to outdoor pollution The organization estimates that if pollution levels were returned to within EU limits more than of these lives could be saved each year Monetary edit Hybrid taxi fleet operators in New York have also reported that reduced fuel consumption saves them thousands of dollars per year Criticism edit A study by CNW Marketing Research suggested that the extra energy cost of manufacture shipping disposal and the short lives of some of these types of vehicle particularly gas-electric hybrid vehicles outweighs any energy savings made by their using less petroleum during their useful lifespan This type of argument is the long smokestack argument Critics of the report note that the study prorated all of Toyota s hybrid research-and-development costs across the relatively small number of Priuses on the road rather than using the incremental cost of building a vehicle used miles km for the length of life of a Prius Toyota offers a -mile km warranty on the Prius hybrid components including the battery and calculated that a majority of a car s cradle-to-grave energy gets expended during the vehicle s production not while it is driven Norwegian Consumer Ombudsman official Bente verli stated that cars cannot do anything good for the environment except less damage than others Based on this opinion Norwegian law severely restricts the use of greenwashing to market automobiles strongly prohibiting advertising a vehicle as being environmentally friendly with large fines issued to violators Some studies try to compare environmental impact of electric and petrol vehicles over complete life cycle including production operation and dismantling In general results differ vastly dependent on the region considered due to difference in energy sources to produce electricity that fuels electric vehicles When considering only CO emissions it is noted that production of electric cars generate about twice as much emissions as that of internal combustion cars However emissions of CO during operation are much larger on average than during production For electric cars emissions caused during operation depend on energy sources used to produce electricity and thus vary a lot geographically Studies suggest that when taking into account both production and operation electric cars would cause more emissions in economies where production of electricity is not clean e g it is mostly coal based For this reason some studies found that driving electric cars is less environmentally damaging in western US states than in eastern ones where less electricity is produced using cleaner sources Similarly in countries like India Australia or China where large portion of electricity is produced by using coal driving electric vehicles would cause larger environmental damage than driving petrol vehicles When justifying use of electric cars over petrol cars these kinds of studies do not provide sufficiently clear results Environmental impact is calculated based on fuel mix used to produce electricity that powers electric cars However when a gas vehicle is replaced by an equivalent electric vehicle additional power must be installed in electrical grid This additional capacity would normally not be based on the same ratios of energy sources clean versus fossil fuels than the current capacity Only when additional electricity production capacity installed to switch from petrol to electric vehicles would predominantly consist of clean sources switch to electric vehicles could reduce environmental damage Another common problem in methodology used in comparative studies is that it only focuses on specific kinds of environmental impact While some studies focus only on emission of gas pollutants over life cycle or only on greenhouse gas emissions such as CO comparison should also account for other environmental impacts such as pollutants released otherwise during production and operation or ingredients that can not be effectively recycled Examples include use of lighter high performing metals lithium batteries and more rare metals in electric cars which all have high environmental impact A study that also looked at factors other than energy consumption and carbon emissions has suggested that there is no such thing as an environmentally friendly car The use of vehicles with increased fuel efficiency is usually considered positive in the short term but criticism of any hydrocarbon-based personal transport remains The Jevons paradox suggests that energy efficiency programs are often counter-productive even increasing energy consumption in the long run Many environmental researchers believe that sustainable transport may require a move away from hydrocarbon fuels and from our present automobile and highway paradigm National and international promotion edit European Union edit The European Union is promoting the marketing of greener cars via a combination of binding and non-binding measures As of September of the member states of the European Union provide tax incentives for electrically chargeable vehicles and some alternative fuel vehicles which includes all EU countries except Germany Denmark Italy Finland Slovakia Bulgaria Latvia and Romania The incentives consist of tax reductions and exemptions as well as of bonus payments for buyers of electric cars plug-in hybrids hybrid electric vehicles and natural gas vehicles United States edit The United States Environmental Protection Agency EPA is promoting the marketing of greener cars via the SmartWay program The SmartWay and SmartWay Elite designation mean that a vehicle is a better environmental performer relative to other vehicles This US EPA designation is arrived at by taking into account a vehicle s Air Pollution Score and Greenhouse Gas Score Higher Air Pollution Scores indicate vehicles that emit lower amounts of pollutants that cause smog relative to other vehicles Higher Greenhouse Gas Scores indicate vehicles that emit lower amounts of carbon dioxide and have improved fuel economy relative to other vehicles To earn the SmartWay designation a vehicle must earn at least a on the Air Pollution Score and at least a on the Greenhouse Gas Score but have a combined score of at least SmartWay Elite is given to those vehicles that score or better on both the Greenhouse Gas and Air Pollution Scores A Green Vehicle Marketing Alliance in conjunction with the Oak Ridge National Laboratory ORNL

transportation vehicles For electric automobiles see Electric car For other uses of the term EV see EV This article duplicates the scope of other articles specifically Electric car Please discuss this issue and help introduce a summary style to the article March Electric vehicles around the world left to right from top Electric car a BMW i charging from a standard electrical outlet Electric

on the San yo Shinkansen Japan Battery electric bus a BYD bus in Landskrona Sweden E-bike a Geero with the removable battery integrated into the down tube Electric truck Class a Tesla Semi in Rocklin California Electric cart an Italcar Attiva C S An electric vehicle EV is any motorized vehicle whose propulsion is provided fully or mostly by electric power via grid electricity or from onboard rechargeable batteries EVs encompass a wide range of transportation modes including road electric cars buses trucks and personal transporters and rail vehicles electric trains trams and monorails electric boats and submersibles electric aircraft both fixed-wing and multirotors and electric spacecraft Early electric vehicles first came into existence in the late th century when the Second Industrial Revolution brought forth electrification and mass utilization of DC and AC electric motors Using electricity was among the preferred methods for early motor vehicle propulsion as it provided a level of quietness comfort and ease of operation that could not be achieved by the gasoline engine cars of the time but range anxiety due to the limited energy storage offered by contemporary battery technologies hindered any mass adoption of electric vehicles as private transportation throughout the th century Internal combustion engines both gasoline and diesel engines were the dominant propulsion mechanisms for cars and trucks for about years but electricity-powered locomotion remained commonplace in other vehicle types such as overhead line -powered mass transit vehicles like electric multiple units streetcars monorails and trolley buses as well as various small low-speed short-range battery-powered personal vehicles such as mobility scooters Since the late th century technological advancement in lithium batteries which offer superior energy density and current output than the prior lead-acid batteries has revived public interests in electric vehicles as zero-emission vehicle options although most plug-in electric vehicles made during the s that are not neighborhood electric vehicles had very short market runs before being discontinued completely Manufacturers mostly switched to hybrid electric vehicles that use internal combustions engines like conventional vehicles but also have electric motors as a supplement which are powered by electricity produced internally by motor-generators and recovered from regenerative braking Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles which can be recharged from an electric grid and use electric motors as the primary propulsion rather than as a supplement to combustion engines did not see any mass production until the late s and battery electric cars did not become practical options for the consumer market

Technological progresses in electric vehicle batteries electric traction motors and automotive electronics particularly electronic control units has made electric cars more feasible and in some cases more cost efficient than conventional ICE vehicles during the st century with market penetration in some countries like China reaching nearly half of all new vehicles sold As a means of reducing tailpipe emissions of greenhouse gases and other air pollutants and to reduce the dependency on fossil fuels government incentives are also available in many areas to promote the adoption of electric cars History edit Main article History of the electric vehicle Electric motive power started in when Hungarian priest nyos Jedlik built the first rudimentary yet functional electric motor the next year he used it to power a small model car In Professor Sibrandus Stratingh of the University of Groningen in the Netherlands built a miniature electric vehicle car and sometime between and Robert Anderson of Scotland invented the first crude electric carriage powered by non-rechargeable primary cells American blacksmith and inventor Thomas Davenport built a toy electric locomotive powered by a primitive electric motor in In a Scotsman named Robert Davidson built an electric locomotive that attained a speed of four miles per hour km h In England a patent was granted in for the use of rails as conductors of electric current and similar American patents were issued to Lilley and Colten in Thomas Edison and George Meister in a Studebaker electric runabout The first mass-produced electric vehicles appeared in America in the early s In the Studebaker Automobile Company entered the automotive business with electric vehicles though it also entered the gasoline vehicles market in However with the advent of cheap assembly line cars by Ford Motor Company the popularity of electric cars declined significantly Due to a lack of electricity grids and the limitations of storage batteries at that time electric cars did not gain much popularity however electric trains gained immense popularity due to their economies and achievable speeds By the th century electric rail transport became commonplace due to advances in the development of electric locomotives Over time the general-purpose commercial use of electric cars was reduced to specialist roles as platform trucks forklift trucks ambulances tow tractors and urban delivery vehicles such as the iconic British milk float For most of the th century the UK was the world s largest user of electric road vehicles Electrified trains were used for coal transport as the motors did not use the valuable oxygen in the mines Switzerland s lack of natural fossil resources forced the rapid electrification of their rail network One of the earliest rechargeable batteries the nickel iron battery was favored by Edison for use in electric cars EVs were among the earliest automobiles and before the preeminence of light powerful internal combustion engines ICEs electric automobiles held many vehicle land speed and distance records in the early s They were produced by Baker Electric Columbia Electric Detroit Electric and others and at one point in history outsold gasoline-powered vehicles In percent of the cars on the road in the US were electric EVs were so popular that even President Woodrow Wilson and his secret service agents toured Washington D C in their Milburn Electrics which covered miles km per charge A charging station in Seattle shows an AMC Gremlin modified to take electric power it had a range of about miles km on one charge Most producers of passenger cars opted for gasoline cars in the first decade of the th century but electric trucks were an established niche well into the s Several developments contributed to a decline in the popularity of electric cars Improved road infrastructure required a greater range than that offered by electric cars and the discovery of large reserves of petroleum in Texas Oklahoma and California led to the wide availability of affordable gasoline petrol making internal combustion powered cars cheaper to operate over long distances Electric vehicles were seldom marketed as women s luxury car which may have been a stigma among male consumers Also internal combustion-powered cars became ever-easier to operate thanks to the invention of the electric starter by Charles Kettering in which eliminated the need of a hand crank for starting a gasoline engine and the noise emitted by ICE cars became more bearable thanks to the use of the muffler which Hiram Percy Maxim had invented in As roads were improved outside urban areas the electric vehicle range could not compete with the ICE Finally the initiation of mass production of gasoline-powered vehicles by Henry Ford in significantly reduced the cost of gasoline cars as compared to electric cars In the s National City Lines which was a partnership of General Motors Firestone and Standard Oil of California purchased many electric tram networks across the country to dismantle them and replace them with GM buses The partnership was convicted of conspiring to monopolize the sale of equipment and supplies to their subsidiary companies Still it was acquitted of conspiring to monopolize the provision of transportation services The Copenhagen Summit conducted amid a severe observable climate change brought on by human-made greenhouse gas emissions was held in During the summit more than countries developed plans to reach net zero eventually For many countries adopting more EVs will help reduce the use of gasoline In recent years the market for electric off-road motorcycles including dirt bikes has seen significant growth This trend is driven by advancements in battery technology and increasing demand for recreational electric vehicles Experimentation edit General Motors EV electric car a subject of the film Who Killed the Electric Car In January General Motors President introduced its EV concept two-seater the Impact at the Los Angeles Auto Show That September the California Air Resources Board mandated major-automaker sales of EVs in phases starting in From to GM produced EV s of which were made available through three-year leases Chrysler Ford GM Honda and Toyota also produced limited numbers of EVs for California drivers during this period In upon the expiration of GM s EV leases GM discontinued them The discontinuation has variously been attributed to the auto industry s successful federal court challenge to California s zero-emissions vehicle mandate a federal regulation requiring GM to produce and maintain spare parts for the few thousand EV s and the success of the oil and auto industries media campaign to reduce public acceptance of EVs A movie made on the subject in was titled Who Killed the Electric Car and released theatrically by Sony Pictures Classics in The film explores the roles of automobile manufacturers oil industry the U S government batteries hydrogen vehicles and the general public and each of their roles in limiting the deployment and adoption of this technology Ford released a number of their Ford Ecostar delivery vans into the market Honda Nissan and Toyota also repossessed and crushed most of their EVs which like the GM EV s had been available only by closed-end lease After public protests Toyota sold of its RAV EVs they later sold at over their original forty-thousand-dollar price Later BMW of Canada sold off a number of Mini EVs when their Canadian testing ended The production of the Citro n Berlingo Electrique stopped in September Zenn started production in but ended by Reintroduction edit The global stock of both plug-in hybrid electric vehicles PHEVs and battery electric vehicles BEVs has grown steadily since the s Sales of passenger electric vehicles EVs worldwide since During the late th and early st century the environmental impact of the petroleum-based transportation infrastructure along with the fear of peak oil led to renewed interest in electric transportation infrastructure EVs differ from fossil fuel -powered vehicles in that the electricity they consume can be generated from a wide range of sources including fossil fuels nuclear power and renewables such as solar power and wind power or any combination of those Recent advancements in battery technology and charging infrastructure have addressed many of the earlier barriers to EV adoption making electric vehicles a more viable option for a wider range of consumers The carbon footprint and other emissions of electric vehicles vary depending on the fuel and technology used for electricity generation The electricity may be stored in the vehicle using a battery flywheel or supercapacitors Vehicles using internal combustion engines usually only derive their energy from a single or a few sources usually non-renewable fossil fuels A key advantage of electric vehicles is regenerative braking which recovers kinetic energy typically lost during friction braking as heat as electricity restored to the on-board battery According to the International Energy Agency s Global EV Outlook more than million new electric cars were sold worldwide in representing around of total car sales for the year Electricity sources edit EVs are much more efficient than fossil fuel vehicles and have few direct emissions At the same time they do rely on electrical energy that is generally provided by a combination of non-fossil fuel plants and fossil fuel plants There are many ways to generate electricity of varying costs efficiency and ecological desirability EVs can be made less polluting overall by modifying the source of electricity In some areas persons can ask utilities to provide their electricity from renewable energy Therefore it gives the greatest degree of energy resilience A passenger train taking power through a third rail with return through the traction rails An electric locomotive at Brig Switzerland The MAZ- uses an on-board generator to power in-wheel electric motors Connection to generator plants edit Direct connection to electric grids as is common among electric trains trams trolleybuses and trolleytrucks See also overhead lines third rail and conduit current collection Online electric vehicle collects power from electric power strips buried under the road surface through electromagnetic induction Onboard generators and hybrid EVs edit See also Diesel electric transmission Petrol electric transmission and Hybrid vehicle Generated on-board using a diesel engine diesel electric locomotive and diesel electric multiple unit DEMU Generated on-board using a fuel cell fuel cell vehicle Generated on-board using nuclear energy nuclear submarines and aircraft carriers Renewable sources such as solar power solar vehicle It is also possible to have hybrid EVs that derive electricity from multiple sources such as On-board rechargeable electricity storage system RESS and a direct continuous connection to land-based generation plants for purposes of on-highway recharging with unrestricted highway range On-board rechargeable electricity storage system and a fueled propulsion power source internal combustion engine plug-in hybrid For especially large EVs such as submarines the chemical energy of the diesel electric can be replaced by a nuclear reactor The nuclear reactor usually provides heat which drives a steam turbine which drives a generator which is then fed to the propulsion See Nuclear marine propulsion A few experimental vehicles such as some cars and a handful of aircraft use solar panels for electricity Onboard storage edit Fuel use in vehicle designs Vehicle type Fuel used Combustion-only vehicle ICE Exclusively uses petroleum or other fuel Micro hybrid electric vehicle HEV Exclusively uses petroleum or other fuel but can shut off engine to consume less Mild hybrid electric vehicle MHEV BAHV Exclusively uses petroleum or other fuel but has electric battery to consume less Plug-in hybrid vehicle PHEV Uses mixture of petroleum or other fuel and electricity from power grid All-electric vehicle BEV AEV Exclusively uses electricity from power grid Fuel cell vehicle FCV FCEV Exclusively uses hydrogen or other fuel to generate electricity v t e These systems are powered from an external generator plant nearly always when stationary and then disconnected before motion occurs and the electricity is stored in the vehicle until needed Full Electric Vehicles FEV Power storage methods include Chemical energy stored on the vehicle in on-board batteries Battery electric vehicle BEV typically with a lithium-ion battery Kinetic energy storage flywheels Static energy stored on the vehicle in on-board electric double-layer capacitors Batteries electric double-layer capacitors and flywheel energy storage are forms of rechargeable on-board electricity storage systems By avoiding an intermediate mechanical step the energy conversion efficiency can be improved compared to hybrids by avoiding unnecessary energy conversions Furthermore electro-chemical batteries conversions are reversible allowing electrical energy to be stored in chemical form Components edit The type of battery the type of traction motor and the motor controller design vary according to the size power and proposed application which can be as small as a motorized shopping cart or wheelchair through pedelecs electric motorcycles and scooters neighborhood electric vehicles industrial fork-lift trucks and including many hybrid vehicles Battery edit Main article Electric vehicle battery A lithium-ion battery pack of the Nissan Leaf An electric-vehicle battery EVB in addition to the traction battery specialty systems used for industrial or recreational vehicles are batteries used to power the propulsion system of a battery electric vehicle BEVs These batteries are usually a secondary rechargeable battery and are typically lithium-ion batteries Traction batteries specifically designed with a high ampere-hour capacity are used in forklifts electric golf carts riding floor scrubbers electric motorcycles electric cars trucks vans and other electric vehicles Lithium-ion battery edit Battery prices fell given economies of scale and new cell chemistries improving energy density However general inflationary pressures and rising costs of raw materials and components inhibited price declines in the early s Main article Electric vehicle battery Since their first commercial release in lithium-ion batteries have become an important technology for achieving low-carbon transportation systems Most electric vehicles use lithium-ion batteries Li-Ions or LIBs Lithium-ion batteries have a higher energy density longer life span and higher power density than most other practical batteries Complicating factors include safety durability thermal breakdown environmental impact and cost Li-ion batteries should be used within safe temperature and voltage ranges to operate safely and efficiently Increasing the battery s lifespan decreases effective costs and environmental impact One technique is to operate a subset of the battery cells at a time and switching these subsets In the past nickel metal hydride batteries were used in some electric cars such as those made by General Motors These battery types are considered outdated due to their tendencies to self-discharge in the heat Furthermore a patent for this type of battery was held by Chevron which created a problem for their widespread development These factors coupled with their high cost has led to lithium-ion batteries leading as the predominant battery for EVs The prices of lithium-ion batteries have declined dramatically over the past decade contributing to a reduction in price for electric vehicles but an increase in the price of critical minerals such as lithium from to the end of has put pressure on historical battery price decreases Electric motor edit Electric truck e-Force One Main article Traction motor The power of a vehicle s electric motor as in other machines is measured in kilowatts kW Electric motors can deliver their maximum torque over a wide RPM range This means that the performance of a vehicle with a kW electric motor exceeds that of a vehicle with a kW internal combustion engine which can only deliver its maximum torque within a limited range of engine speed Efficiency of charging varies considerably depending on the type of charger and energy is lost during the process of converting the electrical energy to mechanical energy Usually direct current DC electricity is fed into a DC AC inverter where it is converted to alternating current AC electricity and this AC electricity is connected to a -phase AC motor For electric trains forklift trucks and some electric cars DC motors are often used In some cases universal motors are used and then AC or DC may be employed In recent production vehicles various motor types have been implemented for instance induction motors within Tesla Motor vehicles and permanent magnet machines in the Nissan Leaf and Chevrolet Bolt Energy and motors edit An electric powertrain used by Power Vehicle Innovation for trucks or buses Tesla Model S drive motor Mounted on chassis Cutaway view Electric motors are mechanically very simple and often achieve energy conversion efficiency over the full range of speeds and power output and can be precisely controlled Motion is provided by a rotary electric motor However it is possible to unroll the motor to drive directly against a special matched track These linear motors are used in maglev trains which float above the rails supported by magnetic levitation This allows for almost no rolling resistance of the vehicle and no mechanical wear and tear of the train or track In addition to the high-performance control systems needed switching and curving of the tracks becomes difficult with linear motors which to date has restricted their operations to high-speed point to point services Electric traction allows the use of regenerative braking in which the motors are used as brakes and become generators that transform the motion of usually a train into electrical power that is then fed back into the lines This system is particularly advantageous in mountainous operations as descending vehicles can produce a large portion of the power required for those ascending and in start-and-stop city use This regenerative system is only viable if the system is large enough to use the power generated by descending vehicles They can be finely controlled and provide high torque from stationary-to-moving unlike internal combustion engines and do not need multiple gears to match power curves This removes the need for gearboxes and torque converters EVs provide quiet and smooth operation and consequently have less noise and vibration than internal combustion engines While this is a desirable attribute it has also evoked concern that the absence of the usual sounds of an approaching vehicle poses a danger to blind elderly and very young pedestrians To mitigate this situation many countries mandate warning sounds when EVs are moving slowly up to a speed when normal motion and rotation road suspension electric motor etc noises become audible Electric motors do not require oxygen unlike internal combustion engines this is useful for submarines and for space rovers Vehicle types edit Neighborhood Electric Vehicle Squad Solar NEV with solar panel roof It is generally possible to equip any kind of vehicle with an electric power-train Electric ground vehicles edit Pure-electric vehicles edit See also Electric car and Battery electric vehicle A pure-electric vehicle or all-electric vehicle is powered exclusively through electric motors The electricity may come from a battery battery electric vehicle solar panel solar vehicle or fuel cell fuel cell vehicle Hybrid electric vehicles edit This section is an excerpt from Hybrid electric vehicle edit A hybrid electric vehicle HEV is a type of hybrid vehicle that couples a conventional internal combustion engine ICE with one or more electric engines into a combined propulsion system The presence of the electric powertrain which has inherently better energy conversion efficiency is intended to achieve either better fuel economy or better acceleration performance than a conventional vehicle There is a variety of HEV types and the degree to which each functions as an electric vehicle EV also varies The most common form of HEV is hybrid electric passenger cars although hybrid electric trucks pickups tow trucks and tractors buses motorboats and aircraft also exist Modern HEVs use energy recovery technologies such as motor generator units and regenerative braking to recycle the vehicle s kinetic energy to electric energy via an alternator which is stored in a battery pack or a supercapacitor Some varieties of HEV use an internal combustion engine to directly drive an electrical generator which either recharges the vehicle s batteries or directly powers the electric traction motors this combination is known as a range extender Many HEVs reduce idle emissions by temporarily shutting down the combustion engine at idle such as when waiting at the traffic light and restarting it when needed this is known as a start-stop system A hybrid-electric system produces less tailpipe emissions than a comparably sized petrol engine vehicle since the hybrid s petrol engine usually has smaller displacement and thus lower fuel consumption than that of a conventional petrol-powered vehicle If the engine is not used to drive the car directly it can be geared to run at maximum efficiency further improving fuel economy There are different ways that a hybrid electric vehicle can combine the power from an electric motor and the internal combustion engine The most common type is a parallel hybrid that connects the engine and the electric motor to the wheels through mechanical coupling In this scenario the electric motor and the engine can drive the wheels directly Series hybrids only use the electric motor to drive the wheels and can often be referred to as extended-range electric vehicles EREVs or range-extended electric vehicles REEVs There are also series parallel hybrids where the vehicle can be powered by the engine working alone the electric motor on its own or by both working together this is designed so that the engine can run at its optimum range as often as possible Plug-in electric vehicle edit Main article Plug-in electric vehicle See also Plug-in hybrid and Electric car A plug-in electric vehicle PEV is any motor vehicle that can be recharged from any external source of electricity such as wall sockets and the electricity stored in the Rechargeable battery packs drives or contributes to drive the wheels PEV is a subcategory of electric vehicles that includes battery electric vehicles BEVs plug-in hybrid vehicles PHEVs and electric vehicle conversions of hybrid electric vehicles and conventional internal combustion engine vehicles Range-extended electric vehicle edit See also Range extender A range-extended electric vehicle REEV is a vehicle powered by an electric motor and a plug-in battery An auxiliary combustion engine is used only to supplement battery charging and not as the primary source of power On- and off-road EVs edit On-road electric vehicles include electric cars electric trolleybuses electric buses battery electric buses electric trucks electric bicycles electric motorcycles and scooters personal transporters neighborhood electric vehicles golf carts milk floats and forklifts Off-road vehicles include electrified all-terrain vehicles and electric tractors Electric trucks edit Electric Renault Midlum used by Nestl in An electric truck is a battery electric vehicle BEV designed to transport cargo carry specialized payloads or perform other utilitarian work Electric trucks have serviced niche applications like milk floats pushback tugs and forklifts for over a hundred years typically using lead acid batteries but the rapid development of lighter and more energy-dense battery chemistries in the twenty-first century has broadened the range of applicability of electric propulsion to trucks in many more roles Electric trucks reduce noise and pollution relative to internal-combustion trucks Due to the high efficiency and low component-counts of electric power trains no fuel burning while idle and silent and efficient acceleration the costs of owning and operating electric trucks are dramatically lower than their predecessors Long-distance freight has been the trucking segment least amenable to electrification since the increased weight of batteries relative to fuel detracts from payload capacity and the alternative more frequent recharging detracts from delivery time By contrast short-haul urban delivery has been electrified rapidly since the clean and quiet nature of electric trucks fit well with urban planning and municipal regulation and the capacities of reasonably sized batteries are well-suited to daily stop-and-go traffic within a metropolitan area Railborne EVs edit Main article Railway electrification system A tram or streetcar in Hanover drawing current from a single overhead wire through a pantograph The fixed nature of a rail line makes it relatively easy to power EVs through permanent overhead lines or electrified third rails eliminating the need for heavy onboard batteries Electric locomotives electric multiple units electric trams also called streetcars or trolleys electric light rail systems and electric rapid transit are all in common use today especially in Europe and Asia Since electric trains do not need to carry a heavy internal combustion engine or large batteries they can have very good power-to-weight ratios This allows high speed trains such as France s double-deck TGVs to operate at speeds of km h mph or higher and electric locomotives to have a much higher power output than diesel locomotives In addition they have higher short-term surge power for fast acceleration and using regenerative brakes can put braking power back into the electrical grid rather than wasting it Maglev trains are also nearly always EVs There are also battery electric passenger trains operating on non-electrified rail lines Hydrogen trains edit Particularly in Europe fuel-cell electric trains are gaining in popularity to replace diesel electric units In Germany several L nder have ordered Alstom Coradia iLINT trainsets in service since with France also planning to order trainsets The United Kingdom the Netherlands Denmark Norway Italy Canada and Mexico are equally interested In France the SNCF plans to replace all its remaining diesel-electric trains with hydrogen trains by In the United Kingdom Alstom announced in their plan to retrofit British Rail Class trainsets with fuel cells Electric watercraft edit See also Submarine Propulsion Ship Propulsion systems and electric boat Oceanvolt SD electric saildrive motor Electric boats were popular around the turn of the th century Interest in quiet and potentially renewable marine transportation has steadily increased since the late th century as solar cells have given motorboats the infinite range of sailboats Electric motors can and have also been used in sailboats instead of traditional diesel engines Electric ferries operate routinely Submarines use batteries charged by diesel or gasoline engines at the surface nuclear power fuel cells or Stirling engines to run electric motor-driven propellers Fully electric tugboats are being used in Auckland New Zealand June Vancouver British Columbia October and San Diego California Electric aircraft edit Mars helicopter Ingenuity Main article Electric aircraft Since the beginnings of aviation electric power for aircraft has received a great deal of experimentation Currently flying electric aircraft include piloted and unpiloted aerial vehicles Electric spacecraft edit Main article Electrically powered spacecraft propulsion Electric power has a long history of use in spacecraft The power sources used for spacecraft are batteries solar panels and nuclear power Current methods of propelling a spacecraft with electricity include the arcjet rocket the electrostatic ion thruster the Hall-effect thruster and Field Emission Electric Propulsion Space rovers edit Main article Rover space exploration Electric vehicles are the only option for rovers as there is simply no oxygen gas to drive combustion engines in outer space and exoplanetary atmospheres Crewed and uncrewed electric vehicles have been used to explore the Moon and other planets in the Solar System On the last three missions of the Apollo program in and astronauts drove silver-oxide battery -powered Lunar Roving Vehicles distances up to kilometers mi on the lunar surface Solar-powered remotely controlled unscrewed rovers have also explored the Moon and Mars Charging edit Charging stations edit This section is an excerpt from Charging station edit This article is missing information about battery-powered portable DC charging stations and other types of charging stations not used by vehicles Please expand the article to include this information Further details may exist on the talk page August Charging stations for electric vehicles Top-left a Tesla Roadster being charged at an electric charging station in Iwata city Japan Top-right Brammo Empulse electric motorcycle at an AeroVironment charging station and Pay as you go electric vehicle charging point Bottom-left Nissan Leaf recharging from a NRG Energy eVgo station in Houston Texas Bottom-right converted Toyota Priuses recharging at public charging stations in San Francisco California A charging station also known as a charge point chargepoint or electric vehicle supply equipment EVSE is a power supply device that supplies electrical power for recharging the on-board battery packs of plug-in electric vehicles including battery electric vehicles electric trucks electric buses neighborhood electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid vehicles There are two main types of EV chargers alternating current AC charging stations and direct current DC charging stations Electric vehicle batteries can only be charged by direct current electricity while most mains electricity is delivered from the power grid as alternating current For this reason most electric vehicles have a built-in AC-to-DC converter commonly known as the on-board charger OBC At an AC charging station AC power from the grid is supplied to this onboard charger which converts it into DC power to recharge the battery DC chargers provide higher-power charging which requires much larger AC-to-DC converters by building the converter into the charging station to avoid size weight and cost restrictions inside vehicles The station then directly supplies DC power to the vehicle bypassing the onboard converter Most modern electric vehicles can accept both AC and DC power Battery swapping edit Instead of recharging EVs from electric sockets batteries could be mechanically replaced at special stations in a few minutes battery swapping Batteries with greater energy density such as metal air fuel cells cannot always be recharged in a purely electric way so some form of mechanical recharge may be used instead A zinc air battery technically a fuel cell is difficult to recharge electrically so may be refueled by periodically replacing the anode or electrolyte instead Bidirectional charging edit General Motors GM is adding a capability called V H or bidirectional charging to allow its new electric vehicles to send power from their batteries to the owner s home GM will start with models including the Silverado and Blazer EVs and promises to continue the feature through to model year This could be helpful to the owner during unexpected power grid outages because an electric vehicle is a giant battery on wheels Considerations edit Environmental impact edit

operating an EV are in the majority of cases less than those of producing and operating a conventional vehicle When pursuing a cost-responsive electric charging strategy instead of an emission-responsive charging strategy considerably higher emissions might arise as embedded carbon emissions from electricity are dynamic EVs in urban areas almost always pollute less than internal combustion vehicles However EVs are charged with electricity that may be generated by means that have health and environmental impacts This is particularly relevant in places that rely on coal-powered electricity grids It also have negative environmental impacts due to the manufacturing and recycling of batteries The full environmental impact of electric vehicles includes the life cycle impacts of carbon and sulfur emissions as well as toxic metals entering the environment Despite that ICE vehicles use far more raw materials over their lifetime than EVs One source estimates that over a fifth of the lithium and about of the cobalt needed for electric cars will be from recycled sources by On the other hand when counting the large quantities of fossil fuel non-electric cars consume over their lifetime electric cars can be considered to dramatically reduce raw-material needs One limitation of the environmental potential of EVs is that simply switching the existing privately owned car fleet from ICEs to EVs will not free up road space for active travel or public transport Electric micromobility vehicles such as e-bikes may contribute to the decarbonisation of transport systems especially outside of urban areas which are already well-served by public transport Mining extraction and production edit Information regarding the sustainability of the production process of batteries has become a politically charged topic obsolete source Business processes of raw material extraction in practice raise issues of transparency and accountability of the management of extractive resources In the complex supply chain of lithium technology there are diverse stakeholders representing corporate interests public interest groups and political elites that are concerned with outcomes from the technology production and use One possibility to achieve balanced extractive processes would be the establishment of commonly agreed-upon standards on the governance of technology worldwide The compliance of these standards can be assessed by the Assessment of Sustainability in Supply Chains Frameworks ASSC Hereby the qualitative assessment consists of examining governance and social and environmental commitment Indicators for the quantitative assessment are management systems and standards compliance and social and environmental indicators The initial phase of electric vehicle production incurs an environmental cost often referred to as a carbon debt primarily driven by the energy-intensive manufacturing of high-voltage batteries and the extraction of critical raw materials Rare-earth metals neodymium dysprosium and other mined metals copper nickel iron are used by EV motors while lithium cobalt manganese are used by the batteries In the US State Department said that the supply of lithium would need to increase -fold by globally to support a transition to clean energy Most of the lithium-ion battery production occurs in China where the bulk of energy used is supplied by coal-burning power plants The extraction and processing of these metals contributes to habitat destruction and environmental degradation For instance the process of mining minerals such as lithium and cobalt essential components of current battery chemistries carries significant localized environmental hazards Lithium mining frequently conducted using water-intensive brine extraction contributes to global carbon emissions estimated at over million tonnes of carbon annually with every tonne of mined lithium equating to tonnes of CO released into the atmosphere In regions rich in cobalt such as the Democratic Republic of Congo DRC environmental costs are substantial including deforestation habitat destruction and water pollution Scientists have noted high radioactivity levels in some mining regions and industrial processes including the pulverization of rock release dust that causes respiratory health issues for nearby populations Open-pit nickel mining has led to environmental degradation and pollution in developing countries such as the Philippines and Indonesia In nickel mining and processing was one of the main causes of deforestation in Indonesia Geographical distribution of the global battery supply chain In the manufacturing of an EV emitted on average around more CO than an equivalent internal combustion engine vehicle but this difference is more than offset by the much higher emissions from the oil used in driving an internal combustion engine Vehicle over its lifetime compared to those from generating the electricity used for driving the EV In Greenpeace issued a video criticizing the view that EVs are silver bullet for climate arguing that the construction phase has a high environmental impact For example the rise in SUV sales by Hyundai almost eliminate the climate benefits of passing to EV in this company because even electric SUVs have a high carbon footprint as they consume much raw materials and energy during construction Greenpeace proposes a mobility as a service concept instead based on biking public transport and ride sharing Life-cycle assessment edit Despite the initial manufacturing footprint a life-cycle assessment LCA approach consistently confirms that electric vehicles yield superior overall lifetime greenhouse gas GHG performance compared to equivalent ICE vehicles The extent of the environmental benefit is intrinsically linked to the carbon intensity of the electricity grid used to power the vehicle In regions like China battery electric vehicles currently achieve approximately lower emissions compared to ICE vehicles over their full lifespan However in countries with high-intensity grids such as India the immediate advantage is more modest resulting in only about lower emissions saving less than tonnes of CO equivalent This context is temporary as significant efforts are underway globally to decarbonize electricity generation for instance the emissions intensity of India s grid is projected to fall by by rapidly increasing the environmental benefit of electrification An alternative method of sourcing essential battery materials being deliberated by the International Seabed Authority is deep sea mining however carmakers are not using this as of Regulatory mechanisms such as the EU Battery Regulation Regulation EU were introduced to reduce the environmental impact It covers the entire battery life cycle from design and production battery passports to use and end-of-life management There are also national policies like those in France which cap subsidies based on vehicle production carbon intensity Energy efficiency edit EV tank-to-wheels efficiency is about a factor of three higher than internal combustion engine vehicles Energy is not consumed while the vehicle is stationary unlike internal combustion engines which consume fuel while idling In EVs enabled a net reduction of about Mt of GHG emissions on a well-to-wheels basis and the net GHG benefit of EVs will increase over time as the electricity sector is decarbonised Well-to-wheel efficiency of an EV has less to do with the vehicle itself and more to do with the method of electricity production A particular EV would instantly become twice as efficient if electricity production were switched from fossil fuels to renewable energy such as wind power tidal power solar power and nuclear power Thus when well-to-wheels is cited the discussion is no longer about the vehicle but rather about the entire energy supply infrastructure in the case of fossil fuels this should also include energy spent on exploration mining refining and distribution The lifecycle analysis of EVs shows that even when powered by the most carbon-intensive electricity in Europe they emit less greenhouse gases than a conventional diesel vehicle Range edit Main articles All-electric range and range anxiety Electric vehicles may have shorter range compared to vehicles with internal combustion engines which is why the electrification of long-distance transport such as long-distance shipping remains challenging In the sales-weighted average range of small BEVs sold in the United States was nearly km while in France Germany and the United Kingdom it was just under km compared to under km in China Cost of ownership edit Electric vehicles typically carry a higher initial purchase price than comparable ICE vehicles This elevated upfront cost constitutes a significant barrier to entry While long-term financial analyses may favor EVs the immediate capital outlay often dictates purchasing decisions slowing the pace of the overall market transition The higher initial price is often offset by superior total cost of ownership TCO over the vehicle s lifespan Operational expenses for EVs are markedly lower Battery longevity and replacement edit Advances in lithium-ion batteries driven at first by the personal-use electronics industry allow full-sized highway-capable EVs to travel nearly as far on a single charge as conventional cars go on a single tank of gasoline Lithium batteries have been made safe can be recharged in minutes instead of hours see recharging time and now last longer than the typical vehicle see lifespan The production cost of these lighter higher-capacity lithium-ion batteries is gradually decreasing as the technology matures and production volumes increase Research is also underway to improve battery reuse and recycling which would further reduce the environmental impact of batteries Many companies and researchers are also working on newer battery technologies including solid state batteries and alternate technologies The risk of requiring an out-of-warranty battery replacement represents the greatest source of long-term financial uncertainty for many prospective EV retail owners Despite consumer anxieties actual battery replacement events are statistically rare and modern EV batteries are demonstrating significantly greater durability than initially anticipated Studies have confirmed that EV batteries can outlast the vehicle s lifetime with minimal degradation The financial risk associated with future replacement is collapsing due to advancements in battery manufacturing and economics Industry reports project that global market oversupply will persist through accelerating price reductions Performance in extreme climates edit Electric vehicle range and battery performance are negatively affected by extreme cold as ambient temperatures necessitate diverting energy for cabin heating and maintaining optimal battery temperature A comprehensive winter performance study by the Canadian Automobile Association CAA revealed that cold weather significantly impacts driving range with vehicles experiencing reductions between and compared to their official estimates when operated at C This quantifiable range loss presents a significant practical challenge for owners in cold climates However as the industry matures increasing standardization and optimization of these thermal systems are expected to mitigate cold weather range anxiety Heating edit A heat pump system capable of cooling the cabin during summer and heating it during winter is an efficient way of heating and cooling EVs For vehicles which are connected to the grid battery EVs can be preheated or cooled with little or no need for battery energy especially for short trips Most new electric cars come with heat pumps as standard Safety edit Electric vehicle safety regulations have evolved significantly since the initial UN ECE Regulation Current regulations focus on thermal runaway protection with various international standards mandating advance warning systems and thermal propagation containment measures Recent technological developments address thermal runaway concerns more proactively Advanced fire protection materials for EV batteries have become a critical research area with developments in ceramics mica aerogels coatings and phase change materials designed to prevent or delay thermal runaway propagation Current regulations vary by region with China being an early adopter of thermal runaway-specific requirements mandating prevention of fire or smoke exiting battery packs for five minutes after an event occurs However industry experts suggest longer escape times may be necessary for future regulations with original equipment manufacturers targeting extended protection periods to pre-empt future regulatory requirements Research published in the British Medical Journal indicates that electric cars hit pedestrians at twice the rate of petrol or diesel vehicles due to being quieter Repair shops edit The infrastructure for vehicle repairs after accidents is a concern for insurers and mechanics due to safety requirements Although no fatalities have been reported in electric vehicle repair till year repairing the high voltage battery includes electric shock arc flash and fire hazard Batteries and other components must be carefully evaluated rather than being totally written off by insurers Socio-economic edit A study in the United Kingdom found that p ollution is most concentrated in areas where young children and their parents are more likely to live and least concentrated in areas to which the elderly tend to migrate and that those communities that are most polluted and which also emit the least pollution tend to be amongst the poorest in Britain A UK study found that households in the poorest areas emit the least NOx and PM whilst the least poor areas emitted the highest per km vehicle emissions per household through having higher vehicle ownership owning more diesel vehicles and driving further The transport planner Karel Martens in a article warned that electric vehicles only solve the problem of emissions by cars while not solving or improving their impact on the amount of space used by cars or parking issues Martens who is of the field of Transport Justice also said that electric vehicles do not improve accessibility to people who do not own cars Government incentivization edit Main article Government incentives for plug-in electric vehicles See also Electric car use by country The IEA suggests that taxing inefficient internal combustion engine vehicles could encourage adoption of EVs with taxes raised being used to fund subsidies for EVs Government procurement is sometimes used to encourage national EV manufacturers Many countries will ban sales of fossil fuel vehicles between and Many governments offer incentives to promote the use of electric vehicles with the goals of reducing air pollution and oil consumption Some incentives intend to increase purchases of electric vehicles by offsetting the purchase price with a grant Other incentives include lower tax rates or exemption from certain taxes and investment in charging infrastructure In the United States federal tax credits are available for electric vehicle buyers to try and help lower the initial purchase cost European countries like Norway and Germany offer tax exemptions and reduced registration fees to encourage EV adoption Partnerships between EV manufacturers and utility companies have also provided incentives and sales on EV purchases to promote cleaner energy usage and transportation Companies selling EVs have partnered with local electric utilities to provide large incentives on some electric vehicles Infrastructure management edit With the increase in number of electric vehicles it is necessary to create an appropriate number of charging stations to supply the increasing demand While the deployment of public charging infrastructure is accelerating globally the adoption rate of EVs risks outpacing network expansion leading to potential future congestion Experts concur that large-scale EV adoption will inevitably stress local distribution networks if charging is conducted randomly during peak hours of electricity demand This unmanaged demand risks grid instability and necessitates proactive management from utilities In the United States charging ports saw quarterly increases between and in early However projections indicate a measurable risk of insufficient density In the US the ratio of electric light-duty vehicles per public charging point is projected to climb dramatically from approximately in to over by This sharply increasing ratio confirms that current deployment while active may be structurally insufficient to prevent charging queues unless aggressive government targets such as the US objective of public charging ports by are met and exceeded Policy mandates are driving targeted deployment to alleviate infrastructure pressure The US has announced subsidies to expand convenient charging and countries like India have set requirements for installing chargers every km along major highways Logistical hurdles regarding charge times are being addressed by rapid advancements in charging technology Commercially available DC fast charging stations currently deliver - kW and regulatory frameworks such as the EU s Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Regulation AFIR are preparing for the eventual commercialization of MW charging stations The transition to MW charging however requires significant investment in both installation and grid upgrades Stabilization of the grid edit Vehicle-to-grid V G charger where energy can flow back into the grid if needed Since EVs can be plugged into the electric grid when not in use battery-powered vehicles could reduce the need for dispatchable generation by feeding electricity into the grid from their batteries during periods of high demand and low supply such as just after sunset while doing most of their charging at night or midday when there is unused generating capacity This vehicle-to-grid V G connection has the potential to reduce the need for new power plants as long as vehicle owners do not mind reducing the life of their batteries by being drained by the power company during peak demand Electric vehicle parking lots can provide demand response Current electricity infrastructure may need to cope with increasing shares of variable-output power sources such as wind and solar This variability could be addressed by adjusting the speed at which EV batteries are charged or possibly even discharged Some concepts see battery exchanges and battery charging stations much like gas petrol stations today These will require enormous storage and charging potentials which could be manipulated to vary the rate of charging and to output power during shortage periods much as diesel generators are used for short periods to stabilize some national grids In-development technologies edit Main article Electric double-layer capacitor Conventional electric double-layer capacitors supercapacitors continue to be developed to achieve higher energy densities while maintaining their characteristic fast charging capabilities and extended lifespans Recent research has focused on solid-state supercapacitor configurations that eliminate liquid electrolytes providing enhanced safety and design flexibility Advanced developments include all-graphene oxide flexible solid-state supercapacitors with enhanced electrochemical performance achieving areal capacitances of mF cm among the highest values for any graphene-based supercapacitor Recent breakthroughs include dual storage mechanism nanoscale solid-state lithium-ion supercapacitors utilizing atomic layer deposition-synthesized lithium phosphorus oxynitride LiPON as solid-state electrolyte demonstrating capacitance densities of nF mm with excellent cycling stability over ten thousand cycles High-performance solid-state supercapacitors have been developed using silicon electrodes with graphene interconnected networks showing remarkable performance characteristics comparable to high-power carbon-based supercapacitors Advanced hybrid designs include all-solid-state planar micro-supercapacitors based on D vanadium nitride nanosheets and cobalt hydroxide nanoflowers achieving energy densities of mWh cm and power densities of mW cm Flexible solid-state supercapacitors operating across wide temperature ranges from - C to C have been demonstrated using polycation-polybenzimidazole blend electrolytes doped with phosphoric acid Battery advancements edit Solid-state batteries represent one of the most promising next-generation battery technologies offering potential advantages over conventional lithium-ion batteries including higher energy density faster charging improved safety and longer lifespan According to a comprehensive review in Chemical Engineering Journal all-solid-state lithium batteries utilizing solid electrolytes are regarded as the next generation of energy storage devices with recent breakthroughs significantly accelerating their path toward commercial viability The Fraunhofer ISI Solid-State Battery Roadmap developed with contributions from more than European experts provides a comprehensive assessment of solid-state battery development potential over the next decade benchmarking against established lithium-ion batteries According to market analysis published in Scientific Talks solid-state batteries are projected to reach mass production with costs of USD per kWh by depending on technological and manufacturing challenges Recent commercial developments include Mercedes-Benz and Factorial Energy conducting road tests of semi-solid-state batteries in the EQS sedan promising a increase in range with energy densities of watt-hours per kilogram This represents the world s first integration of lithium-metal solid-state batteries into a production vehicle However according to IEEE Spectrum analysis solid-state batteries face significant production hell challenges with experts noting pointed skepticism toward current technical announcements and the engineering obstacles that lie ahead Toyota continues to lead development efforts targeting solid-state battery production by with goals of km range and -minute fast charging capabilities The company claims recent technological advancements have overcome previous battery life trade-offs and switched focus to mass production readiness Research published in ACS Energy Letters emphasizes that while all-solid-state batteries show promise for electric vehicles significant challenges remain in Li-metal implementation interfacial stability and large-scale manufacturing Sodium-ion batteries continue to show promise with potential energy densities of Wh kg and minimal expansion contraction during charge cycles while relying on more abundant and cost-effective materials than lithium-ion technology Recent research published in Energy Fuels highlights sodium-ion and all-solid-state sodium batteries as promising choices for future energy storage systems due to abundant sodium resources and lower costs compared to lithium-based systems Battery management and intermediate storage edit Another improvement is to decouple the electric motor from the battery through electronic control using supercapacitors to buffer large but short power demands and regenerative braking energy The development of new cell types combined with intelligent cell management improved both weak points mentioned above The cell management involves not only monitoring the health of the cells but also a redundant cell configuration one more cell than needed With sophisticated switched wiring it is possible to condition one cell while the rest are on duty citation needed Electric roads edit Main article Electric road Three types of electric road systems An electric bus black receives power from the road A with three inductive pickups red from a strip of resonant inductive coils blue embedded several centimeters under the road gray B with a current collector red sliding over a ground-level power supply rail segment blue flush with the surface of the road gray C with an overhead current collector red sliding against a powered overhead line blue An electric road system ERS is a road which supplies electric power to vehicles travelling on it Common implementations are overhead power lines above the road ground-level power supply through conductive rails and dynamic wireless power transfer DWPT through resonant inductive coils or inductive rails embedded in the road Overhead power lines are limited to commercial vehicles while ground-level rails and inductive power transfer can be used by any vehicle which allows for public charging through a power metering and billing systems Of the three methods ground-level conductive rails are estimated to be the most cost-effective National electric road projects edit Government studies and trials have been conducted in several countries seeking a national electric road network Korea was the first to implement an induction-based public electric road with a commercial bus line in after testing an experimental shuttle service in but it was shut down due to aging infrastructure amidst controversy over the continued public funding of the technology United Kingdom municipal projects in and found wireless electric roads financially unfeasible Sweden has been performing assessments of various electric road technologies since under the Swedish Transport Administration electric road program After receiving electric road construction offers in excess of the project s budget in Sweden pursued cost-reduction measures for either wireless or rail electric roads The project s final report was published in which recommended against funding a national electric road network in Sweden as it would not be cost-effective unless the technology was adopted by its trading partners such as by France and Germany In December the Swedish Transport Administration announced a pause in plans for the country s first permanent electric road citing cost-benefit concerns and technological uncertainty However pilot projects for dynamic charging continue internationally including in Germany and South Korea Germany found in that the wireless electric road system wERS by Electreon collects of the transmitted energy poses many difficulties during installation and blocks access to other infrastructure in the road Germany trialed overhead lines in three projects and reported they are too expensive difficult to maintain and pose a safety risk France found similar drawbacks for overhead lines as Germany did France began several electric road pilot projects in

transit Personal rapid transit Category Renewable energy portal v t e An electric bicycle e-bike electrically assisted pedal cycle or electrically power assisted cycle is a bicycle with an integrated electric motor used to assist propulsion Many kinds of e-bikes are available worldwide but they generally fall into two broad categories bikes that assist the rider s pedal-power i e pedelecs and bikes that add a throttle integrating moped -style functionality Both retain the ability to be pedaled by the rider and are therefore not electric motorcycles E-bikes use rechargeable batteries and typically are motor-powered up to to km h to mph High-powered varieties can often travel up to or more than km h mph depending on the model and riding conditions Depending on local laws many e-bikes e g pedelecs are legally classified as bicycles rather than mopeds or motorcycles This exempts them from the more stringent laws regarding the certification and operation of more powerful two-wheelers which are often classed as electric motorcycles such as licensing and mandatory safety equipment E-bikes can also be defined separately and treated under distinct electric bicycle laws Bicycles e-bikes and e-scooters alongside e-cargo bikes are commonly classified as micro-mobility vehicles When comparing bicycles e-bikes and e-scooters from active and inclusiveness perspectives traditional bicycles while promoting physical activity are less accessible to certain demographics due to the need for greater physical exertion which also limits the distances bicycles can cover compared to e-bikes and e-scooters E-scooters however cannot be categorized as an active transport mode as they require minimal physical effort and therefore offer no health benefits E-bikes stand out as the only option that combines the benefits of active transport with inclusivity as their electric-motor pedal-assist feature helps riders cover greater distances The motor helps users overcome obstacles such as steep inclines and the need for high physical effort making e-bikes suitable for a wide variety of users This feature also allows e-bikes to traverse distances that would typically necessitate the use of private cars or multi-modal travel such as both a bicycle and local public transport establishing them as not only an active and inclusive mode but also a standalone travel option History edit This section needs expansion You can help by adding to it March s to s edit A man with a Gazelle bicycle with an electrically powered motor In the s electric bicycles were documented within various U S patents For example on December Ogden Bolton Jr was granted a patent for a battery-powered bicycle with -pole brush-and-commutator direct current DC hub motor mounted in the rear wheel U S patent There were no gears and the motor could draw up to amperes from a -volt battery Two years later in Hosea W Libbey of Boston invented an electric bicycle U S patent that was propelled by a double electric motor The motor was designed within the hub of the crankset axle This model was later re-invented and imitated in the late s by Giant Lafree e-bikes citation needed By a rear-wheel drive electric bicycle which used a driving belt along the outside edge of the wheel was patented by Mathew J Steffens An patent by John Schnepf U S patent depicted an electric bicycle with a rear-wheel friction roller-wheel -style drive In Schnepf s invention was expanded by G A Wood Jr U S patent Wood s device used four fractional horsepower motors connected through a series of gears Hub motors fell out of favor until the latter part of the first decade of the s when they made a resurgence on inexpensive electric bicycles s to present day edit From Vector Services Limited offered the Zike e-bike The bicycle included nickel cadmium battery NiCad batteries that were built into a frame member and included an g oz permanent-magnet motor Torque sensors and power controls were developed during the late s For example a Japanese patent was granted in to a team led by Yutaka Takada for a Sensor drive force auxiliary device and torque sensor zero point adjusting mechanism American car executive Lee Iacocca founded EV Global Motors in a company that produced an electric bicycle model named E-bike SX and it was one of the early efforts to popularize e-bikes in the US By e-bikes were thought to make up to percent of all two-wheeled vehicles on the streets of many major Chinese cities A typical unit requires eight hours to charge the battery which provides the range of to kilometres to mi at the speed of around km h mph In the s electric bicycles attracted considerable traction in Europe led by government policies and environmental awareness encouraging sustainable technologies Some countries such as Germany and Netherlands turned into significant e-bikes markets with the aim to reduce urban congestion and carbon emissions Moreover the evolution of lithium-ion battery Li-ion technology contributed to e-bikes adoption They provided faster charging times lighter weight and longer range in order to make e-bikes more efficient and practical for daily use Definition and classes edit As of update many countries do not have quality standards for ebikes rules about who can ride them and where or even a clear legal definition of what they are E-bikes are classed according to the power that their electric motor can deliver and the control system i e when and how the power from the motor is applied Also the classification of e-bikes is complicated as much of the definition is due to the legality of what constitutes a bicycle and what constitutes a moped or motorcycle As such the classification of these e-bikes varies greatly across countries and local jurisdictions Despite these legal complications the classification of e-bikes is mainly decided by whether the e-bike s motor assists the rider using a pedal-assist system or by a power-on-demand one Definitions of these are as follows With pedal-assist the electric motor is regulated by pedaling The pedal-assist augments the efforts of the rider when they are pedaling These e-bikes called pedelecs have a sensor to detect the pedaling speed the pedaling force or both Brake activation is sensed to disable the motor as well With power-on-demand the motor is activated by a throttle usually handlebar-mounted just like on most motorcycles or scooters Therefore very broadly e-bikes can be classed as E-bikes with pedal-assist only either pedelecs legally classed as bicycles or S-Pedelecs often legally classed as mopeds Pedelecs have pedal-assist only motor assists only up to a decent but not excessive speed usually km h or mph motor power up to W hp often legally classed as bicycles S-Pedelecs have pedal-assist only motor power can be greater than W hp can attain a higher speed e g km h or mph before motor stops assisting sometimes legally classed as a moped or motorcycle E-bikes with power-on-demand and pedal-assist E-bikes with power-on-demand only frequently have more powerful motors than pedelecs The more powerful of these are legally classed as mopeds or motorcycles but may not meet the legal requirements for registration as street-legal motorcycles Pedal-assist only edit E-bikes with pedal-assist only are usually called pedelecs but can be broadly classified into pedelecs proper and the more powerful S-Pedelecs Pedelecs edit Main article Pedelec The term pedelec from pedal electric cycle refers to a pedal-assist e-bike with a relatively low-powered electric motor and a decent but not excessive top speed Pedelecs are legally classed as bicycles rather than low-powered motorcycles or mopeds The most influential definition of pedelecs comes from the EU EU directive EN standard for motor vehicles considers a bicycle to be a pedelec if The pedal-assist i e the motorized assistance only engages when the rider is pedaling The motor cuts out once km h mph is reached and The motor produces maximum continuous rated power of not more than W hp the motor can produce more power for short periods such as when the rider is struggling to get up a steep hill An e-bike conforming to these conditions is considered to be a pedelec in the EU and is legally classed as a bicycle The EN standard is valid across the whole of the EU and has been adopted by some non-EU European nations including the UK and also some non-European jurisdictions such as the state of Victoria in Australia Pedelecs are much like conventional bicycles in use and function the electric motor only provides assistance for example when the rider is climbing or struggling against a headwind Pedelecs are therefore especially useful for people in hilly areas where riding a bike would prove too strenuous for many to consider taking up cycling as a daily means of transport They are also useful for riders who more generally need some assistance e g for people with heart leg muscle or knee joint issues S-Pedelecs edit More powerful pedelecs which are not legally classed as bicycles are dubbed S-Pedelecs short for Schnell-Pedelecs i e Speedy-Pedelecs in Germany These have a motor more powerful than W hp and less limited or unlimited pedal-assist i e the motor does not stop assisting the rider once km h mph has been reached S-Pedelec class e-bikes are therefore usually classified as mopeds or motorcycles rather than as bicycles and therefore may depending on the jurisdiction need to be registered and insured the rider may need some sort of driver s license either car or motorcycle and motorcycle helmets may have to be worn In the United States many states have adopted S-Pedelecs into the Class category limited to W hp of power and km h mph speed In Europe they are likely to be classed as mopeds requiring a registration plate and a licensed driver In Australia they can only be used on private property Power-on-demand and pedal-assist edit Some newer electric bikes include a pedal assist system PAS with or without throttle allowing riders to pedal while using the electric motor to increase range There are electric propulsion conversion kits for ordinary bicycles citation needed Power-on-demand only edit Some e-bikes have an electric motor that operates on a power-on-demand basis only the motor is engaged and operated manually using a throttle with control usually on the handgrip as on a motorbike or scooter These sorts of e-bikes often but not always have more powerful motors than pedelecs citation needed With power-on-demand only e-bikes the rider can ride by pedal power alone i e fully human-powered ride by electric motor alone by operating the throttle manually ride using both together at the same time Some power-on-demand only e-bikes are very different from and cannot be classified as bicycles For example the Noped is a term used by the Ministry of Transportation of Ontario for e-bikes which are not fitted with pedals citation needed Popularity edit Another reason ebikes are popular is the low cost to charge such as this e-bike which which costs cents to charge and able to provide km mi of range at km h mph E-bike usage worldwide has experienced rapid growth since China is the world s leading producer of e-bikes According to the data of the China Bicycle Association a government-chartered industry group in China s manufacturers sold million e-bikes nationwide which was almost twice the year sales domestic sales reached million in and to million in In approximately million electric bikes were used daily in China According to trade umbrella body CONEBI electric bike sales in the EU were over million in up from million e-bikes in up from in and in In the EU implemented a protective tariff on imported Chinese e-bikes to protect EU producers In electric bikes continued to grow market share in the EU rising to of bike sales in the Netherlands in Austria in Germany and in Belgium Motors and drivetrains edit Electric bike with motor mounted in the front wheel DC motors are commonly used in electric bicycles either brushed or brushless Many configurations are available varying in cost and complexity direct-drive and geared motor units are both used An electric power-assist system may be added to almost any pedal cycle using chain drive belt drive hub motors or friction drive citation needed Brushless hub motors are the most common in modern designs The motor is built into the wheel hub itself while the stator is fixed solidly to the axle and the magnets are attached to and rotating with the wheel The bicycle wheel hub is the motor The power levels of motors used are influenced by available legal categories and are often but not always limited to under watts With a front-drive the motor sits in the front hub and with a rear-drive the motor sits in the rear hub citation needed Hub motors were common in th century electric bicycle designs but fell out of favor until their resurgence in the s Another type of electric assist motor is the mid-drive system where the electric motor is not built into the wheel but is usually mounted beside or under the bottom bracket shell The propulsion is provided at the pedals rather than at the wheel being eventually applied to the wheel via the bicycle s standard drive train Freewheel crank that is a freewheel in the bottom bracket is a necessary part in mid-drive systems to allow the electric motor to work inside its optimal rotational speed range r min citation needed Because the power is applied through the chain and sprocket power is typically limited to around watts to protect against fast wear on the drivetrain citation needed An electric mid-drive combined with an internal gear hub at the back hub may require care due to the lack of a clutch mechanism to soften the shock to the gears at the moment of re-engagement A continuously variable transmission or a fully automatic internal gear hub may reduce the shocks due to the viscosity of oils used for liquid coupling instead of the mechanical couplings of the conventional internal gear hubs citation needed The main advantage mid-drive motors have over hub motors is that power is applied through the chain or belt and thus it uses the existing rear gears either external or internal This allows for the motor to operate more efficiently at a wider range of vehicle speeds Without using the bicycle s gears equivalent hub motors tend to be less effective propelling the ebike slowly up steep hills and also propelling the ebike fast on the flat citation needed Batteries edit E-bike charging station Germany E-bikes use rechargeable batteries in addition to electric motors and some form of control Battery systems in use include sealed lead acid SLA nickel cadmium NiCad nickel metal hydride NiMH or lithium-ion polymer Li-ion Batteries vary according to the voltage total charge capacity amp hours weight the number of charging cycles before performance degrades and ability to handle over-voltage charging conditions The energy costs of operating e-bikes are small but there can be considerable battery replacement costs in particular in the case of premature failure The lifespan of a battery pack varies depending on the type of usage including charging temperature Room-temperature charging and shallow discharge recharge cycles help extend the overall battery life In the case of the most-used Li-ion batteries there is no memory effect and thus no penalty in shallow charge cycles apart from the reduced range per charge Range is a key consideration with e-bikes and is affected by factors such as motor efficiency battery capacity efficiency of the driving electronics aerodynamics hills and weight of the bike and rider Some manufacturers such as the Canadian BionX or American Vintage Electric Bikes have the option of using regenerative braking the motor acts as a generator to slow the bike down prior to the brake pads engaging This is useful for extending the range and the life of brake pads and wheel rims There are also experiments using fuel cells e g the PHB Some experiments have also been undertaken with super capacitors to supplement or replace batteries for cars and some SUVS E-bikes developed in Switzerland in the late s for the Tour de Sol solar vehicle race used solar charging stations initially on-vehicle and later fixed on roofs and connected so as to feed into the electric mains The bicycles were then charged from the mains as is common today Lithium ion batteries used in e-bikes and related vehicles such as electric scooters have been under scrutiny since due to their susceptibility to overheating and catching fire The more expensive Lithium iron phosphate LFP batteries have safer thermal characteristics and are non-toxic A rise in incidents where e-bike batteries were implicated in fires has been attributed to increases in popularity and lack of regulations Lower-quality batteries are more likely to be manufactured with defects that can cause bulging or bursting however there is an incredibly low instance of issue among larger more established manufacturers with chargers that avoid over voltage In the world s largest electric bike maker Giant Manufacturing went on record to say that it had never experienced an issue with a single battery Gig workers who rely on using e-bikes to do their jobs may also be limited in their choice of vehicle and purchase a cheap or second-hand e-bike that is more prone to damage Some jurisdictions such as New York City and San Francisco have passed laws requiring that all electric mobility devices sold have UL safety certifications Design variations edit Not all e-bikes take the form of conventional push-bikes with an incorporated motor such as the Cytronex bicycles which use a small battery disguised as a water bottle Converting a non-electric bicycle to its electric equivalent can be complicated but numerous replace a wheel solutions are now available on the market Electric cargo bikes allow the rider to carry large heavy items which would be difficult to transport without electric power supplementing the human power input These bikes can also allow for adults to continue biking into parenthood enabling the transportation of children without using a car There are many e-bikes design variations available some with batteries attached to the frame some housed within the tube Some use fat tires for improved stability and off-road capability Various designs including those mentioned above are designed to fit inside most area laws and the ones that contain pedals can be used on roads in the United Kingdom among other countries Folding e-bikes are also available Electric self-balancing unicycles do not conform to e-bike legislation in most countries and therefore cannot be used on the road but may be legal to use on the sidewalk They are the cheapest electric cycles and used by the last mile commuters for urban use and to be combined with public transport including buses They are not legal for use on the public highway including footways and cycle paths in the United Kingdom Tricycles edit See also e-tricycle Electric trikes have also been produced that conform to the e-bike legislation These have the benefit of additional low speed stability and are often favored by people with disabilities Cargo carrying tricycles are also gaining acceptance with a small but growing number of couriers using them for package deliveries in city centers Latest designs of these trikes resemble a cross-between a pedal cycle and a small van Diagram illustrating a standard bicycle converted to an e-bike using a retail conversion kit A folding e-bike A modern electric cargo trike in use in London with a payload of up to kg lb Electric unicycle Some vehicles might not technically be an electric bicycle but might be grouped in that category by transportation authorities Health effects edit Electric bicycle usage can have several health benefits and rider safety can be improved through the use of a helmet One research shows that E-bike use increased the amount of physical activity E-bike users in seven European cities had higher weekly energy expenditure than other cyclists because they cycled longer trips However a study from University of Tennessee provides evidence that energy expenditure EE and oxygen consumption VO for e-bikes are lower than that for conventional bicycles and lower than for walking Further the study notes that the difference between e-bikes and bicycles are most pronounced on the uphill segments E-bikes can also provide a source of exercise for individuals who have trouble exercising for an extended time due to injury or excessive weight for example as the bike can allow the rider to take short breaks from pedaling and also provide confidence to the rider that they ll be able to complete the selected path without becoming too fatigued or without having forced their knee joints too hard people who need to use their knee joints without wearing them out unnecessarily may in some electric bikes adjust the level of motor assistance according to the terrain There are individuals who claim to have lost considerable amounts of weight by using an electric bike A recent prospective cohort study however found that people using e-bikes have a higher BMI than those using conventional bikes By making the biking terrain less of an issue people who would not otherwise consider biking can use the electric assistance when needed and otherwise pedal as they are able E-bikes can be a useful part of cardiac rehabilitation programs since health professionals will often recommend a stationary bike be used in the early stages of these Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation programs can reduce deaths in people with coronary heart disease by around Road traffic safety edit Schleinitz et al concluded that e-bike users in Germany were no more likely than conventional cyclists to be involved in safety-critical situations However Dozza et al concluded from an analysis of Swedish cyclists that e-bikers may be involved in more critical incidents but with lower severity Additionally e-bikers were less likely to have dangerous interactions with motorized vehicles In the United States an estimated e-bike-related emergency department visits occurred between and During this period there were e-bike fatalities accounting for of all micromobility -related deaths Environmental effects edit Delivery by e-bike can be more efficient in dense urban environments where parking is not always available for larger vehicles E-bikes are zero-emissions vehicles as they emit no combustion by-products but the environmental effects of electricity generation and power distribution and of manufacturing and recycling batteries must be accounted for E-bikes emit similar pollutants per kilometer as buses citation needed with emission rates several times lower than motorcycles and cars E-bikes are generally seen as environmentally desirable in an urban environment A study in England found that e-bikes if used to replace car travel have the capability to cut car carbon dioxide CO emissions in England by up to about million tonnes per year A study focusing on the Yorkshire region of England suggested that the greatest opportunities are in rural and sub-urban settings city dwellers already have many low-carbon travel options so the greatest impact would be on encouraging use outside urban areas The study further suggested there may also be scope for e-bikes to help people who are most affected by rising transport costs The environmental effects involved in recharging the batteries can of course be reduced The small size of the battery pack on an e-bike relative to the larger pack used in an electric car makes them very good candidates for charging via solar power or other renewable energy resources Sanyo capitalized on this benefit when it set up solar parking lots in which e-bike riders can charge their vehicles while parked under photovoltaic panels The environmental credentials of e-bikes and electric human powered hybrids generally have led some municipal authorities to use them such as Little Rock Arkansas with their Wavecrest electric power-assisted bicycles or Cloverdale California police with Zap e-bikes China s e-bike manufacturers such as Xinri are now partnering with universities in a bid to improve their technology in line with international environmental standards backed by the Chinese government who is keen to improve the export potential of the Chinese manufactured e-bikes Both land management regulators and mountain bike trail access advocates have argued for bans of electric bicycles on outdoor trails that are accessible to mountain bikes citing potential safety hazards as well as the potential for electric bikes to damage trails A study conducted by the International Mountain Bicycling Association however found that the physical impacts of low-powered pedal-assist electric mountain bikes eMTB may be similar to traditional mountain bikes MTB A study on the environment impact of e-bikes versus other forms of transportation found that e-bikes are times more energy efficient than an SUV times more energy efficient than a sedan times more energy efficient than rail transit Of about equal impact to the environment as a conventional bicycle There are strict shipping regulations for lithium-ion batteries due to safety concerns In this regard lithium iron phosphate batteries are safer than lithium cobalt oxide batteries Experience by country edit Legislation has led to more e-bike usage in China with e-bike rentals catering to that growth Pedelecs from the Call a Bike bicycle hire scheme in Berlin Delivery e-bike with license plate in Manhattan New York City Police e-bikes in S o Paulo Brazil China edit China has experienced an explosive growth of sales of non-assisted e-bikes including scooter type with annual sales jumping from units in to over million in and reaching an estimated fleet of million e-bikes in early This boom was triggered by Chinese local governments efforts to restrict motorcycles in city centers to avoid traffic disruption and accidents By late motorcycles were banned or restricted in over ninety major Chinese cities Commuters began replacing traditional bicycles and motorcycles and e-bike became an alternative to commuting by car Nevertheless road safety concerns continue as around e-bike related deaths were registered in By late ten cities had also banned or imposed restrictions on e-bikes on the same grounds as motorcycles Among these cities were Guangzhou Shenzhen Changsha Foshan Changzhou and Dongguang In April China s regulatory policies changed and new standards around electric bikes were introduced governing a bicycle s weight maximum speed and nominal voltage among other factors Vehicles which apply the new standard including international km h speed limit are legally considered as bicycles and do not require registration E-bikes out of this standard are considered as motorcycles and are subject to helmet and license regulation China is the world s leading manufacturer of e-bikes with million units produced in Some of the biggest manufacturers of E-bikes in the world are BYD and Geoby Production is concentrated in five regions Tianjin Zhejiang Jiangsu Shandong and Shanghai China exported e-bikes in In about China companies were in businesses related to the electric-bike industry As of there are million registered ebikes New ebikes must be made from fire resistant plastic be at least metal and a max weight of kg Netherlands edit The Netherlands has a fleet of million bicycles for its population of million as of E-bikes have reached a market share of by as e-bikes sales quadrupled from units to between and and the electric-powered models represented of the total bicycle sales revenue in that year By early one in every eight bicycles sold in the country is electric-powered despite the fact that on average an e-bike is three times more expensive than a regular bicycle E-bike sales have now overtaken those of unpowered bikes reaching in and in A market survey showed that the average distance traveled in the Netherlands by commuters on a standard bicycle is kilometres mi while with an e-bike this distance increases to kilometres mi This survey also showed that e-bike ownership is particularly popular among people aged and over but limited among commuters The e-bike is used in particular for recreational bicycle trips shopping and errands United States edit In the U S had an estimated fleet of e-bikes In they were increasingly favored in New York as food-delivery vehicles The North American Electric Bike Market is expected to grow at a CAGR of from to fat tire ebike continental divide rocky mountains USA India edit In India electric bicycles market was valued at US million in and is expected to reach US million by projecting a CAGR of during this forecast period
